The 5 most highly regulated countries from a financial advisor's perspective are Australia, United Kingdom, South Africa, United States and Canada.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at seven key strategies based on research on what successful advisor's implement in providing value to their clients.</p><h3> 1. Time <br/>  </h3><p> Hours planned in working on their business. In a one year time frame &ndash; Project 100 - (you need 100 hours to implement change into your business such as updating your value promise, going fee based or implementing new technologies. It is called project 100 because you will need to spend 2-3 hours per week for one year or 100 hours on building key practice management processes. The first step is to plan them in your calendar each week 2 hours working on your business. Plan the time first. For example every Wednesday from 8-10 or 11am working on the business implementing processes.</p><h3> 2. Business models - your goals, your clients and your business model <br/>  </h3><p> Does your business goals align with your clients? Managing a large financial advisory business is great if it matches your ideal client profile and creates a win-win relationship. When consulting with advisor's, they have stated they want to build their practice and manage 100-200 million of assets or more. Then they want to slow down and work less. A business model does not work that way. Find a person (coach, consultant, mentor) who can help you build the business model and ideal clientele you want to create.</p><h3> 3. Client feedback - what clients value, without this all else will be average <br/>  </h3><p> According to Business Health Pty Ltd., ( Business Health, Key Value Drivers US 2013) only 15% of advisors in the United States have a formal feedback processes for their clients.Those advisors that have a formal feedback system earn up to 52% more than advisor's who do not have a feedback system. A similar study had similar results by the USA FPA Research and Practice Institute study - Future of Practice Management -December 2013. If you want to become a &ldquo;ideal client focused advisor&rdquo; then build a formal feedback process into your client reviews.</p><h3> 4. Ideal client profile <br/>  </h3><p> Creating a win-win on communication, compensation and expectations. What is your ideal future client profile. Have it detailed and do a case study and put it on your website for the world to see.</p><h3> 5. Ideal client service capacity <br/>  </h3><p> The 60 / 40 principle. More than 60% of your time should be spent seeing ideal clients- very few advisor's do that because they use the excuse of too much administration and lack of processes. A quick way to find your capacity for your clients is to add up the number of hours you work each year, say 1800 hours. Then find out what percent of time you service clients. Segment the clients into your main groups or segments. Then find out how much time you spend servicing each segment and add it up. The math may reveal some interesting capacity issues.</p><h3> 6. Document <br/>  </h3><p> Put your value promise in writing and make it a process. Make a list of ALL your services and how you deliver value through those services. The critical part is the documented process that you use with clients to help them solve their problems. The document is not to showcase you, but the clearly outline how you uncover clients problems and how you solve them.</p><h3> 7. Ongoing services document <br/>  </h3><p> Build your client experience document. As a client what do I get for the fee I pay each year? Consider re-engage existing clients with an innovative and detailed review process and adding more value and services. Then build a document to show clients your detailed process for delivering your &ldquo;value added review service&rdquo;.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-16 15:14:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-16 15:14:26.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_ljcxHQj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-research-based-strategies-for-advisors-to-provide-better-value-to-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"11819\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-16 15:14:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-16 15:14:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-research-based-strategies-for-advisors-to-provide-better-value-to-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11818\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5760\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7-Research-Based-Strategies-for-Advisors-to-Provide-Better-Value-to-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"560\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466157600,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

We find them in sports, business, and even our personal relationships. Different talents and skills combined together gives you synergy so you accomplish more as a team than you can as an individual. Is it time to take the team concept to the next level?</p><p> In my initial consultation with advisors, I really get to know all aspects of their practice. One of the questions I ask is, How would you describe the service you are getting from your broker/dealer?</p><p> A recent response peaked my interest: They are trying. I could hear the  but  hanging in the air. I remain quiet as the advisor goes on to describe the recent reorganization of the operations service department.</p><p> The concept looks good on paper. They have formed service teams so that an advisor is not completely dependent on just one person. Each team has five individuals who are assigned to your office and are knowledgeable about all of your challenges. So, if one person is not available, another person will easily be able to handle your question.</p><h3> What's the problem, I ask. It sounds like an efficient operation.</h3><p> <br/> The advisor tells me that his staff can only work with two of the five people on the team. Its not about knowledge, although one person may be a bit lacking in certain subjects. Its not even about waiting in a long queue to get a live person on the line because the firm doesnt have an automated voice system.</p><p> Where the challenge lies is in the  relationship . Most of my staff are detailed information need people. They will always ask the next question. They are confident and experienced in this industry. So, when the service person they talk to sounds irritated that they asked another question, the relationship is damaged. In another case, the service person sounded hesitant in a response and when my staff asked them to verify the answer, the individual was reluctant. Again, the relationship is damaged.</p><p> After three months, the advisor finally had to ask the supervisor for help. Now his staff only works with the two service people who built a good relationship by understanding how to create a unique experience for each of his staff.</p><h3> It's time to add the missing piece of behavior-based solutions to service teams.</h3><p> <br/> Imagine calling into a service center and the call being directed to the service person that is most like you! The interaction is easy and effortless because the service employee does not have to change or dramatically adapt their style to you. Less energy drain for the service person allows them to concentrate on giving you the information in exactly the style that works for you. And, you will make less repeat calls because you understand the answer the FIRST time you make the call.</p><p> The metrics of the service center are improved. More calls are answered correctly the first time. Your clients are happier. You will notice more positive responses on surveys from clients. The service center staff has more energy to make more outbound calls.</p><p> The advisors business metrics are improved. The advisor can spend more time with clients. The support staff has to make fewer repeat calls to the service center. So that means more time to interact with your clients. Ultimately, revenues increase as a result of focused engagement with your clients.</p><h3> Service center wins, advisor wins and broker-dealer gets more business and referrals.</h3><p> <br/> Are you ready for the NEXT level of unique customer service experiences?</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-16 15:18:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-16 15:18:01.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_nRhFVV8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-would-you-describe-the-service-you-are-getting-from-your-broker-dealer/\", \"post_id\": \"11821\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-16 15:18:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-16 15:18:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-would-you-describe-the-service-you-are-getting-from-your-broker-dealer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11820\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5761\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-Would-You-Describe-the-Service-You-Are-Getting-From-Your-Broker-Dealer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"471\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466150400,"author_id":384,"chart_url":""}

A Look at the How and Why","link":"are-you-being-human-with-your-marketing-a-look-at-the-how-and-why","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As many marketing managers scramble to get their work done, many look for shortcuts. Companies are outsourcing writing, or even buying machine-generated content, to meet the demand. But how do you balance the time commitment for creating content and SEO with the need to connect with those reading it? How will you make your marketing more human?</p><p> Marketing technology is always on the cutting edge. Every time you login to LinkedIn, you read reports of new services, new products, and even new kinds of intelligence that are changing the world we live in and how we market our businesses.</p><p> Think of what&rsquo;s changed in the last 2 years alone!</p><p> One of the latest trends is automating content production, with companies like Persado, Automated Insights, and Narrative Science taking customers and funding and promising that the content is just as good as any human could write.</p><p> Are we for automation here at Whittington Consulting? Yes and no. Careful marketing automation can be a huge time-saver and help your customers get the information they need to make purchasing decisions. Automating lead followup &mdash; done properly &mdash; can save your sales reps time while making sure that every lead gets communication.</p><p> Machine-generated content, on the other hand, or even content from content mills, is a whole different beast. In some cases, it can help with SEO, but it can also damage your relationship with customers once they click through to your website and discover content that lacks meaning and substance.</p><p> In addition to the risks associated with using automated content to represent your company, it also inspires a question that every company needs to consider regardless of where they source their content: how do we balance the technical needs of content and marketing (such as SEO) with the need to relate to people that you sell to?</p><h3> Why Balance SEO With Readability?</h3><p> The purpose of SEO content is to show up for relevant, common searches in hopes that people will visit your website. It signals to search engines that your website is full of rich, informative information for the person searching.</p><p> While keywords and context are vital components of the SEO process, they must be balanced with the fact that business does and always will come down to people, not search engines.</p><p> The purpose of social media marketing is to reach people where they are. The purpose of email marketing is to reach people in their inbox. The purpose of SEO is to reach people searching for answers.</p><h3> Do you see where this is going?</h3><p> All of your marketing should make connections with people that might have a need for what your company sells. The content you create and the marketing strategy you implement needs to be equally human to meet their needs. The technical side of marketing &mdash; HTML tags, mobile friendliness, Google algorithms and beyond &mdash; are only valuable insofar as they help you achieve the goal of having a human conversation with other humans.</p><h3> Embracing the Heart of Marketing</h3><p> Human marketing that meets the Internet&rsquo;s technical standards for SEO is the ultimate goal. Prioritizing one of these things over the other by focusing only on communication or only on SEO will damage your message and your results.</p><p> At the end of the day, the purpose of your online presence is to connect with your customers on a personal level so that they trust that doing business with you is in their best interest. The right copy and the right graphics communicate that unique brand offering and help customers make that decision. If you ignore the human side of marketing communications, your message will fall flat when customers arrive at your website.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-16 15:37:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-16 15:37:37.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_pCwb4bN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-being-human-with-your-marketing-a-look-at-the-how-and-why/\", \"post_id\": \"11823\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-16 15:37:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-16 15:37:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-being-human-with-your-marketing-a-look-at-the-how-and-why\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11822\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5762\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-You-Being-Human-With-Your-Marketing-A-Look-at-the-How-and-Why.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"374\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466175600,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}

Even during the world&rsquo;s worst recession when everyone was broke, people were buying everything that they sold. And their products are marginal. And why is it that despite every aspect of their family being a train wreck, they still have a TV show &ndash; and it&rsquo;s on its gazillionth season?</p><p> Well, here&rsquo;s why. Aside from being very attractive people (artificially or not, let&rsquo;s face it, they are great to look at which matters if you want people to pay attention to you), they are probably in the top 1% of salespeople. They&rsquo;re world class marketers. Just look at Kim. She has succeeded in breaking the Internet on more than one occasion (regardless of the classless way she did it, she did it), and she gets more than half the world on a daily basis to pay attention to her bottom. Men, women, everyone, they all fall for it.</p><p> If you look at how she dresses and how she acts, it&rsquo;s all about directing attention to her bottom. Her ability to captivate the world using that one body part has earned her more money than the US Treasury Department is printing.</p><p> Moreover, like all great sellers, they&rsquo;re able to put a positive spin on everything. Every single thing that happens in that family is a disaster, but yet we still tune in for the divorces, the gender changes, the fights. They&rsquo;re somehow able to make us intrigued and compel us to stay tuned for more.</p><p> Take this to heart, everyone, because it&rsquo;s showing you the way to massive wealth. You may not want to compromise your integrity like they have, but there is a lesson here. There is nothing more lucrative and more income-producing than being able to take your strengths, put a positive spin on whatever happens, and make the world want to watch. Make them intrigued, make them curious about some aspect of you that sets you apart. Make it so they can't ignore you.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s nothing more than that.</p><p> Hopefully this advice can help all of you pursuing more prosperity, whether you are starting a business or looking for a job.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-16 15:50:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-16 15:50:34.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_bzqzS60.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-lesson-to-learn-from-how-the-kardashians-produce-more-coin-than-the-u-s-mint/\", \"post_id\": \"11825\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-16 15:50:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-16 15:50:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-lesson-to-learn-from-how-the-kardashians-produce-more-coin-than-the-u-s-mint\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11824\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5763\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/A-Lesson-to-Learn-From-How-the-Kardashians-Produce-More-Coin-than-the-US-Mint.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"694\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466186400,"author_id":424,"chart_url":""}

We no longer need to wait until we get back to our home or office to make a call, look something up online or send an email. Smartphones, as well as tablets and laptops, have made all of this possible anytime. But here&rsquo;s the rub, just because you can use your digital device anytime and anywhere doesn&rsquo;t mean you should.</p><p> A friend of mine was at the gym working out on a cardio machine with headphones on enjoying her peaceful workout when she heard someone talking VERY LOUDLY. She looked around and noticed it was a young woman talking on her phone while also on a cardio machine. My friend pointed out to this young woman that she was disturbing other people. The talker said, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s my mom,&rdquo; as if that justified the disturbance. After a few back and forth exchanges, the young woman eventually took her call away from others and returned when she was done.</p><p> What&rsquo;s wrong with this scenario? Well, to start with, I&rsquo;m assuming the young lady was at the gym to work out, not talk on the phone. She can do that any of the remaining 23 hours in the day when she&rsquo;s not trying to get her daily burn. Secondly, others are at the gym to exercise, not listen to someone talk on the phone.</p><p> Here are some other times you absolutely should not use your phone:</p><li> First, even second, third and fourth dates. Your date will probably not want to go out with you again if you find your phone more important than him or her.</li><li> Weddings and Funerals. You&rsquo;re there to mourn the deceased or celebrate the betrothed, not check Facebook, or post photos of the event to Facebook. These are important events; give them the attention they deserve.</li><li> Movie theaters and playhouses. That bright light is a total bummer. Really, it is.</li><li> Job interviews. Need I say more? Apparently I do, because I&rsquo;ve heard more than once about people answering or looking at their phones in interviews. Guess what? They didn&rsquo;t get the job.</li><li> Meetings with your boss: unless your boss is mute and prefers communicating via text.</li><li> Client presentations. You can kiss that contract bye bye.</li><li> In the bathroom.

Today,  Apple expects the lifecycle for an average iPhone to be just three.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"863\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Shelf-Life.jpg\" width=\"639\"/></p><p> Firstly &ndash; this is almost certainly a rose tinted view of the past.  I remember several breakdowns and days of hand washing in our house. Statistics back me up &ndash; In 1971 Which? found that 50% of washing machines broke down in their first year. Today the chances of a breakdown in six years is just 12%.</p><p> Secondly &ndash; the relative cost of technology has fallen dramatically. In 1970, the cost of a washing machine was extortionate &ndash; equal to about 8% of average annual earnings. Today it&rsquo;s barely 1.5%. </p><p> In truth &ndash; today&rsquo;s goods are far cheaper and far more reliable than they ever were before.</p><p> The price we pay for this innovation is a much shortened lifecycle. And it&rsquo;s known as planned obsolescence.</p><p> This is a strategy in which the process of becoming obsolete&mdash; unfashionable or no longer usable &ndash; is planned and built into it from conception.</p><p> Many see planned obsolescence as a driver for innovation. Philip Kotler has described it as, \"the working of the competitive and technological forces in a free society&mdash;forces that lead to ever-improving goods and services.\"</p><p> Others regard is an exploitation of customers &ndash; driving them through a never ending cycle of wasteful upgrade or repurchase.</p><p> However &ndash; I propose that it has a place. And that includes a role in how we design our organisations and how we design our public services.</p><p> One of the questions I often hear asked is why aren&rsquo;t our organisations embracing change, new technology, social innovation, more quickly.</p><p> The answer is pretty simple I think: Getting rid of the old is harder than embracing the new.</p><p> All the talk and excitement of sexy new tech and ways of working runs out of steam when faced with legacy systems, established practices and policies. All formed in a very different age and stuck in place like a limpet on a rock.</p><p> Whilst organisations are generally very good at coming up with new ideas and practices they are generally not so skilled at decommissioning older ones.</p><li> So what if we designed all new services and products with the life cycle of an iPhone?</li><li> What if our customers and colleagues knew at the launch of a service that the infrastructure was in place for just four years , after which a newer , more powerful upgrade was to be launched?</li><li> What if rather than plan on our services being around forever , we designed for the very conditions in which they would cease to exist?</li><p> Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a better future than yet more failed attempts by services to fix society? </p><p> Over the next few months Bromford will be launching a completely re-engineered way of providing our core service. In fact it&rsquo;s less a service and more a relationship. A relationship less about housing and more about people.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the result of all the testing, piloting and exploring we&rsquo;ve been doing over the past few years. The learning from all these pilots has brought us to an overriding conclusion: we can have the most impact with our customers when we truly get to know them and are freed from the shackles of how we used to do things. </p><p> This redesign will be accompanied by a process of decommissioning. And we&rsquo;ll have dates by which we will know whether objectives have been achieved. Dates when we can begin again or decide we are no longer needed in the same way. Or even at all.</p><p> If we all planned for obsolescence we&rsquo;d perhaps see a very different social sector. A sector where innovation wasn&rsquo;t endlessly lauded so much as endlessly practiced.</p><p> A sector where things maybe didn&rsquo;t last so long , but where services had more impact, were cheaper, and rarely broke down like they used to.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-16 16:10:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-16 16:10:14.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_0mW3cZU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/to-boost-innovation-we-need-to-make-ourselves-obsolete/\", \"post_id\": \"11830\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-16 16:10:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-16 16:10:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"to-boost-innovation-we-need-to-make-ourselves-obsolete\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11828\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5765\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/To-Boost-Innovation-We-Need-to-Make-Ourselves-Obsolete.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"619\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466154000,"author_id":383,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5539,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Gig Economy is on the Rise: Is it the Future of the Labour Market?","link":"the-gig-economy-is-on-the-rise-is-it-the-future-of-the-labour-market","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In this second edition of &lsquo;hot or not&rsquo; I&rsquo;m discussing the gig economy. I was triggered by a few articles I stumbled upon last week. Although gig economy and portfolio working is still immature, it could be the future of labour market. Technology is empowering an on demand talent market, the millennial generation is leaving behind the nine-to-five workday and financial pressure is causing organisations to think differently about resource allocation. An interesting development I find both promising and challenging at the same time for the future of the labour market and HR.</p><p> These days people tend to change jobs at least several times throughout their working lives. The gig economy seems to be evoluating from this trend. It would result in a changing workforce  composite and organisational culture. This shift is mainly stimulating a skill-oriented market. It would enable organisations to procure the expertise needed for single projects or tasks.</p><p> The definition of the gig economy seems to vary. So let me first quote a definition I think is closest to the truth:</p><p> &ldquo;A gig economy is an environment in which temporary positions are common and organisations contract with independent workers for short-term engagements.&rdquo;</p><p> Technology and digitisation play a huge role in the shifting within the cultural and business environment. Digitisation has contributed to a decrease in certain jobs, but is also creating new ones. Robotics is another technology development that is encouraging shifts along the same lines. Technology enables employees to focus and improves communication and collaboration. Aspects the millennial generation became familiar with while growing up in this technology era. This is blurring the lines of employment.</p><p> PWC&rsquo;s My life, connected report suggests that, while technology is definitely contributing to the connectivity trend, it is also being driven by the eagerness of people to take more control over their lives, including their careers. In my opinion, this is exactly the ripple effect that millennials are taking the lead in, infecting other generations at the same time. The advantages of flexibility are also very alluring to older generations as work-life balance is becoming more important.</p><p> Although portfolio working is a growing hiring trend, many organisations have yet to see the value of employing people in this way and are therefore reluctant in deploying the right HR tech tools. It&rsquo;s often called the &ldquo;Uberfication&rdquo; of work, referring to the application of easy-to-use technologies in traditional marketplaces that is causing disruption. This has happened for example in the taxi industry by Uber and in the hotel business by Airbnb. The labour market, HR and recruitment will also be disrupted at some point. The question is not when (soon!), but how. Although technology and connectivity are the huge efficiency factors, the influence of gig workers is not to be sneezed at. Creating an alumni network encouraging former talents to share their new-found skills in future could prove much more fruitful.</p><p> How can organisations get each job or task done by the most qualified talent? The gig economy could be the answer.</p><p> What do you think? Gig economy, hot or not?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-16 16:20:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-16 16:20:00.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_ORpxFkU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-gig-economy-is-on-the-rise-is-it-the-future-of-the-labour-market/\", \"post_id\": \"11832\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-16 16:20:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-16 16:20:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-gig-economy-is-on-the-rise-is-it-the-future-of-the-labour-market\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11831\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5766\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Gig-Economy-is-on-the-Rise-Is-it-the-Future-of-the-Labour-Market.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"881\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466182800,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5540,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When Flying Blind Works: How to Succinctly Define How You Can Help Clients","link":"when-flying-blind-works-how-to-succinctly-define-how-you-can-help-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Joel Pierce was an experienced flight instructor, having been on countless outings with student pilots. But this trip was different. This pilot, Jim Platzer, was a life-long flying enthusiast who had first earned his pilot&rsquo;s license at age 21, but he had not seen the inside of a plane in over a decade. He was enjoying flying again, controlling the plane, doing everything flawlessly. As they approached the landing, Joel began providing Jim more direct feedback, letting him know exactly what he thought and commenting on Jim&rsquo;s responses. The landing was perfect, just as Jim had pictured it. Climbing out of the plane, Jim was thrilled and thanked Joel for his guidance. When Jim got out of the plane, he was reunited with his great friend, Mica. What made this flight different is that Jim is blind and Mica is his seeing-eye dog.</p><p> Having lost his sight over a decade ago due to a degenerative eye disease, Jim is determined to live enjoying what he can do rather than focusing on his limitations. Jim knew how to fly, but he understood he had to trust Joel&rsquo;s expertise. Joel&rsquo;s role was to see, interpret, and navigate what Jim could not perceive on his own, and Jim understood he needed to closely follow Joel&rsquo;s instructions to successfully achieve his objective.</p><p> As financial advisors we may long for clients who trust us as much as Joel&rsquo;s pilot, Jim, trusted him. What are you doing to help your clients understand your role and their need to trust you and closely follow your instructions so they can successfully achieve their financial goals?</p><p> When it comes to their money, many clients are understandably very protective. They want to feel in control. From the beginning of your relationship with clients, you need to be comfortable clearly articulating that while you are on this journey to protect and grow their assets together, your position means you can see all kinds of conditions, from potential economic headwinds, to market turbulence, to changing political landscapes, which they may be blind to, but which could impact their portfolio returns.</p><p> Your role in becoming their trusted advisor, means they need to be willing to listen to, respect, and follow your advice. Your conversation might go something like this:</p><p> &ldquo;When it comes to your personal plans and family finances, I take them seriously. It&rsquo;s an honor and huge responsibility to be permitted to have influence in people&rsquo;s lives. I work with clients who, 99% of the time, do exactly what I advise.</p><p> &ldquo;Often I meet people who are concerned about reaching their financial goals, such as funding college expenses or having enough to retire comfortably. Ultimately you&rsquo;ll have the wheel in our relationship, but I&rsquo;ll be doing the majority of the navigating. Often people want to know if they&rsquo;re on the correct path to reach their objectives, and if not, how to get on it as soon as possible. We head toward that final destination together, and I try and make your landing as smooth as possible.&rdquo;</p><p> If a prospect wants a broker to simply take their orders, rather than a trusted advisor, consider that an online brokerage account is likely a better fit, no matter what the value of their assets.</p><p> When prospects ask who is your ideal client, don&rsquo;t be afraid to communicate that you work with people who listen to you.</p><li> Be clear and honest about who you want to build relationships with: &ldquo;While I often work with people who have in excess of $___ (fill in the blank for assets), more importantly, I work with people who follow my advice so they can continue doing what matters most to them.&rdquo;</li><li> Be clear and provide examples about who fits your business: &ldquo;While I work with select people who have smaller balances, I do so because we really connect and they&rsquo;re a great fit with the way I work. They&rsquo;re clear about their goals and follow my advice. Likewise, I&rsquo;ve had some larger clients whom I stopped working with because they consistently wouldn&rsquo;t take my advice, yet expected to absorb a lot of my time. In situations like that, the relationship just is not a great fit for either of us.&rdquo;</li><li> Be clear and finish strongly, clearly laying out expectations and next steps: &ldquo;From the concerns and priorities you&rsquo;ve mentioned, and from the questions you&rsquo;ve asked, I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;d enjoy working with you and helping you achieve your objectives. You need to decide if you&rsquo;re comfortable working with me. From what you&rsquo;ve mentioned, it seems like you are. If you&rsquo;d like to move forward with me, I can walk you through the next steps. How does that sound?&rdquo;</li><p> Most people are overwhelmingly busy these days. Do yourself and your prospects a favor by not hesitating to clearly and succinctly define who and how you help. The sooner you do, the sooner you can begin a new, profitable relationship &ndash; either with that person, or the next ideal client who comes your way.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-16 16:33:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-16 16:33:51.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_kOk7xZv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-flying-blind-works-how-to-succinctly-define-how-you-can-help-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"11834\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-16 16:33:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-16 16:33:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-flying-blind-works-how-to-succinctly-define-how-you-can-help-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11833\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5767\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/When-Flying-Blind-Works-How-to-Succinctly-Define-How-You-Can-Help-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"736\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466168400,"author_id":378,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5543,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"National Minimum Wage: The \"Fight for $15\"","link":"national-minimum-wage-the-fight-for-15","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The \"Fight For $15\" is gaining national attention and becoming an issue in the presidential race. Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have expressed strong support for a national minimum wage of $15, more than double the current $7.25.</p><p> Missing in the national debate over the minimum wage is the recognition that taxes and living costs vary enormously from state to state. The dollar amount of the hourly wage in any given state isn&rsquo;t as important as what workers have left after paying taxes and living expenses. A $15 hourly wage in a state with high taxes and a high cost of living is hardly equal to the same $15 hourly wage in a state with low taxes and a low cost of living.</p><p> To compare the purchasing power of a $15 minimum wage, I adjusted the wage for state and local taxes and for the cost of living, using data from the  <u>  Council for Community and Economic Research </u>  as presented by the  <u>  Missouri Economic Research and Information Center </u> . (You can see the complete rankings with and without adjustments at <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings </a> .)</p><p> I selected Washington DC as my base location for comparison, as it has the second highest cost of living in the US behind Hawaii. Washington DC is also representative of the cost of living and taxes in many major metropolitan areas, where the drive for a $15 minimum wage seems strongest.</p><p> What I found was that location makes a huge difference. For example, the cost of living (COL) in Washington DC is 147.6% of the national average, with state and local taxes costing 9.6% of income. Mississippi's COL is 84.3% of the national average, with state and local taxes costing 8.4%. After adjusting for cost of living and taxes, the purchasing power of a worker earning $15.00 an hour in Washington DC equals that of a worker earning $8.46 an hour in Mississippi. In South Dakota, a worker earning $9.67 an hour has the same purchasing power as one earning $15.00 an hour in Washington DC.</p><p> Conversely, a worker earning $15 an hour in Mississippi would have to earn $26.60 an hour in Washington DC to have the same purchasing power. For a South Dakota worker, $15 an hour has the same purchasing power as $22.66 an hour in DC. Mandating that employers in Mississippi pay $15 an hour would be equal to forcing employers in DC to pay $26.60 an hour.</p><p> Clearly, while a $15 minimum wage may be reasonable in Washington DC, a flat $15 national minimum wage is incredibly unfair, as it does not take into consideration local variations in COL and taxes. Currently, 51.1 million workers earn less than $15 an hour. Forcing rural small businesses to raise wages as high as an equivalent wage in DC of $26.60 will cost many employees their jobs and raise costs for everyone.</p><p> The money to double many worker&rsquo;s wages wouldn't simply come out of profits, as many businesses don&rsquo;t have enough profit to absorb the increased costs. Nor would it realistically come from just raising prices. Higher prices would carry a double whammy: both negating the raise many just got and meaning fewer consumers would choose to purchase the product or service.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Instead, a $15 national minimum wage would make jobs even harder to get, as employers would necessarily need to streamline, outsource, and hire only the most talented workers.</p><p> A federal minimum wage is a floor, not a ceiling. Of necessity, it needs to accommodate the states with the lowest cost of living. States need to remain free to set their own minimum wages according to the needs of their own workers.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 13:35:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 13:35:53.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_eXWndOW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/national-minimum-wage-the-fight-for-15/\", \"post_id\": \"11840\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 13:35:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 13:35:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"national-minimum-wage-the-fight-for-15\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11839\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5770\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/National-Minimum-Wage-The-Fight-for-15.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"729\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466431200,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5544,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Things You Can Learn From John Oliver About Retirement Planning","link":"4-things-you-can-learn-from-john-oliver-about-retirement-planning","source_link":null,"content":"<p> On his HBO show  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZSpET11ZY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Last Week Tonigh </a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZSpET11ZY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  t </a> , comedian John Oliver recently turned the national spotlight on the wealth management and retirement planning industry. In light of a new Department of Labor rule requiring all financial advisors to act as fiduciaries for retirement accounts,  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  in which we strongly believe </a> , Oliver skewered the opaque tendencies of brokers and traditional financial advisors. He urges viewers to bring their business to a transparent fiduciary who has your best interest at heart.Oliver&rsquo;s segment serves an important purpose &mdash; many regular people who trust a traditional financial advisor with their money, or millennials who are just now beginning to think about retirement planning, simply don&rsquo;t know the many ways the advisor could be robbing them of their hard-earned money. While not everyone is as clueless as the woman whom Oliver ridicules for asking CNBC host Suze Orman whether she should spend $4,000 to get an elf-spotting certification in Iceland, the many ways traditional financial advisors hurt their clients are often hidden unless the client does the digging themselves. With that in mind, here are four major takeaways from Oliver&rsquo;s monologue.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Many financial advisors may not have your best interest at heart &mdash; but you can find one who does. </strong></h3>As Oliver notes, &ldquo;financial advisor&rdquo; is a vague term. Even so, many traditional financial advisors  are not fiduciaries, and instead operate on commission. (<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> An advisor who is a fiduciary</a> must always act in the best interests of you, the client.) This means they can execute trades and strategies that line their own pockets with little regard for your financial well-being. We believe that this is unacceptable; as a result, we operate as a fee-only fiduciary that does not receive any sort of commission. While some advisors make money by endorsing a particular investment or product to their clients, we are paid only by our clients.<h3> <strong>  2. The &ldquo;active management&rdquo; of many funds and advisors can destroy your capital. </strong></h3>As we&rsquo;ve previously detailed <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> in this blog</a>, you shouldn&rsquo;t expect to win with actively managed funds. Not only do these funds fail to outperform the market, but in doing so they also accrue massive fees due to the large amount of trades they are making. While compound interest grows your investment over time, interest isn&rsquo;t the only thing that compounds &mdash; fees do as well. Oliver cites a study in which an index of stocks, selected by a cat throwing a ball at them, outperformed an actively managed fund overseen by experts. The cat earned returns of 7%, while the pros garnered only 3.5%. Oliver summarizes the situation succinctly: &ldquo;If you stick around doing nothing while everyone else around you [messes] up, you&rsquo;re going to win big.&rdquo; At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe sticking with <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-philosophy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> investments that focus on low cost and tax efficiency</a> is the best way to save for the long term. ETFs are an investment vehicle that we utilize to accomplish this goal.<h3> <strong>  3. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this complicated, and it might be getting simpler. </strong></h3>There are easy steps you can take. Start saving now &mdash; it&rsquo;s never too early. When screening financial advisors, ask if they are fiduciaries. With your money in the hands of a fiduciary who puts your best interest first, you can be confident in your advisor&rsquo;s motivations.Feel like the little guy/girl who can&rsquo;t get the time of day from your &ldquo;financial advisor&rdquo;? Read our post &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Why Go Where Your Money&rsquo;s Not Wanted?</a>##TRENDING##<h3> <strong>  4. These principles aren&rsquo;t abstract &mdash; they have real consequences for real people, like you. </strong></h3>To demonstrate all of this, Oliver examined the 401k his own employees at HBO were using through their provider. The retirement fund charged 1.69% fees, and their broker refused to offer low-cost, low-fee plans. The advisor even messed up the calculations on the compounding interest, making his original math off by over $10,000,000. These are not the actions of someone who values his/her clients more than a paycheck; on the other hand, we value our partnership in our clients&rsquo; future success.Where Oliver went wrong is when he questioned why anyone would invite their financial advisor to their wedding. We are proof that a relationship like that is possible between client and advisor. As a fiduciary, when we consistently act in the best interests of our clients, we end up building strong friendships with them.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 13:42:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 13:42:26.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_c4SuS0k.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-things-you-can-learn-from-john-oliver-about-retirement-planning/\", \"post_id\": \"11842\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 13:42:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 13:42:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-things-you-can-learn-from-john-oliver-about-retirement-planning\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11841\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5771\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"574\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466413200,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

So you needn&rsquo;t fear outsourcing some of these tasks to an SEO consultant or company.</p><p> For more than a decade,  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/search-engine-optimization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mod Girl&rsquo;s SEO consultants </a>  have helped businesses secure thousands of first page results. Unlike big firms that apply a one-size-fits-all strategy, we build customized packages with only the services you absolutely need for a highly personalized level of service.</p><h3> Here are eight ways a Google SEO Consultant can help you rock your business presence online:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. SEO Audit</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Answers: How can our site improve ranking? What are we doing right? What are we doing wrong? </strong></p><p> Our SEO audit service delivers a report that shows your top competitors and how your site&rsquo;s main pages stack up to theirs. We let you know on-site and off-site factors affecting your search rankings and assess how easy it is for your key demographics to find your business online. All metrics are easily digestible and actionable to help you plan your next moves and prioritize a list of short and long term goals.</p><h3> 2. SEO Strategy Session</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Answers: Where is your SEO budget best spent to get the maximum impact for the money? </strong></p><p> Most companies have some money set aside for search marketing, but aren&rsquo;t conducting the in-depth research necessary to know where they&rsquo;ve been and where they should be heading. Our Google SEO consultants dig deep to discover what tactics deliver the most sales to your doorstep and what ailing strategies should be packed up on the shelf. We create a list of steps and a manageable SEO calendar to set a winning plan in motion.  <strong>     </strong></p><h3> 3. SEO Training</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Answers: How do I accomplish certain tasks to optimize my presence in Google search results? </strong></p><p> As  <a href=\"http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2389642/2015-guide-to-free-seo-training-courses-online\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Search Engine Watch </a>  states, there are many worthwhile free SEO training courses online. However, for the busy entrepreneur or marketer, there&rsquo;s often not enough hours in the day to invest. Most people we talk to prefer a more  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/one-to-one/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  one-on-one coaching </a>  type experience where they can have all their questions answered and learn at their own pace anyhow. We can help you learn the ins and outs of  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/web-analytics-consulting-services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Google Analytics </a>  or other SEO software, run a checklist to assess website performance and set up monitoring tools, conduct smarter keyword research and set up PPC accounts,  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/google-answer-box-optimization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  write better SEO content </a> , adapt your SEO strategy to a new Google algorithm update, and so much more.</p><h3> 4. SEO Keyword Research &amp; Analysis</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Answers: What are people typing into Google to find businesses like mine? Which terms convert? </strong></p><p> When your site contains the right keywords that correspond with your target market, the search engines will bring potential customers and ready-to-buy consumers to your website. Of course, many businesses are competing over some of the same keywords, so it takes a good deal of research to discover &ldquo;the sweet spot.&rdquo; We conduct a thorough analysis of your existing strategy to build upon what&rsquo;s working, cut out what&rsquo;s not, and identify opportunities for noticeable growth over the next six months.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/keyword-research.png\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/infographic-how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-134202\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SearchEngineLand.com </a></p><h3> 5. SEO Content Development</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Answers: How do I write more compelling content that search engines will pick up and promote? </strong></p><p> In the past, all it took to create &ldquo;good content&rdquo; was some keyword analysis and including these relevant search terms in your title, headlines, first sentence and last sentence. If you were really ahead of your time, you&rsquo;d include the term in your image meta-tags and on dedicated internal site pages, too. After many Google algorithm updates, these old strategies aren&rsquo;t working like they used to. There is still a place to season your writing with the occasional keyword here and there, but by and large, the best results come from researching excellent topics, filling out your posts with enough &ldquo;meat and potatoes,&rdquo; and strategically promoting your content across channels and through social bookmarking avenues. Our consultants will help your team create a better editorial calendar for the year&rsquo;s content or we can unleash our team of  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  copywriters and marketers </a>  on your project to deliver original, ready-to-roll content to you.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 6. SEO Competitive Analysis &amp; Industry Advice</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Answers: Who are our main competitors and how do we compare? </strong></p><p> Moz lists competitive analysis as &ldquo;one of the most important activities for any SEO process.&rdquo; Our analysis will help you understand what top search terms your competitors are ranking for that you&rsquo;re missing out on, as well as areas where you&rsquo;re far surpassing them. We&rsquo;ll also uncover sources of traffic that you and your competitors have missed and outline strategies to harness new opportunities to gain more market share. Often, a few simple tweaks to your website and Google campaigns can go a long way. Our highly specialized SEO consultants also have relevant work experience in  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/clients/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  several key industries </a>  that we know inside and out to offer better advice than you&rsquo;d get from the typical SEO company.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/seo-competitive-analysis.jpg\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/illustrated-seo-competitive-analysis-workflow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Moz.com </a></p><h3> 7. SEO Technical Advice</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Answers: What new tools and technologies will help people find your business online? </strong></p><p> It can be challenging to keep up with all the new SEO tools at your disposal. There are many free tools out there, but also some paid tools you may be curious about. Are they worth the money? Will they save you time and effort or bring in that much more traffic? Furthermore, you may be needing advice on how to best approach topics like setting up 404 redirects, choosing the right hosting provider, what to do about error pages, or whether your code is clean enough. There are many back-end issues affecting your search visibility. A Google SEO consultant will help you navigate these murky channels and sail ahead toward better results.</p><h3> 8. SEO Implementation &amp; Monitoring</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Answers: How can we do everything that needs to be done and run a more efficient SEO machine? </strong></p><p> At the end of the day, many of our SEO consulting clients realize they don&rsquo;t have the time or manpower to do everything they want to do to remain competitive in Search. When this happens, we let them know about the many other services we provide from copywriting to  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/digital-advertising/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  PPC management </a>  to  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/marketing-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  marketing automation </a> . We&rsquo;re willing to take just about any marketing task off your plate to help make life easier. And, because we&rsquo;ve conducted in-depth research and analysis and taken the time to get to know your business, our strategic marketing partnership becomes even more invaluable, as we act as a seamless extension of your existing marketing department.</p><h3> Want to learn more about Mod Girl&rsquo;s Google SEO Consultants?</h3><p> <br/> From on-page to off-page SEO, Mod Girl&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/search-engine-optimization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  holistic SEO consulting services </a>  focuses on providing smarter content and improving user experience through technical SEO.

{"original_id":5546,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Can Divorce Affect Your Credit Score?","link":"how-can-divorce-affect-your-credit-score","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Divorce can have a big impact on your personal life, but with the proper planning, you can minimize its effects on your financial life. Even if you maintained separate accounts during your relationship, certain credit ramifications can come with ending a marriage.</p><p> While your credit score won&rsquo;t take a hit simply because you filed for divorce, there are ways your credit can be affected.</p><h3> Your income may decrease</h3><p> <br/> Losing one of two household incomes&mdash;and shifting from one to two residences&mdash;can cause financial strain. Financial implications are even more impactful if one spouse hasn&rsquo;t been working outside of the home.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very tough for most people going through a divorce to make ends meet exactly as they had when there was only one household living off a pot of income rather than two households living off of the same amount of income,&rdquo; says Lili Vasileff, president of Divorce and Money Matters, LLC. You might have to make some considerable life changes to reduce living expenses to live on one income, especially if that income significantly lowers the amount of credit for which you qualify. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Vasileff believes it&rsquo;s important to create a budget, prioritize your debt and expenses, and keep up with payments that directly impact your credit score. Keep in mind that one recent 30-day late bill payment, if reported by the lender, can negatively impact your credit score by as much as a 110-point drop in score for up to seven years. </strong></p><h3> Separate joint accounts</h3><p> <br/> Missed payments on joint accounts that are in your name and your spouse&rsquo;s, including your mortgage, cosigned loans and joint credit cards can impact both of your credit scores.</p><p> Even if your divorce decree notes that your former spouse has agreed to take on some debt from your joint accounts, you are still legally liable. Creditors aren&rsquo;t bound by divorce decrees, so they could hold you responsible if your spouse fails to make payments.</p><p> &ldquo;Credit cards and missed or late mortgage payments are where I really see credit scores start to sink,&rdquo; says Michelle Nocito, a certified divorce financial analyst. &ldquo;Especially if the parties are in disagreement and communication is low.&rdquo;</p><p> You can, however, separate joint accounts by closing them and reopening new accounts in your name. Before doing so, make sure all balances have been paid on time and in full. You can also work with your creditors to separate the debt and re-establish joint accounts in one spouse&rsquo;s name only. This would convert your joint accounts into individual ones. If possible, separate as many accounts as you can before your divorce is finalized.</p><p> &ldquo;People&rsquo;s emotional temperatures are very high during a divorce,&rdquo; Nocito says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen couples separate and [then] out of spite, one party will run up the credit cards.&rdquo;</p><h3> Build your credit</h3><p> <br/> The good news is that when it comes to credit, you can always get a fresh start.</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to establish your own individual credit identity as quickly as possible,&rdquo; Vasileff says. &ldquo;Get a major credit card, open a bank account, finance a new car purchase, or take out a new line of credit. You don&rsquo;t have to borrow against it, but it&rsquo;s important to be approved for credit and get it started.&rdquo;</p><p> Don&rsquo;t wait until you need credit to build it, Nocito says. Simply being granted new credit is considered a positive sign to the three national credit reporting agencies, provided you open new lines of credit slowly over time, rather than logging multiple requests in a short period.</p><h3> Check your credit report</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s also important to review your credit report from the three credit reporting agencies at least annually. If possible, ask your spouse to do the same. This will help you spot and settle any financial disputes or errors before the divorce is final.</p><p> <strong>  One of Vasileff&rsquo;s clients had no idea her husband had taken out a second home equity line on the house in both of their names until she pulled her credit report. Vasileff believes the most important tip for people going through a divorce is to &ldquo;know your finances.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce or soon will be, protecting (and, if necessary) rebuilding your credit takes effort and time, but it&rsquo;s not impossible. However, Nocito says, ignoring your financial obligations could have a lasting impact and stay with you long after the marriage is over.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 14:07:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 14:07:02.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_rrpLi7T.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-can-divorce-affect-your-credit-score/\", \"post_id\": \"11846\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 14:07:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 14:07:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-can-divorce-affect-your-credit-score\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11845\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5773\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-Can-Divorce-Affect-Your-Credit-Score_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"539\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466416800,"author_id":307,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5547,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Investors: Past Mistakes Do Not Guarantee Future Results","link":"investors-past-mistakes-do-not-guarantee-future-results","source_link":null,"content":"<p> But here&rsquo;s the rub &ndash; how many investors actually learn from their past mistakes? How many don&rsquo;t realize that their bad decisions come from ingrained behavioral biases? If you don&rsquo;t know you have  <a href=\"https://financialdna.com/behavioral-biases/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  behavioral biases </a> , then keep on keeping on making poor decisions. Because what you don&rsquo;t know, is what&rsquo;s hurting you.Behaviorally Smart investors know their propensity for rushing through their natural behavior when under pressure. They&rsquo;re keenly aware of their knee-jerk reaction to unsteady markets or the latest, greatest bandwagon opportunity. They know the danger in not taking a breath &ndash;  <a href=\"http://financialdna.com/investor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  to check themselves before they wreck themselves  </a> - or seek outside counsel before deciding on a major investment opportunity. Conversely, investors who do not have this insight will continue to get into trouble and make bad decisions.When investors allow emotions to invade investment decisions, they&rsquo;re set to fail. However, developing an understanding of how we inherently react to market volatility or investment opportunities will lead to becoming a Behaviorally Smart decision maker.In his book, Behaviorally Smart Financial Planning, Hugh Massie makes the following observation:Very often, without a heightened level of personal awareness, investor&rsquo;s blind-spots can lead to investing behavior that results in sub-par outcomes. He continues by explaining the two levels of distinctive thinking which drive:How the mind works inherently in its natural state to instinctively make financial decisions based on natural DNA &ldquo;hard-wiring&rdquo;. This behavior reflects the automatic biases which consistently reveal themselves throughout life (&ldquo;System 1&Prime;)How the conscious thinking evolved through circumstances, experiences, education and values situationally influence financial preferences at different times in the course of life. This is learned behavior which generally reveals itself as a result of behavioral management (&ldquo;System 2&Prime;).Emotion and psychology affect every decision we make and investing is no different. It&rsquo;s true to say that most investors revel in the process of creating wealth, but pay little or no attention to managing it or themselves. Without understanding behavioral biases, investing becomes a lottery and any gains are held for ransom by the investor&rsquo;s own ignorance.Don&rsquo;t allow blind spots in your own behavior to highjack important decisions you will make in life. Change course by learning about your inherent behavioral biases and how to mitigate their affects on your decision-making capabilities.It&rsquo;s not rocket science &ndash; just four easy steps:</p><li> Step 1. Make the decision to educate yourself</li><li> Step 2. Use a validated, accurate and trustworthy process such as  <a href=\"http://financialdna.com/investor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Financial DNA </a>  to uncover your behavioral biases</li><li> Step 3. Select an advisor who not only has your best interests at heart but also has educated themselves about investor DNA and Behavioral Biases. Great advisors examine the reasons behind decisions their clients make.</li><li> Step 4. Always remember your natural, go to&rsquo; behavior when markets get rocky (as markets will).</li>In conclusion:<strong> &ldquo;Invest in as much of yourself as you can, you are your own biggest asset by far.&rdquo; Warren Buffet</strong><strong> &ldquo;The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.&rdquo; Bertrand Russell</strong>Duke University Professor and founder of The Center for Advanced Hindsight behavioral economist <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1713426\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Dan Ariely</a>. Predictably, irrational refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.&ldquo;Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same &ldquo;types&rdquo; of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They&rsquo;re systematic and predictable&ndash;making us &ldquo;predictably&rdquo; irrational.&rdquo;As investors the financial decisions we make can be both complex and stressful; they can change our financial long term security forever. Their impact can be life changing. This is why self-education and understanding decision-making approaches in terms of why and how we make decisions need to be top priorities.","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 14:17:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 14:17:52.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_v0dwHkT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/investors-past-mistakes-do-not-guarantee-future-results/\", \"post_id\": \"11848\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 14:17:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 14:17:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"investors-past-mistakes-do-not-guarantee-future-results\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11847\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5774\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Investors-Past-Mistakes-Do-Not-Guarantee-Future-Results.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"670\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466416800,"author_id":88,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5548,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"43 Twitter Tips and Treats for Financial Advisors","link":"43-twitter-tips-and-treats-for-financial-advisors","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Registered Investment Advisors and other modern financial advisors are using Twitter to grow their business. Herewith, 43 dos and don&rsquo;ts:</p><h3> Dos:</h3>1. <strong> Do have a social media strategy. </strong>Better to plan first rather than fly off in all directions at once.2. <strong> Do think of Twitter as a marathon</strong>, not a sprint.3. <strong> Do make Twitter a part of your overall marketing and social media strategy.</strong> If you have or are going to be a Twitterer, it should be a portion, not the only part of your overall marketing plan and social media strategy.4. <strong> Do build trust.</strong> As a financial advisor, you&rsquo;re looking to build trust and to engender a long-term relationships with your clients. Building trust takes time.5. <strong> Do use Twitter to drive traffic to your blog posts</strong>, and from there, to drive engagement and ultimately, to build those relationships into clients.6. <strong> Do &ldquo;Follow&rdquo; other people and organizations who fit your ideal client personas.</strong>7. <strong> Do &ldquo;Follow&rdquo; other RIA thought leaders</strong>, competitors, custodians, media, service providers &ndash; you may learn a few things along the way.8. <strong> Do reciprocate.</strong> When somebody follows you, and what they have to say is relevant to you, follow them back.9.<strong>  Do retweet.</strong> If a tweet fits your fancy, and you think your followers will find it informative, hit the retweet button.10. <strong> Do add a headline of your own to a retweet.</strong> It may take a few more minutes to actually read and understand the link you are reweeting, but by adding your  own headline, you also add your own spin.11. <strong> Do put a bird on it.</strong> Not a Twitter logo, but in the space allowed for a logo in your banner, best to showcase your logo, or if appropriate, your picture. In other words, don't be the default egg in some showcases.12. <strong> Do tweet often.</strong> What's the optimal amount of tweets to send out per day? Some RIAs and firms in the financial advisory business tweet once per day, some may do as many as five or six per day.13. <strong> Do use stats.</strong> Helpful numbers work. According to Neil Patel, founder of KISSMetrics among others, tweets with blog posts that contain stats and data received 149% more social shares than the average blog post.14. <strong> Do have a dedicated social media person or agency manage your Twitter account.</strong>Decide on a daily time budget, whether it&rsquo;s 10 minutes or one hour or day, and stick to it.15. <strong> Do inform and educate.</strong> Social media can educate potential clients and help position a firm as a thought leader.16. <strong> Do use images.</strong> Tweets with images simply get more: 150% more retweets, 89% more favorites, 8% more click-troughs. (Source: Jeff Bullas)17. <strong> Do use #hashtags.</strong> A #hashtag is a simple way to search for tweets &ndash; and to be found - about a common topic. If you tweet about retirement planning, then select a relevant hashtag, like #retirement planning,  #rollover, and/or #401K.18. <strong> Do try a newsjack.</strong> Let&rsquo;s say some movie with Star Wars in the title is opening. If you tie a tweet with Star Wars in your title, and your linked blog post is about the Luke Skywalkers of financial advisors, then you may increase your visibility as well.19. <strong> Do archive all or your posts.</strong> Do you want to be in compliance? Make sure all social media posts across all platforms are preserved, it&rsquo;s required by FINRA.20. <strong> Do treat Twitter like any other form of advertising.</strong> Before clicking the &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; button, make sure that all posts are properly reviewed for regulatory compliance.21. <strong> Do have written procedures and policies.</strong> Procedures should be put into place to keep records, review content, and specifically address the use of social media at the firm and individual account level(s).22. <strong> Do be aware of cyber security.</strong> Do not share sensitive personal or employee details that could facilitate a social engineering hack.23. <strong> Do generate content worth following.</strong> Twitter does not allow you to follow 2,000 or more people or companies unless you have at least 1,900 followers.24. <strong> Do keep it short.</strong> You have 140 characters to work with, but shorter is often better. According to Social Media Examiner, shorter tweets see 17% more engagement.<h3> Don&rsquo;ts</h3>25. <strong> Don't expect immediate results.</strong> Budget months or longer to steadily build up an audience.26. <strong> Don&rsquo;t ignore the baby boomer generation.</strong> According to HubSpot, 22% of all Twitter users were 50 years old or older. (As of 2015, 12% were between 50 and 64 years old; and 10% were 65 or older.27. <strong> Don't tweet late at night.</strong> If you want to be followed by people and companies who fit your profile, they are likely sleeping at 2AM. They won&rsquo;t see your tweet &ndash; it will be covered up by the latest and greatest from others.28. <strong> Don&rsquo;t use broken links.</strong> Before you click the Tweet button, check to see if the link you are linking to actually links.29. <strong> Don't forget to tweet on the weekends.</strong> Although B2C engagement was highest on weekends and Wednesdays, B2B engagement was 14% higher on weekdays than weekends (Source: HubSpot.)30. <strong> Don&rsquo;t use client testimonials.</strong> The testimonial rule commonly referred as to Rule 206(4)-1(a)(1) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 also applies to social media.31. <strong> Don&rsquo;t mislead.</strong> Never post guarantees or anything that could be construed by a reader to be false or misleading.32. <strong> Don&rsquo;t direct message a new follower with a sales pitch five minutes after you they&rsquo;ve followed you.</strong>Or even 10 minutes. Wait a while. Set a spell. Or don't do it.33. <strong> Don't share overly personal information</strong> in a tweet or in a direct message to a follower.34. <strong> Don't send content that&rsquo;s of no interest to your targeted clientele.</strong>35. <strong> Don&rsquo;t allow followers to comment on your posts.</strong> Compliance alert: if you have enabled the ability to write comments, a client may post an inadvertent testimonial. As Chico Marx might say, &ldquo;That's a no good.&rdquo;36. <strong> Don&rsquo;t ask for unearned favors</strong>, like asking followers if the liked your latest blog post.37. <strong> Don&rsquo;t allow endorsements.</strong> FINRA may consider endorsements to be testimonials.38. <strong> Don't ignore the advance search function.</strong> By typing in keywords, financial advisors can potentially find prospective investors by demographics, interests, geography, and more.39. <strong> Don't use more then three hashtags in one tweet.</strong> Gets kind overwhelming, and your tweet may look more like gibberish than a sentence with meaning.40. <strong> Don't forget about mobile.</strong> Approximately 40% of all users use Twitter on their mobile device, so make sure that tweet images look good when shrunk to fit.41. <strong> Don't forget to use third party tools to organize campaigns.</strong>Hootsuite, Buffer, SocialOoomph and others provide ways to create an editorail calendar, publish to other social platforms simultaneously, and find likely new followers, among other features.42. <strong> Don't forget to say thank you.</strong> When somebody follows you, or retweets a tweet, send them a private thank you via the direct message button, or make it public and simply say thanks with a new tweet.43. <strong> Don&rsquo;t minimize the potential sales impact of Twitter.</strong> According to Putnam Investments, in their fourth annual survey of financial advisor social media use, 75% of all advisors had <a href=\"https://serebrinpartners.com/single-post/2015/12/10/Is-Social-Media-Worth-46-Million-in-Asset-Growth-for-RIAs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> gained assets</a> directly from a lead on social media. While your results will vary, of course, and past performance does not guarantee future results, the average advisor added $4.6 million in assets under management from a lead on social media.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 14:40:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 14:40:54.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_XCk2GIR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/43-twitter-tips-and-treats-for-financial-advisors/\", \"post_id\": \"11850\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 14:40:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 14:40:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"43-twitter-tips-and-treats-for-financial-advisors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11849\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5775\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/43-Twitter-Tips-and-Treats-for-Financial-Advisors.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"715\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466420400,"author_id":180,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5549,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Ways to Properly Give a Gift to Your Clients","link":"7-ways-to-properly-give-a-gift-to-your-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The After-Experience</h3><p> <br/> Congratulations to my buddy John Ruhlin who has a new book that just came out, Giftology. In this book he covers the art of the appreciation gift. You may be familiar with his name if you&rsquo;ve been following my work. I&rsquo;ve covered some of his ideas in the past. He&rsquo;s a rock star when it comes to understanding how to make people feel special and appreciated.</p><p> One way to make a customer feel appreciated is with a special gift. Now, keep in mind that some companies have policies that their employees are not allowed to receive gifts from customers over a certain amount when you are giving a customer a gift. If you are constrained by a low budget, from either the customer&rsquo;s policies or what you want to spend, remember that it is the thought that counts. With that I share with you seven ways to properly give a gift of appreciation to your customers.</p><li> <strong>  Personalize the gift. John sells some high-end kitchen knives. </strong> One of his favorite gifts is to give a big butcher knife with a personalized engraving on the blade. The one John gave me reads:  For the Hyken Home . Very classy!</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t put your logo on the gift. </strong> If it is a really special gift, the customer will always remember where it came from. There is a difference between a gift and a promotional item. Whenever I see the knife John gave us, I always think of him. I don&rsquo;t need to see his logo.</li><li> <strong>  Give a gift you know your customer will enjoy and appreciate. </strong> You don&rsquo;t want your gift to be put in a closet to collect dust. I just did a speech for a client who sent me a special thank you gift; an autographed hockey puck by one of the St. Louis Blues. He knows that I love hockey and my favorite team is the Blues. By the way, this gift is personal, doesn&rsquo;t have a logo and is displayed on the bookshelf in my office for everyone to see.</li><li> <strong>  If you want your gift to be truly memorable, consider something other than a consumable, also known as food. </strong> Now, I love chocolate and caramel popcorn, so maybe I don&rsquo;t 100% agree with this one, but I get John&rsquo;s point. Too many things can go wrong. There can be diet issues and someone may not like what you send them. And, it&rsquo;s gone in short time. (Chocolate doesn&rsquo;t last long in my office.)</li><li> <strong>  Consider what John refers to as the &ldquo;inner circle,&rdquo; </strong> which can include the customer&rsquo;s spouse, kids or even the customer&rsquo;s assistant, or someone else who he or she works with. It&rsquo;s nice to recognize and appreciate them as well. My wife loves the knife that John gave me&hellip; I mean  us .</li><li> <strong>  As we&rsquo;re talking about customers, don&rsquo;t forget about your   <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z27Y4IsGlV8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   internal customers  </a>  . </strong> A surprise gift or taking employees to lunch can go a long way in building stronger morale and engagement. Show the people you work with that you care.</li><li> <strong>  Consider giving a gift when it&rsquo;s least expected, instead of out of obligation. </strong> Everyone sends holiday cards and holiday gifts. I&rsquo;m not against that, but a gift that is given when it&rsquo;s least expected will stand out and be even more appreciated. <br/>  </li><p> In one of the books I wrote,  <a href=\"http://amazeeverycustomereverytime.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Amazement Revolution </a> , I talk about the  after-experience . The idea is to do something special for your customers that is unexpected, appreciated and memorable. So, surprise your customers with something that is thoughtful and personal. Something they will enjoy and appreciate.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 15:01:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 15:01:46.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_MbKROVJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-ways-to-properly-give-a-gift-to-your-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"11852\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 15:01:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 15:01:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-ways-to-properly-give-a-gift-to-your-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11851\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5776\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7-Ways-to-Properly-Give-a-Gift-to-Your-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"614\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466449200,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5550,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Beating the Fear Factor in Equity Markets","link":"beating-the-fear-factor-in-equity-markets","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Sharon E. Fay, CFA</p><p> Today&rsquo;s equity markets have all the makings of a scary movie. But don&rsquo;t look away. Embrace uncertainty and adjust expectations to regain conviction in equities as a source of long-term returns.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no shortage of worries for equity investors this year. January&rsquo;s spike in volatility has scarred the market. The global economic growth outlook is shaky amid China&rsquo;s slowdown. Stock valuations look full, and earnings are under pressure in a low-growth world. And there&rsquo;s growing concern that if Britain votes to leave the European Union on June 23, markets could take another hit. No matter what type of investor you are, it&rsquo;s hard to know how to proceed.</p><p> <b>  Adjusting Return Expectations </b></p><p> Start by adjusting expectations. After the global financial crisis, easy money policies from the major central banks fueled a multiyear rally in equities. As a result, valuations reached relatively high levels, particularly in the US, where the market&rsquo;s price/earnings ratio (P/E) was 16.7 at the end of May&mdash;higher than in 64% of all months since 1996. European P/Es are lower, though slightly above their long-term average. Emerging markets, however, are still attractively valued after five difficult years.</p><p> But looking at valuations in isolation is misleading. For perspective, it&rsquo;s important to assess the potential of equities in the coming years versus other investing options&mdash;and what&rsquo;s likely to drive returns.</p><p> Since the global financial crisis, investors have become accustomed to unusually strong equity returns, with the S&amp;P 500 advancing by an annualized 17.3% from 2011 through June 2015, driven by a recovery from a crash of historic proportions. But the recovery started to run out of steam last summer, and these returns aren&rsquo;t likely to continue.</p><p> At the same time, fixed-income returns are also likely to remain low. Our Capital Markets Engine, which projects 10,000 possible outcomes based on a variety of market conditions, expects the S&amp;P 500 to return an annualized 5.9% over the next five years ( <i>  Display </i> ). That&rsquo;s much lower than in the past few years, yet still well above our projections for investment-grade fixed income. This outlook highlights why maintaining an allocation to equities is vital for investors to meet their long-term goals, in our view.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/equities.png\" width=\"642\"/></p><p> The composition of returns is also changing. In the first few years of the recovery, equity returns were driven primarily by earnings growth, as companies cut costs dramatically in response to the recession and increased their operating margins. From 2012 to 2015, equity returns were fueled mostly by rising P/E valuations. Over the next decade, our forecasts suggest that earnings and dividend growth are likely to drive equity gains, while multiple expansion will probably be modest.</p><p> <b>  Preparing for Volatility </b></p><p> Yet even with this context, volatility remains a big deterrent for many investors. From economic growth concerns to regulatory changes and political risks, fears of instability are pervasive.</p><p> We think investors should cope with volatility by embracing it. Volatility isn&rsquo;t going away. But by accepting volatility, you can avoid making hasty and damaging decisions when turbulence strikes.</p><p> The first quarter of the year provides an excellent example. Equity markets around the world fell by more than 10% from January 1 through February 11, then rebounded sharply through March. By quarter-end, most of the sharp declines had been reversed. Investors who sold positions in mid-February would have locked in painful losses. But if you accept that volatility is a factor of life, it&rsquo;s so much easier to be prepared, to keep your cool when markets get rough&mdash;and to stick with an investing strategy.</p><p> <b>  Three Reasons to Stay Active </b></p><p> With so many challenges, it&rsquo;s tempting for some to stay on the sidelines or choose passive investing solutions. We believe this is a mistake for three reasons.</p><p> First, passive portfolios aren&rsquo;t risk free. It&rsquo;s a common misconception that going passive means eliminating risk. While an ETF does reduce the relative risk of underperforming a benchmark, it does nothing at all to mitigate absolute risk. So when markets are tumbling, an ETF that invests in the broad market has no way to offer protection. What&rsquo;s more, benchmarks are often prone to concentration risk, when a sector or industry becomes too big or too small for the wrong reasons.</p><p> Second, since returns will probably be relatively low compared to history, beating the market&mdash;even by a small margin&mdash;will be especially important for investors to meet their goals. Over a 10-year period, adding two or three percentage points to annual returns can make a difference of up to 32% in the cumulative return of a portfolio ( <i>  Display </i> ).</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/extra-return.png\" width=\"571\"/></p><p> Third, as economic growth rates and policies diverge between regions, the opportunities for active managers to select among winners and losers improve. Similarly, technological and regulatory change is creating uncommon opportunities that can&rsquo;t be captured effectively in an index.</p><p> Of course, active managers continue to face scrutiny on several fronts. That&rsquo;s why investors should make sure that the fees they are paying are well spent on active managers who don&rsquo;t hug the benchmark, have capacity constraints to invest effectively and use a disciplined process backed by robust research to facilitate skillful stockpicking.</p><p> With these points in mind, investors can find active strategies suited to their risk appetites and return objectives, which should do well over the long term, even in an environment of lower returns.

Somebody&rsquo;s view of how something can be&hellip;will be&hellip;.is the catalyst for achievement of great change.</p><h3> Who will ever forget  the power of one mans vision: &ldquo;I have a dream&hellip;.&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> His vision of how the world could be.  Should be.  Would be.  One day.</p><p> But what was Dr King&rsquo;s purpose?  It seems from all I have read and seen that his primary purpose was to help create a better, safer and fairer world for his children, and other children like them.</p><p> Purpose is intensely personal for most of us.  Vision is the picture of what we will create in order to achieve our purpose.</p><p> <strong>  Every business owner should have a vision of how their world will be. </strong></p><p> Each individual adviser should begin with their own &ldquo;end in mind&rdquo;&hellip;have a clear picture of what it is you are trying to create.  All too often professionals are asked by coaches, mentors and business gurus to &ldquo;define their purpose&rdquo; in order to empower themselves, and not surprisingly advisers struggle to express &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;.  The unspoken reason for this of course is that more often than not the advisers purpose is NOT to be an evangelist, missionary or social worker &ndash; there is no noble and higher purpose that was responsible for one being a professional adviser particularly.   It is a job.  It is simply how someone chose to make their living. They chose it because they are good at it, and there is a need for it, and they can make some money from doing it.  But it doesn&rsquo;t sound nice if we say that out loud when the guru&rsquo;s prompt us for our &ldquo;why&rdquo;. Our purpose is personal&hellip;.not for sharing with gurus.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a confession then: my vision for how my professional world will be involves me travelling to exotic places, eating wonderful food and drinking excellent wines with my lovely lady, while meeting and working with a huge range of interesting people from different cultures while earning more money than she can spend.  It is a lofty ambition to be sure.    There is also an ego-driven desire to help change a little part of the world and leave a positive imprint&hellip;.be remembered as being someone who made a difference&hellip;..so there is purpose underpinning why I do things that I do.  It is <strong>  purpose </strong>  which drives the desire to do things professionally, and deliver fabulous value and help change the world around me.</p><p> However purpose is not vision.  Purpose is how values and ethics and super-ego gel to determine how we will do what we do and why we are doing what we do. The vision on the other hand is the clear mental picture of the objective&hellip;the finishing line&hellip;.the future world we choose to have.  Something that isn&rsquo;t there yet&hellip;but which will be.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"153\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/visionary.png\" width=\"623\"/></p><p> Many many professionals confuse purpose with vision.  Because purpose is usually very personal it is not something that they often share, even with their close friends or business partners. The result is a lack of clarity of vision.  There is often no &ldquo;what do we want our business to look like&rdquo; because of the reluctance to share &ldquo;why I want my business to look like that&rdquo;.</p><p> Do not mistake purpose for vision.  Do not make the mistake of having no vision because you don&rsquo;t want to share your purpose. Keep your purpose personal, but define the business vision and express it.  Tell your people what the vision is. Paint the future picture of how your part of the business world will be.  Clear vision has the power to move the masses and shape the future, and should be the beginning point of a professional&rsquo;s business planning.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 15:19:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 15:19:41.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_jvFTK9N.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-a-clear-vision-has-the-power-to-move-the-masses-and-shape-the-future/\", \"post_id\": \"11859\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 15:19:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 15:19:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-a-clear-vision-has-the-power-to-move-the-masses-and-shape-the-future\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11857\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5778\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Advisors-A-Clear-Vision-Has-the-Power-to-Move-the-Masses-and-Shape-the-Future.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1077\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466409600,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5552,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Fundamentals: 5 Secrets to Sales Success","link":"fundamentals-5-secrets-to-sales-success","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I skied a lot this year, because we have had decent amounts of snow and also because I am Austrian, and that&rsquo;s what we do. I am also the Chief Sales Officer of my company, so sales success is equally important to me.</p><p> My son&rsquo;s girlfriend started the sport two years ago, and while she is making a lot of progress, I am also aware how important it is for her to have a solid foundation. Skiing in New England is not always fun, because the level of other skiers&rsquo; expertise on the slopes is fairly basic. And it seems a great number of people haven&rsquo;t learned proper skiing rules and etiquette (such as looking up the mountain before you push off), so it is more dangerous to ski in these areas &ndash; and that&rsquo;s not because of the terrain (really not that challenging) but because accidents can be caused by inexperience.</p><p> This  (of course!)  reminded me of selling, and, as many of you know, I like comparisons. It reminded me that if you have never learned the basics, you won&rsquo;t be able to build upon solid skills, or in the worst case scenario you will build upon bad habits. So while you might be able to ski downhill faster, you won&rsquo;t ski better or safer.</p><p> The same holds true for sales. If sales people (especially in a consultative sale environment) don&rsquo;t learn the fundamentals of a consultative sales process, they will just stay mediocre at best. So, what are some of the basics that are important to become a successful sales person?</p><h3> <strong>  Understanding the Process </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sales is a process and it&rsquo;s important to establish one that reflects the reality of your environment. By that I mean that people in a B2B industry will need to set-up a different process than companies that target end-user consumers.</p><h3> <strong>  Identifying Best Targets &ndash; Most Profitable Markets &amp; Decision-Makers/Influencers </strong></h3><p> <br/> Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather get to the real decision-makers at an ideal prospect in a profitable market fast? So, it is also  fundamental  to understand who the decision-maker is within a prospect company as your first and, potentially, most important step. It is also  fundamental  to identify what industries are most profitable and which decision makers within prospect companies make up a good client profile.</p><h3> <strong>  Establishing/Management of Your Database/CRM system </strong></h3><p> <br/> The backbone of every organization is the health of their database/CRM system. Another  fundamental  if you want to achieve success. Consistency and transparency are key in managing the data and the process. For some companies it might be enough to work off a spreadsheet (wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it, but it does work), but most companies will need a CRM (Customer Relationship Management). Personally, I am a big fan of Salesforce.com. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s intuitive and easy to handle.</p><h3> <strong>  Developing Effective Messaging </strong></h3><p> <br/> What you say and how you say it, is also  fundamental  when building relationships with prospects. There is nothing more annoying than sales people not owning their messages, being vague or at worst stumbling over their own words and being irrelevant.</p><p> And, if you work in an environment where the sales culture is focused on &ldquo;making the numbers&rdquo; rather than understanding HOW to make the numbers, it&rsquo;s really hard to succeed, especially if you are new at what you&rsquo;re doing.</p><h3> <strong>  Commitment to sales </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the  fundamentals  of building an effective sales team is the commitment to sales and providing the resources necessary to succeed. Recently, we were hired by a client in Pennsylvania to train newly hired sales people with very limited or no experience in their profession. We spent an entire week with the new recruits. Our goal was to provide them with the  fundamentals  of a consultative approach to sales and prospecting and to help them understand how to create their sales process so they will be able to represent their organization in the utmost professional way.</p><p> When these sales people were being interviewed, their managers (our clients) explained the sales process to them and that they would be receiving intensive sales training. They had not received those messages in previous job interviews. So, as a suggestion for all those job-hunting, when you interview for sales positions, ask questions about the company&rsquo;s sales cycle, if they have established a sales process and what  fundamentals  they expect or will train you on. It&rsquo;s important. It&rsquo;s  fundamental!</p><p> In Austria, most children learn how to ski in skiing school. As kids in elementary and secondary schools, we are sent to skiing camps every year and the first couple of days we don&rsquo;t even get to ski. We need to listen to ski rules, climb up the mountain (on skis- sideways!), master the (very challenging) T-Lifts. It is only mid-week, once we have gone through all the basics that we are allowed on the mountain to actually ski.</p><p> Maybe that should be a standard practice for companies. Before you have a sales person pick up the phone to prospect, have them work through the  fundamentals  (train them on the  fundamentals)  so they understand what sales is all about and how to create and follow a successful process.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 15:42:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 15:42:35.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_8UeibN6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/fundamentals-5-secrets-to-sales-success/\", \"post_id\": \"11861\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 15:42:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 15:42:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"fundamentals-5-secrets-to-sales-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11860\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5779\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fundamentals-5-Secrets-to-Sales-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"863\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466424000,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5553,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Annuities? Helping Your Clients See the Long-Term Benefits","link":"annuities-helping-your-clients-see-the-long-term-benefits","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Read any industry publication and you&rsquo;ll see that the buzz is about retirement income solutions. The choices include variable annuities (VAs) offering a range of different living benefits, target date mutual funds, and payout mutual funds, all designed to generate income during retirement years.</p><p> But with all the hype, one statistic has been overlooked: The median baby boomer is 54 years old, and the youngest boomer is in their mid-40&rsquo;s. With ten to twenty more years until retirement, accumulation is still a big issue for more than half of the 76 million boomers, as well as the younger generations following them. In this era of do-it-yourself planning and a failing retirement safety net, experts agree that most Americans need to save more. But many consumers have a big objection to annuities&mdash;simply stated, they&rsquo;re hesitant to tie up today&rsquo;s savings for tomorrow&rsquo;s income. So how can you help them overcome this block to see the benefits of annuities?</p><p> To maximize long-term savings, few things beat the power of tax-deferral. When you stockpile your investments for years or decades&mdash;compounding growth without stripping away 15 to 39 percent in taxes each year during the accumulation period&mdash;you could have substantially more by the time you reach your retirement.</p><p> A study, co-authored by University of Chicago professor, Ira Weiss, Ph.D., and Jefferson National, set out to prove this point. You may be surprised to learn that tax deferral can quickly outperform a taxable investment.  It may surprise you even more to learn how little time it can take for a tax-deferred account to break even with, and then outperform, a taxable account. The key is using a low-cost, no-load tax-advantaged investing solution.</p><h3> By the numbers: It doesn&rsquo;t take long for tax deferral to work</h3><p> <br/> How does the accumulation power of the tax-deferred, flat-fee VA stack up against a taxable account?</p><li> In just four years, the typical mutual fund investor with a conservative portfolio will likely generate more income from a flat-fee VA than a taxable account.</li><li> After 10 years, investors with a moderate risk profile will break even and then outperform a taxable account.</li><li> After 14 years, aggressive investors will break even and earn more.</li><li> Investors using an active management strategy almost always improve performance within the first year.</li><li> Higher after-tax returns are achieved when tax-inefficient assets are held in a flat-fee VA and tax-efficient assets are invested in a taxable vehicle. <br/>  </li><p> This research goes on to show that tax-deferral can help increase returns an average of 100 bps&mdash;without increasing risk.  Meanwhile, the asset-based fees of a traditional variable annuity, averaging 1.35 percent annually, can virtually eviscerate the accumulation benefits of tax deferral, and quickly erode the performance potential of a portfolio.</p><p> In addition to the flat-fee advantage, this new breed of VA works harder than the traditional VA by offering a broad selection of investment options&mdash;virtually a tax-advantaged investing solution with 9 times more funds than the typical VA. By eliminating commissions, surrender fees, and complex insurance features, flat-fee VAs create value dramatically faster than traditional VAs.</p><h3> More time on your side with the flat-fee VA</h3><p> <br/> The intuition is simple: The longer a portfolio can benefit from tax-free compounding, the more it can accumulate versus a taxable account. For the typical moderate investor with just 10 years to save, the gains in a flat-fee VA can add up.</p><p> But what about the tax implications at withdrawal? With the flat-fee VA, all gains withdrawn are taxed as ordinary income. With the taxable account, these withdrawals will benefit from lower tax rates&mdash;generally, a mix of dividend income rates, long-term capital gains rates (e.g., from share sales), and ordinary income rates (e.g., from interest income). However, the benefit of tax-free compounding over 10, 20, and 30 years can be so great that it outweighs the cost of higher taxation upon withdrawal.</p><p> And as you can see, in addition to time horizon, there is another factor at work: the tax efficiency of the asset class.</p><p> Different types of assets have different tax characteristics, or tax-efficiencies, and may benefit from tax-deferral to different degrees. Interest-income-producing assets in the conservative portfolio&mdash;such as long-term bonds&mdash;benefit from tax deferral to a higher degree than assets that benefit from unrealized capital gains&mdash;such as large cap equities.</p><h3> Benefits for the active manager</h3><p> <br/> In a taxable account, trading creates a taxable event that can generate further drag on returns. Trading frequency can span a wide range, including passive indexed fund holding, rebalancing with no other turnover, rebalancing with some additional turnover, and active management. Regardless, in a flat-fee VA, investors can turn over their portfolios without generating any tax consequences.</p><p> The case for active managers is especially compelling. Active managers frequently move in and out of positions, trying to benefit from short-term market moves. While this has the potential to capture alpha, the inefficiencies of paying ordinary income tax on short-term gains may offer little upside. But trading inside a flat-fee VA permits unlimited trading while deferring all ordinary income taxes on gains to a future date, which is almost always more advantageous.</p><h3> Sweet spot: high-net-worth clients</h3><p> High-net-worth clients can easily max out the low contribution limits of their 401(k)s and IRAs. They&rsquo;re also more likely to receive lump sums during their accumulation years, such as an inheritance, bonus, or asset sale. If forced to save for the long term in a taxable vehicle, many of these investors could leave a considerable amount of money on the table.</p><p> A flat-fee VA, however, provides an excellent alternative to maximize tax-deferred savings, allowing lifetime contribution limits of $10 million or more, with no restrictions on contributions in a given year. Right off the bat, larger accounts can benefit with the flat-fee VA. Also, break-even periods decline as contributions increase&mdash;a big win for high-net-worth investors with longer time horizons.</p><h3> The big takeaway</h3><p> <br/> Although the market&rsquo;s focus on retirement income is important, the reality is that retirement income is largely a function of accumulation. If an investor wants to generate more retirement income, they need to accumulate more. Fortunately, most boomers, and the generations that follow, have many years of accumulation ahead of them. These investors should be maximizing accumulation, and tax-deferral can help. Tax-deferral can supercharge accumulation, translating into increased income at retirement.</p><p> While traditional tax-deferred vehicles, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, are adequate for many Americans, higher-net-worth individuals (and even many middle-class households) can easily max out their contributions. Many could benefit from more tax deferral. So what is the solution? New flat-fee VAs, used as a low-cost, no-load tax-advantaged investing solution, can be an important tool in any retirement portfolio, especially for assets that are currently tax-inefficient.</p><p> With ten to twenty years or more until their retirement, more than half of all boomers have an opportunity to make a decision that will affect the financial security of their retirement.</p><p> So, instead of paying for income benefits today, which won&rsquo;t be used for years or decades, boomers could benefit from your counsel to keep the focus on watching costs and accumulating more, to generate more retirement income when they need it.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 15:59:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 15:59:12.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_SZs7EVK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/annuities-helping-your-clients-see-the-long-term-benefits/\", \"post_id\": \"11863\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 15:59:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 15:59:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"annuities-helping-your-clients-see-the-long-term-benefits\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11862\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5780\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Annuities-Helping-Your-Clients-See-the-Long-Term-Benefits.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"945\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466413200,"author_id":298,"chart_url":""}

Have you ever noticed?  Think about the first time you purchased a car.  I am willing to bet it was a completely different experience from the last time you purchased a car.</p><p> The first time you purchased a car, you traveled from lot to lot, speaking with eager sales people, who were excited to tell you about the features and benefit of the cars on their lots.  You most likely spent days, week, or even months gathering information before making your decision.  This was when sales people were  the  resource for information. These salespeople had the knowledge that we needed, and we sought them out for that knowledge.</p><p> The last time you purchased a car&hellip; you &ldquo;Googled it&rdquo;.  You jumped online and researched your ideal make &amp; model, safety features, blue book values, upgrades, colors, etc.  You didn&rsquo;t travel from lot to lot&hellip; you did this sitting on your couch after dinner a few nights.  It&rsquo;s safe to say that you were about 70% through the sales process before you ever walked onto a lot&hellip; agreed?  That 70% happened at the tips of your fingers, on your couch after dinner.  Now that you made the decision, all you have left is to go to the sales person on the lot, and make your purchase.  At this point, it&rsquo;s just about finding the right sales person that can guide you through the hassle-free process you desire.</p><p> What about the car lots that weren&rsquo;t online?  Doesn&rsquo;t really matter, right?  After all, you were able to find exactly what you wanted and made the decision that would lead you to the purchase of your new car.  Car lots are a dime a dozen, which means that the lots that were not online for you to research were simply ruled out.</p><p> If you take your current sales process and apply it to these buying processes, which one is more compatible?  Are you running a sales team the outdated way? Is your team still cold calling and foot canvassing, interrupting the momentum of the decision maker because it happens to be convenient for your sales team?  Are you the &ldquo;car lot&rdquo; that is simply omitted for not being available when your prospect searched for a company with your capabilities?  Are you obsolete, outdated, and on your way to extinction? Evolve or dissolve.</p><p> Do you sell or do you influence?  Today&rsquo;s buying process is about influencing.  Shouldn&rsquo;t your sales process match today&rsquo;s buying process?  Shouldn&rsquo;t your team be influencing the purchase? </p><p> Did your sales team hit quota last year?</p><h3> Social Selling is not a fad&hellip; it&rsquo;s an evolution.  The sales process has evolved. </h3><p> <br/> As leaders, it is our responsibility to invest in the training and programs available for sales teams today.

In all of my combined years as a traditional financial advisor and wealth empowerment coach, I have found that most people equate their sense of worth to how much money they make, what they have, and what they can provide for others through the exchange of money. </p><p> What if you are someone who doesn&rsquo;t bring home a paycheck? Someone such as a stay-at-home mom. What if you are an Entrepreneur, loaded with talent and brilliance, yet steady profits elude you.</p><p> Because you chose to stay at home to raise your children, does that somehow render you unworthy? Less valuable? Because you don&rsquo;t bring money into the household, do you find that you&rsquo;ve lost your voice in the financial decisions that are made for the family? At times, do you feel invisible?</p><p> As an Entrepreneur, you have a dream, a big dream. And whatever this dream may be, you have the courage to see it through and you do whatever it takes to make that dream come to life. Yet, if you don&rsquo;t  believe  that the dream can come true, if you don&rsquo;t  believe  in your worth and your value, your dream doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance. And that doesn&rsquo;t just leave you feeling disappointed, the effects are felt by those you love and by people who don&rsquo;t even know who you are and what you offer. None the less, they are left wanting because you withhold from them what they need because of your lack of belief and self-worth.</p><p> At some point in time, we all got the crazy idea that we don&rsquo;t deserve to succeed, that we don&rsquo;t deserve to have a voice, that we are unworthy of having our dreams come true and not good enough in helping others to do the same. It&rsquo;s as if we feel that we should be punished with the way in which we self-sabotage our dreams, goals, and happiness.</p><p> This false belief, this crazy idea, that you are not deserving of success can show up in  a number of different ways. For some, it may show up as lack within your relationship with money. For an entrepreneur, it may show up as low demand for your product or lack of clients. Maybe you are a writer that aspires to publish a novel but can&rsquo;t seem to bring yourself to dedicating the time to write.</p><p> Have you ever stopped to consider that the belief that you don&rsquo;t deserve to be successful or worthy of your ideal life may be a form of self-prejudice? Thoughts of prejudice are often seen as taking place outside of ourselves. Prejudice is often directed towards groups of people based on the color of their skin, their religion, or their socio-economic conditions. You see it happen in athletic clubs, in the schools, and in the workplace. But did you ever stop to think that you may be  <strong>  prejudiced against yourself </strong> ?</p><p> Over the years I have come to realize that what you see happening  outside  of you is merely a symbolic reflection of what&rsquo;s happening  inside  you. What&rsquo;s that expression?  &ldquo;Your outer world is a reflection of your inner condition&rdquo;  &hellip; something like that. So if that is true, then that means what you are thinking and believing about yourself is being projected outside of you. Your outer world &hellip; your relationships, your work, your business &hellip; all a mirror.</p><p> Check yourself in the mirror. What do you see reflecting back at you? Sometimes the mirror is something you see on TV, sometimes the mirror is playing itself out in the middle of your son&rsquo;s soccer match. And other times, your mirror is what&rsquo;s happening or not happening in your business, your relationships, your life.</p><p> In the past, there have been times when I looked into the mirror of my business and at the surface I saw a lack of clientele or a low number of women registering for my programs. It appeared that almost everyone was saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p><p> But if my business is a mirror, then I have to ask myself, where have I been saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;? Do I believe that I can be continuously successful? (no?) Do I believe that I am deserving of the best in life &ndash; peace of mind, ease, equality, and wealth? (no?)</p><p> If others had been saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;, then I had been saying the same. I had been prejudiced against myself, a form of arrogance because I chose to believe that I was unworthy, undeserving, and unequal to all the others out there who were living out their dreams.</p><p> Truth is, there is no such thing as being  undeserving . That is a concept made up by the ego, the thought system of fear, and there&rsquo;s no basis in truth. God, or nature, does not seek to punish His own creations &hellip; so why would you?</p><p> Tough question, I know. But if you ever wish to step fully into your power, own your worth, and reclaim your wealth, you&rsquo;ve got to look into your mirror and listen for the answers.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-19 16:45:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-19 16:45:00.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_hiMrEaY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-being-prejudiced-against-yourself-the-only-thing-stopping-you/\", \"post_id\": \"11869\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-19 16:45:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-19 16:45:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-being-prejudiced-against-yourself-the-only-thing-stopping-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11868\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5783\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Is-Being-Prejudiced-Against-Yourself-the-Only-Thing-Stopping-You.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1425\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466442000,"author_id":113,"chart_url":""}

Stop agonizing over mistakes or bad decisions you made. All that does is cause you to beat yourself up and damage your self-confidence and self-esteem. You have to stop living in a world full of should haves, could haves or would haves. All you can &ndash; and must &ndash; do is learn from the past and use that knowledge to benefit you on a going forward basis.</p><p> Avoid at all costs allowing your mind to wander too long in the future. When you do this, you are destined to follow one of two paths. The first path is &ldquo;worry&rdquo;&mdash;you become obsessed with what could go wrong with any action you might take. This path eventually causes you to overload on fear, which usually results in you doing nothing, which leads to stagnation and eventually failure.</p><h3> The second future path is &ldquo;exhilaration&rdquo; and false optimism over what you will or might do.</h3><p> <br/> Again, don&rsquo;t allow your mind to spend too much time here either. You become obsessed over all of the great things that lie ahead. When this happens, you leave yourself open to missing warnings of an approaching problem or worse. Want an example? Google Leon Lett, former player for the Dallas Cowboys. Leon became so obsessed over &ldquo;what&rdquo; was about to happen that he missed the crisis rapidly approaching in the form of Don Bebe of the Buffalo Bills.</p><p> So what&rsquo;s left?

{"original_id":5558,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Considering a Model of Ensemble Advisors? 5 Ways it Can Succeed","link":"considering-a-model-of-ensemble-advisors-5-ways-it-can-succeed","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It seems to be the latest phenomenon: Advisors who are contemplating a move entertain the idea of assembling a group of unrelated advisors &ndash; friends with whom they&rsquo;ve discussed the idea, colleagues they don&rsquo;t currently partner with and even advisors from other firms &ndash; and moving en masse to a common destination. These advisors are not necessarily motivated by interest in expanding a team or forming a new partnership. Their hope is that one book of business has a higher value and/or is &ldquo;more important&rdquo; to another firm by association with friends who are likewise interested in talking to the same firm.</p><p> The idea seems to be gaining popularity as more advisors are contemplating moves. As part of their natural conversations with friends and colleagues, they are sharing some of the details of their quest, often generating the thought that there might be some strength in going together. One advisor knows another, and soon a &ldquo;pseudo team&rdquo; is born.</p><p> Joining forces with other like-minded advisors who share a desire to make the move has many advantages. For instance, it allows them to perform their due diligence in tandem, gain scale and recreate the team environment from where they originated. But do benefits like these outweigh the potential negatives of working as a larger yet only loosely connected group?</p><p> Taking a closer look, there are 5 points that can help advisors who are considering this approach go into it based on reasonable expectations.</p><h3> 1) Adding leverage to the deal <br/>  </h3><p> Deal economics are structured based on individual production, therefore if the only reason for approaching another firm as a group is to negotiate a better deal, this will not be successful. A firm must evaluate an advisor&rsquo;s business based on its individual merits: How much is fee-based, the size of the accounts, what the compliance record looks like. Unrelated advisors won&rsquo;t be in any better position to negotiate superior deal terms simply because they agree to go through the process together.  Nonetheless, a group representing exponentially more in production and assets gets noticed and remembered and is impactful to a local office.</p><h3> 2) Launching a new office <br/>  </h3><p> If the goal is to create a new presence &ndash; for example, a satellite office for a firm that&rsquo;s not in the area (regional firms still have an appetite for this) &ndash; then having a ready-made pipeline of advisors who want to be a part of it is a huge advantage. In some cases it may be a necessity, if not certainly more realistic. Firms typically require anywhere from $2mm to $5mm in production in order to consider a new presence. They are unlikely to move forward with such a plan until there is a strong commitment demonstrated in the requisite amount of assets and production.</p><h3> 3) Providing a breakaway opportunity <br/>  </h3><p> Is it possible for a group of industry colleagues to come together to build an independent wealth management firm, yet continue to retain their respective separate businesses, like a co-op model? Certainly, there are clear advantages to being able to share space and other resources, plus split the costs based on combined revenue, assets and human capital. Yet another advantage is that a &ldquo;team&rdquo; allows an advisor to create a more substantial presence&mdash;a bigger firm look and feel while preserving the ownership of his individual practice.</p><p> The challenge is in establishing team protocols, such as defining how decisions will be made and resolving any potential conflicts. Does everyone get an equal vote? While this might be fair, it can be inefficient, time consuming and ultimately counterproductive for every decision to put to a group vote. It&rsquo;s equally important to understand what happens if the arrangement doesn&rsquo;t work out&mdash;how are shared resources to be split? Most groups would benefit from using a third-party industry expert in creating the optimal structure.</p><h3> 4) The added ability to divide and conquer <br/>  </h3><p> Does sharing the responsibilities of the exploration process with a pal or two saves time and energy&mdash; that is, each person being responsible for some part of the due diligence process and then comparing notes? It sounds good in theory and may work during the preliminary gathering of basic information, but what goes into choosing the best firm or business model is part art and part science. Determining if the right cultural fit is there is a very personal and somewhat subjective decision that will require focus early on.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 5) &ldquo;Take me with you&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> There are advisors who simply won&rsquo;t move on their own. They aren&rsquo;t willing to do the legwork or they are stuck due to inertia, living under the assumption that nothing better exists. But when a buddy shares what he&rsquo;s considering, they don&rsquo;t want to be left behind. They may even &ldquo;tag along&rdquo; to a colleague&rsquo;s meeting. Friends can be a powerful motivator: If not for the friend, they would likely remain stuck. However, it is critical to avoid allowing this additional advisor to disrupt your momentum or create unnecessary distractions.</p><h3> Why not form a partnership? <br/>  </h3><p> In some cases operating side-by-side in this new model, and not under a formal team agreement, may be a way to see if an eventual partnership makes sense or if there is potential for a future merger or acquisition of the separate practices. For others, they like the familiarity and collegiality of working among people they like and respect but don&rsquo;t want to join the businesses in a more substantive way.</p><p> It&rsquo;s challenging enough for even the strongest and most longstanding formal partners to be on the same page when it comes to any major decision. Each business is unique and every advisor has his own set of goals and deal breakers. Advisors who have not worked as partners and developed a process for making decisions face greater challenges in coming to a consensus as a group.</p><p> Not everyone wants to be a trailblazer. The good news is that the changing landscape has opened up a new world of opportunities for advisors to define how and where best to serve their clients and their own business goals. A model such as this offers advisors a potentially less risky option, providing some security and strength in numbers, as well as the ability to tap into shared perspectives, so long as they go in eyes wide open, and with reasonable expectations.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 14:56:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 14:56:25.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_qjvFt26.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/considering-a-model-of-ensemble-advisors-5-ways-it-can-succeed/\", \"post_id\": \"11873\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 14:56:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 14:56:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"considering-a-model-of-ensemble-advisors-5-ways-it-can-succeed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11872\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5786\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Considering-a-Model-of-Ensemble-Advisors-5-Ways-it-Can-Succeed.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"765\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466528400,"author_id":50,"chart_url":""}

They mirror consciously. They mirror well. <br/>  </h3><p> The power of mirroring has been keenly on my mind in the aftermath of the Orlando shootings. Of all the responses to the nightclub attack, here is the one that stirred me the most. It is a sublime tale of mirroring. It took place on a JetBlue flight that carried the grandmother of Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, one of the club-goers that got killed in the shootings, to Orlando to attend Luis&rsquo; funeral.</p><p> In a Facebook POST, Kelly Davis Karas describes how she and fellow flight attendant Melinda had the idea to pass around a piece of paper to everyone on board and invite them to sign it for this grieving grandmother. Well, people couldn&rsquo;t stop writing, and soon Kelly and Melinda ended up handing out more and more pieces of paper.</p><p> When we gathered them together to present them to her, Kelly writes, we didn&rsquo;t have just a sheet of paper covered in names, which is what I had envisioned. Instead, we had page after page after page after page of long messages offering condolences, peace, love and support. There were even a couple of cash donations, and more than a few tears.</p><p> And instead of the usual mad dash to get off the plane, this is what unfolded.</p><p> As we deplaned, EVERY SINGLE PERSON STOPPED TO OFFER HER THEIR CONDOLENCES. Some just said they were sorry, some touched her hand, some hugged her, some cried with her. But every single person stopped to speak to her, and not a single person was impatient at the slower deplaning process.</p><p> Extraordinary circumstances, yes. Mirroring behaviors spread like wildfire. And a deeper collective consciousness was tapped. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> This same consciousness gets tapped when we mirror behavior in everyday circumstances. At work, at home. We don&rsquo;t mirror the petty, the angry, the small-minded. We mirror the best in the other person. We mirror it consciously, and in the act of doing so, we accelerate our personal success. Here&rsquo;s what everyday mirroring looks like:</p><li> I mirror your energy. I pick up on your speech pattern, your physical expressiveness, your body rhythm, the spirit with which you show up. I choose to get in synch with this energy, and in the act of &ldquo;synching up&rdquo; with you, I get in synch with your unspoken dreams and aspirations, and in turn, my own.</li><li> I mirror your words. By using the same words you use, or words with similar meaning, words that expand the resonance of your linguistic choices, I foster a rich intellectual and emotional connection between us.</li><li> I mirror your intent. Even when your words are bumbling and perhaps not precise, I intuit the intent behind the words you speak. And when this intent is pure, I choose to meet you with the same intent. Yes, I mirror it back.</li><li> I mirror your higher self. On a day when you behave like a jerk and irritate the heck out of me, I remember who you are when you&rsquo;re at your best. Instead of mirroring the jerk for you, I mirror your highest self. I uplift us with my choice. I take us both to higher ground. <br/>  </li><p> Tragic events jolt us back into the knowledge that at the core, you and I are never separate from each other. When I consciously mirror the best part of you, I help us remember how connected we truly are.</p><p> Success is inevitable.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 15:09:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 15:09:43.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_fNHa01I.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/in-wake-of-orlando-tragedy-a-story-on-how-mirroring-behavior-can-change-your-success/\", \"post_id\": \"11875\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 15:09:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 15:09:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"in-wake-of-orlando-tragedy-a-story-on-how-mirroring-behavior-can-change-your-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11874\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5787\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/In-Wake-of-Orlando-Tragedy-A-Story-on-How-Mirroring-Behavior-Can-Change-Your-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"634\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466528400,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}

The latest meeting was a FinTech Summit for a select few at the White House last Friday. I was lucky enough to be one of the select few and thought I&rsquo;d blog about the four key panel discussions that took place this week. <img alt=\"\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jeff-Zients.jpg\" width=\"768\"/> Jeff Zients, Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council for the White House makes the opening remarks The first focused upon the changing landscape of Financial Services, and the role of government in FinTech.Marla Blow, Founder and CEO of FS Card Inc, and Partner with Fenway Summer LLC set the scene.  She cited the fact that many FinTech start-ups were trying to create companies that worked around existing financial regulations, in order to ensure they didn&rsquo;t have to face the capital requirements and onerous administration that goes with being a fully fledged financial institution.  I loved the fact that she stated that: &ldquo;Regulatory arbitrage is not a good business model&rdquo;It&rsquo;s not because if you&rsquo;re doing something that is finance with technology, you will get regulated &hellip; eventually.  It was also interesting to hear that the US regulatory structure is more Napoleonic than Anglo-Saxon.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want principles based regulation. We want safe harbours and rules, which means regulation takes a long time to develop and always lags the markets.&rdquo;It sure does.  When Dodd-Frank first appeared in July 2010, it was already 850 pages. Three years later, this had ballooned into 13,789 pages and more than 15 million words.A good illustration of this is the Volcker Rule.  Paul Volcker originally wrote it down in a three-page letter to the president.  When Dodd-Frank went to Congress, the Volcker Rule took up 10 pages.  When the proposed regulations for the Volcker Rule finally emerged, the text had increased to 298 pages, and was accompanied by more than 1,300 questions about 400 topics.Even more fundamentally, just as banks have tried to get to grips with the radical restructuring of Dodd-Frank, the rules are still being written.  A year ago, 40% of Dodd-Frank&rsquo;s 400 tules had yet to be written and implemented and, just as all this goes on, everyone realises that hey, it&rsquo;s not that important anyway.&ldquo;For most of the short life of Dodd-Frank, there has been an aggressive campaign to repeal it,&rdquo; Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said at a Brookings Institution appearance earlier this month. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing proposed changes that are in the name of simplifying it that would actually go at the heart of some of the protections that we&rsquo;ve put in place.&rdquo;Wow!  Maybe a good thing as just last week, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced the plan to replace Dodd-Frank with the Financial CHOICE Act.  Nothing like rules-based regulation is there?This was echoed by Bruce Wallace, Chief Digital Officer at Silicon Valley Bank, who made it clear that the decentralised and fragmented structure of US regulation was inhibiting innovation.  Bruce was asked by the panel chair (Secretary Penny Pritzker, US Department of Commerce) how government policy could be improved in order to promote FinTech?Bruce replied that the rules need to be simplified. There are 400 agencies, sub-agencies and government departments that most startups have to deal with.  That is a problem for companies that are worrying more about how to get their next round of funding, how to find customers and how to build their management team.  The last thing they want to have to do is work out how to find the regulator they have to deal with.  In fact, for a start-up, engaging with government is hard.  How could this be improved?  You need to change government from seeking out startups to startups seeking out you. It needs to be clear what government can do for them, and where to go as the touch point that will help them move forward.  You need a simplified structure that provides a single place to go to and one that can shield start-ups from the sausage making regulatory structure. Just make it a simplified engagement model with one website and one agency, rather than hundreds of agencies and 1000&rsquo;s of websites, requiring millions in legal fees.##TRENDING##Penny Pritzker then made it clear that all Americans should have access to the digital economy and, in her view, the Government&rsquo;s role is to promote and support the innovations in that economy.  Adam Carson, Managing Partner for Global Technology Strategy &amp; Partnerships at JPMorgan Chase, felt that this goal could best be achieved by copying the UK regulatory sandbox approach in some form (early dialogue with the FCA is already in play).  He added that the issue is that there are too many regulations and regulators involved with the banks today, and that their policies are inconsistent and too fragmented. I guess you can see that in the  <a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/investor-relations/document/JPMC_2011_annual_report_complete.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2011 annual report shareholder update </a>  from Jamie Dimon (page 19). <img alt=\"\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Financial-Stablility.jpg\" width=\"768\"/> Adam asked the question that everyone at conferences asks: where is the Uber of FinTech? The answer is there isn&rsquo;t one because there are many regulations they have to comply with1. A specific constraint is that the start-up would have to be able to scale massively with bulletproof security. That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t see many start-ups breaking through these barriers and, more often than not, they want to partner with the banks to make this work.  Equally, the banks want to partner with the start-ups to improve the user experience. This is because the bank has to keep up with the best benchmark digital players: Google, Amazon and Facebook. When your user is going from Google to Amazon to Facebook to JPM, the experience has to be as good. This is why Adam has 300 people is Silicon Valley working to do this and those people are from those firms.Equally, many FinTech firms are collaborating with the banks and the main thing the start-ups want from banks is customers.  The result should be that consumers are better served and is the economy improved as a result. That&rsquo;s a win/win for everybody. This is why we&rsquo;re seeing so much partnering and acquiring and discussion:</p><li> <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/03/25/northwestern-mutual-acquires-learnvest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  North West Mutual acquired Learnvest </a> ;</li><li> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aa146994-4b61-11e5-b558-8a9722977189.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  BlackRock acquired FutureAdvisor </a> ;</li><li> <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/robo-advisor-sigfig-raises-40-million-from-investors-including-ubs-eaton-vance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  UBS invested in SigFig </a> ;</li><li> Ondeck, SoFi, Prosper and LendingClub: all have bank partner models;</li><li> Stripe, Square, Braintree, PayPal and Venmo all sit on bank structures;</li><li> Simple and Moven sit on bank licenses;</li>&hellip; the list goes on and it illustrates well that there&rsquo;s a lot of collaboration and partnering in the USA that is just not visible &hellip; until you look under the hood.Ali Rosenthal, VP of Strategic Partnerships at Wealthfront, agreed.  &ldquo;We all want to partner with firms that are regulated and trusted&rdquo;, she said, but added that what FinTech is doing is &ldquo;reducing costs significantly whilst increasing distribution to all&rdquo;.  This is a key aspect of what is happening in the world.  Technology is reducing barriers and giving access to everyone at low cost.  That is the beauty of the new FinTech model on top of those old banking structures and licences.Finally Tim Estes, Founder and CEO of Digital Reasoning, hit the key point where the government could focus.  The government needs to identify where it needs tight regulations &ndash; vis-&agrave;-vis the rules based regulation a la Dodd-Frank &ndash; and where it can apply loose regulations &ndash; vis-&agrave;-vis tree principles-based regulation of the FCA.&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a Wild West on the left and a Regulatory Boa Constrictor on the right, we need to work out when and where we need to be in the scale of this with security of data.

There are too many bodies doing too many things and no single sign-on to the regulatory structure.  As a result, the start-ups innovate around the regulations whilst leaving the incumbents to deal with the overhead.However, as mentioned at the start, regulatory arbitrage is not a great business model so the FinTech dreamers better make assure they&rsquo;ve ticked those regulatory boxes through collaboration and partnership, or be prepared to face the regulatory meltdown.","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 15:25:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 15:25:00.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_CqkdkJG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/americas-regulatory-issue-is-too-many-cooks/\", \"post_id\": \"11882\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 15:25:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 15:25:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"americas-regulatory-issue-is-too-many-cooks\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11878\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5789\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/America\\u2019s-Regulatory-Issue-is-Too-Many-Cooks.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"661\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466503200,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

As noted, research indicates 90% of Millennial clients want an adviser who is within 10 years of their own age, and firms with NextGen advisers are positioned to grow at a faster rate. Given this information, it seems that the future of the financial industry truly lies in the hands of Millennials.</p><p> As a result, it is imperative that you hire a member of my generation and create the profile of an attractive employer. But how?</p><h3> <b>  Here are 5 ways to position your firm as an ideal employer for Millennials: </b> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Career advancement opportunities <br/>  </h3><p> According to a PWC report, career advancement opportunities are the top priority for Millennial workers. In fact, 52% of responders detailed in the report indicate that such opportunities are the main factors that attract them to employers.  Make sure you discuss the timelines for progression with your new employees. If you don&rsquo;t you may find it hard to keep them with your company.</p><h3> 2. Competitive wages and good benefits <br/> <br/>  </h3><p> Many sources indicate that money is, while not the highest priority, still a large factor in the Millennial decision-making process.  As such, remaining as competitive as possible from a compensation standpoint should be one of yours.  According to EY, some organizations are creating a larger initial salary component for recent college graduates in order to remain competitive with the industry and to help support their young FAs as they begin their careers.</p><p> &ldquo;Our capacity to attract, retain and manage executive talent does not depend on the compensation package, but rather on our ability to create a sense of belonging to an organization that offers a long-term relationship and a professional development opportunity, and that has a clear conception of itself, of what it wants to be, and of how to achieve it.&rdquo; &ndash; Armando Garza Sada, PWC</p><h3> 3. Training and development programs <br/>  </h3><p> As a Universum report states, Millennials appreciate when organizations prioritize the learning and development of their employers.t 44% of responding business students indicated that they were seeking employers that offer training and development. Effective onboarding strategies paired with on the job training measures are greatly useful.</p><h3> 4. Friendly and innovative work environments <br/>  </h3><p> Research indicates that Millennials will feel more at home in work environments that utilize cutting edge technology. Leveraging the naturally &ldquo;tech&rdquo; gifted Millennials and having them train on new technology platforms and tools may allow you to get more value out of them when senior advisers use them. Moreover, Millennials are quite interested in &ldquo;friendly work environments.&rdquo; In fact, Universum indicates that this was named as a key consideration by 40% of the students they surveyed. Make sure you broadcast images of your team bonding! Especially if you get together for events outside of the office. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 5. Work/life balance <br/>  </h3><p> Work/life balance is a priority for all generations, and Millennials are no exception.</p><p> Another important thing to keep in mind is that Millennials want to do meaningful work and many value careers that impact the lives of others. Make sure they can see the value they are creating.</p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> These five characteristics aren&rsquo;t novel, and many of them are things you may already be providing. If not, embrace this list to help attract Millennials to  <i>  your </i>  company.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 15:32:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 15:32:16.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_xmd93lU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-ways-to-position-your-firm-as-an-ideal-employer-for-millennials/\", \"post_id\": \"11884\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 15:32:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 15:32:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-ways-to-position-your-firm-as-an-ideal-employer-for-millennials\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11883\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5790\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5-Ways-to-Position-Your-Firm-as-an-Ideal-Employer-for-Millennials.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"709\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466506800,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5563,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The U.S. Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule: How Does It Affect You?","link":"the-u-s-department-of-labor-fiduciary-rule-how-does-it-affect-you","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Under the Department of Labor&rsquo;s new fiduciary rule, financial services providers are required to acknowledge fiduciary status for themselves and their advisors when giving retirement advice. The rule presents sweeping changes for the money management industry. Smaller advisory firms currently relying on third-party fees and commissions for the lion&rsquo;s share of their revenue could be heavily affected by the compliance costs. Larger firms, on the other hand, may actually see their bottom line improve. If you haven&rsquo;t already done so, we recommend you start talking with your existing client base, embrace a technology-supported workflow system and consider segmenting your client base to clarify the necessary next steps.</p><h3> <strong>  IS LONG-GESTATING LEGISLATION GOOD NEWS? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The U.S. Department of Labor&rsquo;s new fiduciary rule, the first financial advisory regulatory effort in more than 40 years, was released April 6, 2016. After six years in development plus a lengthy commentary period that encompassed a wide range of stakeholders, the resulting rule is being met with some mixed reviews and a fair amount of caution, but with largely positive pronouncements from several key lawmakers, investment bankers and many established and successful financial advisors.</p><p> As communicated by the Department, the rule&rsquo;s mission is straightforward: Require more retirement investment advisors to put their clients&rsquo; best interests first, by expanding the types of retirement investment advice covered by fiduciary protections.</p><p> During the proposal review period, many of our advisor clients asked us to offer guidance on the &ldquo;new landscape&rdquo; of retirement investment advice. Due to the many conflicting opinions in the marketplace and the fact that the Department of Labor (DOL) itself forecast several changes to the proposed rule, we waited for the final version. To little surprise, many of the restrictions in the original proposed rule have been softened. We think the final ruling will actually help strengthen the discipline of retirement advice and elevate the industry in investors&rsquo; eyes. Yes, it may cause some firms to dramatically change the way they do business, however, many firms could thrive in the newly transparent environment.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a look at the new rule, how it may affect certain advisors, and what those advisors should do manage change under the new law.</p><h3> <strong>  BACKGROUND </strong></h3><p> <br/> Since 1974, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) has provided the DOL with authority to protect America&rsquo;s tax-deferred retirement savings accounts. Despite the dramatic change in the financial markets over the last few decades, not the least of which is the seismic shift from defined benefit plans to self-directed IRAs and 401(k)s, the rules governing investment advice have not substantively changed since 1975. Under the old rules, broker and financial advisor recommendations only had to meet a &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; criterion, considered a much less demanding standard critics insist led to excessive fees from some advisors and/or a reliance on high-commission-paying products rather than less costly products that would perform equally well.</p><p> Today, more than 75 million American households have savings in an employer-based retirement plan, an IRA or both. More than 40 million families hold $7.3 trillion in IRA assets. An additional $6.7 trillion is held in 401(k)s and other employer-sponsored plans. Plus, hundreds of billions of these dollars roll over into IRAs each year1 &ndash; much of it saddled with transfer commissions that can be as high as 10%.2 The Obama administration maintains these savings are particularly at risk because advice regarding IRA investments (and IRA rollovers) is rarely protected under ERISA and Internal Revenue Code rules. According to the Government Accountability Office, under the old suitability rule, retirement savers often were subject to &ldquo;biased information and aggressive marketing of IRAs.&rdquo;3 In fact, the regulatory impact analysis released along with the proposed rule estimated families with IRAs could save more than $4 billion per year if the proposed rule at the time was fully implemented.4</p><p> Fast forward to today. While the new rule by no means does away with onerous fees and commissions entirely, it places a major disclosure requirement on all advisors dealing with retirement savings. However, it also details several &ldquo;carve-outs&rdquo; that have been characterized as Wall Street dodging a bullet.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  THE NEW RULE: AN OVERVIEW </strong></h3><p> <br/> The effective date of the new rule is June 7, 2016, with an applicability date of April 10, 2017, and full compliance date of January 1, 2018 &ndash; allowing financial services providers ample time to make the basic changes from non-fiduciary to fiduciary status. The rule, with its near 1,000 pages and several amendments, is published in the Federal Register and is available in its entirety at federalregister.gov. Here are the highlights.</p><p> Fiduciary &ndash; A Broadened Definition5 Under the new rule, financial services providers are required to acknowledge fiduciary status for themselves and their advisors when giving retirement advice. While there are other terms linked to the definition of fiduciary, the full scope is:</p><li> Exercises discretionary authority or control with respect to the management of a plan;</li><li> Exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of plan assets;</li><li> Has discretionary authority or responsibility in the administration of a plan; and</li><li> Provides investment advice for a direct or indirect fee with respect to money or property of a plan.6 <br/>  </li><p> The final rule also delineates the types of communications that constitute investment advice or recommendations and the kinds of relationships in which such communications trigger fiduciary investment advice responsibilities. Specifically, a person is providing investment advice if they charge fees or other forms of compensation for giving either:</p><li> Recommendations as to the advisability of acquiring, holding, disposing of or exchanging securities or other investment property; or a recommendation as to how securities or other investment property should be invested after they are rolled over, transferred or distributed from the plan or IRA.</li><li> Recommendations on the management of securities or other investment property, including investment policies or strategies, portfolio composition, selection of other persons to provide investment advice or investment management services, selection of investment account arrangements (e.g., brokerage versus advisory); or recommendations with respect to rollovers, distributions or transfers from a plan or IRA (e.g., advisability, amount, destination, etc.). <br/>  </li><p> In the above, &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; means advisory communications that would reasonably be viewed as a suggestion the recipient take a particular course of action, or not. The more individually tailored the communication, the more likely it will be viewed as a recommendation. (Note: The rule also makes a point of including recommendations by computer software programs as fiduciary communications.)</p><p> Who is NOT an investment advice fiduciary?</p><li> A seller or counterparty who provides an arm&rsquo;s length sale, purchase, loan or bilateral contract between an expert plan investor (ERISA-covered plans in excess of $50 million) and the advisor</li><li> Counterparties to ERISA-covered employee benefit plans in swap and security-based swap transactions</li><li> Employees of plan sponsors, plans or plan fiduciaries</li><li> Registered broker-dealers who execute transactions for the purchase of securities on behalf of a plan or IRA <br/>  </li><p> What is NOT a fiduciary communication?</p><li> General communications and commentaries on investment products (such as financial newsletters)</li><li> Certain activities and communications in connection with marketing or making available a platform of investment alternatives from which a plan fiduciary could choose</li><li> Information and materials that constitute investment education or retirement education (plan information; general financial, investment and retirement information; asset allocation models; interactive investment materials) <br/>  </li><p> It should be noted the final rule allows educational asset allocation models and interactive investment materials to reference specific investment alternatives. This is acceptable as long as they are presented as hypothetical examples to help plan participants and beneficiaries understand the educational information and not as investment recommendations.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  THE EXEMPTIONS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Exemption status has been granted to communications in arm&rsquo;s length transactions with certain plan fiduciaries who are licensed financial professionals (broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, banks, insurance companies, etc.) or plan fiduciaries who have at least $50 million under management. In an important turnabout from the proposed ruling, the final rule also grants exemptions to financial product providers to continue to conduct otherwise ERISA-prohibited transactions under certain circumstances.</p><p> ERISA and the tax code generally prohibit fiduciaries, their agents and representatives from receiving payments from third parties and from acting on conflicts of interest in connection with transactions involving a plan or IRA. The prohibition includes certain types of fees and compensation common in the retail market, such as brokerage or insurance commissions, 12b-1 fees and revenue-sharing payments. Via several important exemptions granted by the final rule, however, these fiduciaries may receive such compensation, subject to protective conditions.</p><p> Accordingly, fiduciary advisors may always give advice without need of an exemption if they avoid the sorts of conflicts of interest that result in prohibited transactions. However, when they choose to give advice in which they have a conflict of interest, they must rely upon an exemption, such as the following.</p><p> <strong>  Best Interest Contract Exemption (BICE) </strong></p><p> The Best Interest Contract Exemption requires financial institutions to acknowledge their fiduciary status and that of their advisors in a written contract and adhere to enforceable standards of fiduciary conduct and fair dealing with respect to their advice. The exemption is broadly written and covers a wide variety of current compensation practices, and permits advisors to receive commissions and other common forms of compensation, provided they safeguard clients against any harmful impact of conflicts of interest on investment advice.</p><p> &ldquo;Level fee&rdquo; fiduciaries who receive a fee only in connection with advisory or investment management services do not have to enter into a contract with retirement investors, but they must provide a written statement of fiduciary status, adhere to standards of fiduciary conduct and prepare written documentation of the reasons for the recommendation.</p><p> <strong>  Class Exemption for Principal Transactions in Certain Assets between Investment Advice Fiduciaries and Employee Benefit Plans and IRAs </strong></p><p> This exemption allows investment advice fiduciaries to engage in purchases and sales of certain investments out of their organization&rsquo;s inventory (i.e., principal transactions). However, the exemption limits the type of investments that may be purchased or sold and mandates that the advisor/institution give the client a written statement acknowledging their fiduciary status and serves as an enforceable contract.</p><p> Under the exemption&rsquo;s terms, there is no requirement to enter into a contract with ERISA plan investors, but the same written acknowledgement of fiduciary status is required. Additionally, advisors must adopt policies and procedures to mitigate any harmful impact of conflicts of interest and must disclose their conflicts of interest to retirement investors.</p><p> Transactions otherwise prohibited under ERISA that can be exempted under the new rule are defined as:</p><li> <strong>  Statutory exemptions: </strong> the acquisition, holding or sale of any investment property as a result of investment advice, provided the investment&rsquo;s fees do not vary based on any investment option selected, or the advisor uses a computer model under an investment advice program meeting ERISA requirements (for example, an electronic execution system designed to match purchases and sales at the best price available, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s applicable rules).</li><li> <strong>  Administrative exemptions: </strong> available to investment advice fiduciaries who are &ldquo;market-makers,&rdquo; this exemption permits principal transactions with broker-dealers and banks only if the broker-dealers and banks do not have or exercise any discretionary authority or control over the investment of plan or IRA assets involved in the transaction and do not render investment advice. <br/>  </li><p> In addition to the exemption documents, the published ruling includes amendments that further clarify terminology and extend exemptions to fiduciary parties in certain, rarer circumstances. For instance, one amendment permits investment advice fiduciaries to receive compensation when they extend credit to plans and IRAs to avoid a failed securities transaction, a situation which would be prohibited under ERISA. You can review all the language in the amendments listed below at federalregister.gov:</p><li> Amendment to and Partial Revocation of Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84-24 for Certain Transactions Involving Insurance Agents and Brokers, Pension Consultants, Insurance Companies, and Investment Company Principal Underwriters</li><li> Amendment to Prohibited Transaction Exemption 75-1, Part V, Exemptions From Prohibitions Respecting Certain Classes of Transactions Involving Employee Benefit Plans and Certain Broker-Dealers, Reporting Dealers and Banks</li><li> Amendments to and Partial Revocation of Prohibited Transaction Exemption 86-128 for Securities Transactions Involving Employee Benefit Plans and Broker-Dealers; Amendment to and Partial Revocation of PTE 75-1, Exemptions From Prohibitions Respecting Certain Banks</li><li> Amendments to Class Exemptions 75-1, 77-4, 80-83 and 83-1</li><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p>  </p><h3> <strong>  WHAT DOES THE NEW FIDUCIARY RULE MEAN FOR THE INDUSTRY? </strong></h3><p> <br/> First, all investors and their advisors should remember that the DOL fiduciary rule only applies to advisors who guide investors in IRAs, 401(k) plans and health savings accounts (HSAs). The DOL has no jurisdiction over personal assets in taxable accounts. Yet, several organizations are taking steps that may signal the eventual migration of all advisory accounts to fee-based from commission-bearing.7</p><p> Regardless what the future brings, the rule presents sweeping changes for the money management industry. Speculation has it that smaller advisory firms currently relying on third-party fees and commissions for the lion&rsquo;s share of their revenue could be heavily affected by the compliance costs. Larger firms, on the other hand, may actually see their bottom line improve as, according to Morningstar, flat annual fee-based compensation can yield at least 60% more revenue than traditional commission-based sales.8</p><p> The DOL estimates compliance costs will total between $10.0 billion and $31.5 billion over 10 years with most of the costs concentrated in satisfying relevant consumer-protective private transaction exemptions (PTEs) for affected fiduciary advisors. The Department&rsquo;s primary 10-year cost estimate of $16.1 billion reflects the present value of $5.0 billion in first-year startup costs and $1.5 billion in subsequent annual costs. Savings from technological innovations and market adjustments may reduce costs. Only time will tell whether costs will be more, due to the natural upheaval any major change to business models can cause.</p><h3> <strong>  WHAT TO DO TO MANAGE THROUGH CHANGE </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Talk to Your Clients </strong></p><p> The expanded definition of fiduciary will begin to be applied in April 2017 and will require you to adhere to the best interest standard and make basic disclosures of conflicts of interest, if any. (The full requirements of the BICE will not go into effect until Jan. 1, 2018.)</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t already done so, start talking with your existing client base. Whether your business model requires major shifts or just a few extra pieces of documentation, make clear what you are doing to comply with the new rule &mdash; and remind your clients of the value you already bring to the relationship while you do it.</p><p> <strong>  Embrace Technology </strong></p><p> A technology-supported workflow system that automates all your customer relationship management actions, communications and personal or electronic contacts can make compliance with the new rule easier and less costly.</p><p> <strong>  Consider Segmenting Your Client Base </strong></p><p> Your practice is probably not homogenous. You may have clients who use commissionable products. Some may be candidates for fee-based services. Others may require you to apply for rare exemptions. Still others may not be quite suitable for your business model under the new rule. Organizing or classifying your book of business will help clarify what steps your firm must take to comply with the new rule. Keep in mind that, while recommendations to existing clients regarding current investments and any systematic purchase agreements in effect are grandfathered, your advice still must satisfy the basic fiduciary standards of best interest and reasonable compensation.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t Hesitate to Ask the DOL </strong></p><p> It is routine for any government body to provide assistance following issuance of highly technical or significant guidance. The DOL is no exception. You&rsquo;ll find detailed compliance assistance at dol.gov, including compliance guides, tips and fact sheets to assist in satisfying ERISA obligations.

The Best Ways to Praise Top Performers","link":"no-more-saying-great-work-the-best-ways-to-praise-top-performers","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> You know praising your employees is important. <br/>  </h3><p> Gallup reported that the number one reason Americans leave their jobs is because they don&rsquo;t feel appreciated at work. Other studies have shown that regular recognition results in 31% lower turnover and 60% higher engagement. Make your employees truly feel appreciated:</p><h3> 1. No more saying &ldquo;great work!&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> An important part of praise is encouraging the rights sorts of behaviors. To do this effectively it&rsquo;s important to be specific about what it was that you liked about their performance so it can then be emulated. No more saying &ldquo;Great work!&rdquo; Instead saying, &ldquo;Your follow-ups and quick response time helped us land this new client,&rdquo; provides much more information for your employee and others to follow.  </p><h3> 2. Challenge them <br/>  </h3><p> The best way to praise your top performers is by offering them new challenges which allow them to use their strengths or develop new skills. Offering stretch assignments or the opportunity to lead a project is a great way to demonstrate your confidence in their abilities. Each time you offer them a new opportunity explain which skills they will be developing and why you think they&rsquo;re the right person to take on the assignment.</p><h3> 3. Teach them how to become future leaders <br/>  </h3><p> One mistake many managers make is that they focus most of their coaching on low performers. Don&rsquo;t neglect your star employees because they&rsquo;re doing well. Instead, it&rsquo;s never too early to start training new leaders. According to Deloitte&rsquo;s 2016 study on millennials, only 24% saw leadership as one of their strongest skills upon graduation. Yet, 63% feel their leadership skills are not being fully developed in the workplace. As Generation X exits the workplace, companies may face a major management gap if they fail to develop their future leaders. What&rsquo;s more, Deloitte reported that 71% of employees who were likely to leave their jobs in the next two years were unsatisfied with how their leadership skills were being developed.</p><h3> 4. Discuss their future goals <br/>  </h3><p> Top performers are more likely to stay with companies where managers take a genuine interest in helping them advance their career. Have a 1-on-1 with your star employees to discuss what their goals are for the future and how you can help them along the way.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 15:43:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 15:43:12.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_TD92SLs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/no-more-saying-great-work-the-best-ways-to-praise-top-performers/\", \"post_id\": \"11888\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 15:43:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 15:43:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"no-more-saying-great-work-the-best-ways-to-praise-top-performers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11887\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5792\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/No-More-Saying-Great-Work-The-Best-Ways-to-Praise-Top-Performers.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"689\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466535600,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}

Accountability? 4 Reasons Why You're Not Being Heard at Work","link":"is-there-a-low-level-of-trust-accountability-4-reasons-why-youre-not-being-heard-at-work","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The manager in the workshop seemed upset that her team wasn&rsquo;t receiving the message she was sending out during a team meeting.</p><p> &ldquo;Listen everyone. We need to be on a call late tonight to get the information from our colleagues in Asia. Without their input, we cannot finish our report which is due at the end of the week.&rdquo;</p><p> The time for the call came and only the manager was on the line. No one else showed up. Once again she was all alone picking up the information. She shared her frustration with the rest of the participants in the program:</p><p> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure it out. Why was I the only one that was on the call? Where was everyone else?&rdquo;</p><p> Something did not add up and we all decided to help her identify why she might be facing these challenges with her team. Why was she not being heard?</p><h3> Here are four reasons why we are not being heard: <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  1.  </strong> <strong>  OUR MESSAGE LACKS URGENCY AND CLARITY </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The first thing that the other participants shared with the manager was that her initial message didn&rsquo;t seem all that important or critical. It also omitted why the data from the call was so necessary for the final report.</p><li> Messages that show purpose and details are more impactful</li><li> Sharing specifics about a timeline can spur others to act</li><li> Choosing words that are clear, direct and simple are more easily heard</li><li> Showing appreciation for staying up late and participating goes a far way</li><h3> <strong>  2. NO ONE FEELS ACCOUNTABLE </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The initial message did little to empower the team members to feel accountable. When directions are spouted out without explaining how each person&rsquo;s contributions impact the completion of a project, no one often steps up. To cultivate accountability leaders help their teams understand the value they each bring and without everyone participating, the end result will not be as rich.</p><h3> <strong>  3. WE ALWAYS PICK UP THE PIECES </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> What was very obvious here was that the manager allowed herself to continually finish the projects if her team fell short. This happens often and team leaders can get into very dangerous habits and patterns of being &ldquo;the completer&rdquo;. A great solution for this is empowering team members not to pass along their work until it is totally finished.  Coaching our teams to show up, be focused and honor their commitments is the sign of great leadership.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  4. THERE IS A LOW LEVEL OF TRUST </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Teams without trust have no foundation to support one another. The manager seemed to have a lack of trust with her team hearing her messages. Her words were not taken seriously or with any concern. To cultivate meaningful relationships and build trust, leaders:</p><li> Get to know their team members&rsquo; interests</li><li> Understand why a late night call may be very difficult for some of their team members due to family issues</li><li> Follow through on what they say they will do</li><li> Create a rotational schedule for late night calls so everyone has a turn and the burden doesn&rsquo;t fall on any one person</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 16:05:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 16:05:07.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_T8ucZPi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-there-a-low-level-of-trust-accountability-4-reasons-why-youre-not-being-heard-at-work/\", \"post_id\": \"11890\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 16:05:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 16:05:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-there-a-low-level-of-trust-accountability-4-reasons-why-youre-not-being-heard-at-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11889\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5793\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Is-There-a-Low-Level-of-Trust-Accountability-4-Reasons-Why-Youre-Not-Being-Heard-at-Work.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"712\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466532000,"author_id":476,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5566,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Art of Communication With Aging Clients","link":"the-art-of-communication-with-aging-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Have you ever had an older client who didn&rsquo;t want anyone, not even family, to know what his assets were? Did you find this secrecy about money to be a problem with a few of these older folks? It&rsquo;s not so rare.</h3><p> <br/> Everyone is entitled to privacy, of course, and the rules mandate that you not share a person&rsquo;s private financial information. But what if your client begins to decline in his health? What if he starts to appear as if he&rsquo;s &ldquo;losing it&rdquo;? Then are you supposed to just let him make mistakes and feel constrained that you can&rsquo;t call a family member or anyone about his health? It does seem that most advisors do nothing until things reach a crisis point.</p><p> As aging experts, we think things should be handled differently. When you open every client file, you are not required to get the name of someone to call in case of emergency or in case of need. That is precisely what needs to change. Let&rsquo;s consider common sense. If people are living longer than ever, their chances of developing cognitive impairment are consequently greater. With impairment, people lose their financial judgment. If you have a client&rsquo;s trusted contact in the file, you may need it. And you can&rsquo;t wait until your client is really, obviously impaired. If you do, she probably won&rsquo;t want to give you anything. That puts you in a bad position. Your client is vulnerable to big mistakes and even to financial abuse. You don&rsquo;t know what to do. You can&rsquo;t call anyone and you wouldn&rsquo;t know who to call even if you could.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the sensible solution:  <strong>  get the names and contact information of two trusted others for your client when you open any file. </strong>  And with existing clients, ask them for the contact for two trusted people in their lives at the next portfolio review. Do it across the board for every single client. That way, when any one of them goes on to develop cognitive impairment, or dementia or has a stroke or anything disabling, you are not caught flat.   And how do you ask that secretive client for the names and for permission to call when, in your judgment, the need arises? You start by making it your problem. You let the client know that it is now office policy. You politely insist and you get it done.</p><p> Not every single client will immediately cooperate. Some will need your patient persuasion and tact to coax them to do this. That is one of those &ldquo; <a href=\"https://youtu.be/87FRQJV8g6U?t=28s\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  soft skills </a> &lsquo; you absolutely need with your older clients. A few may refuse your request and you can&rsquo;t force it on them. But for most clients, the encouragement from you to look to the future may be considered part of your job.</p><p> Senior clients can pose a number of communication issues with you besides being secretive about finances. Hearing loss, vision limitations and mobility issues can all make conversation more difficult.

Part of this phase of life involves learning how to manage money on a daily and monthly basis. What do you think about college students and credit cards? How have you prepared your child for handling credit?</p><h3> College Students and Credit Cards: Educate your Child in Advance</h3><p> <br/> You wouldn&rsquo;t hand your child the keys to your car and expect him or her to know how to drive without getting some instructions first, and you shouldn&rsquo;t expect them to navigate through the world of credit without getting some information about how it works, either. For most students, this is probably their first credit card and so they most likely do not understand things such as interest rates or repayment expectations. This is why they tend to get into trouble.</p><p> Having a credit card as a college or university student is important because a young person can start building their credit rating and learn to develop responsible spending habits. As a parent, you will need to educate your child first before you hand over a card.</p><h3> Set Clear Boundaries Around What the Card is to be Used For</h3><p> <br/> You should have a conversation with your child about acceptable uses for the card. They may include the following:</p><li> Emergencies (you will need to define what constitutes an emergency)</li><li> Basic expenses while living away from home (as agreed to)</li><li> School supplies</li><li> Travel expenses to return home at the end of the semester</li><li> Clothing and personal care items (as agreed to) <br/>  </li><p> If you agree that your child can use the credit card to pay for certain expenses, set a monetary limit per item or per month. You may want to agree that if something comes up and he or she feels that a higher amount needs to be spent, that you will need to be consulted first. That will accomplish two goals: you will have some input into your child&rsquo;s spending habits and your child will get in the habit of stopping to consider a purchase before simply pulling out the credit card and buying something on impulse.</p><p> Avoid allowing the kids to use the card for fun or lifestyle expenses such as eating out with friends, concerts, random travel, excessive shopping on non-essential things. The credit card should be there for basic needs and emergencies. Your child should have a job to pay for these other expenses.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Alternatives to Help Students Avoid or Mitigate Credit Card Costs</h3><p> <br/> To help students get used to using credit cards, start off with a prepaid card. This will let them understand how credit cards work and let them practice using the card responsibly. Once you feel comfortable that your child is mature enough to handle a regular credit card, you can make a switch.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 16:23:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 16:23:46.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_egqJ1oI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/students-and-credit-cards-how-to-teach-them-how-to-be-responsible-with-credit/\", \"post_id\": \"11896\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 16:23:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 16:23:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"students-and-credit-cards-how-to-teach-them-how-to-be-responsible-with-credit\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11895\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5796\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Students-and-Credit-Cards-How-to-Teach-Them-How-to-be-Responsible-with-Credit.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"736\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466521200,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5569,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Things Ridiculously Successful Salespeople Do Every Day","link":"10-things-ridiculously-successful-salespeople-do-every-day","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s very unusual for a top sales producer at a company to not be a top producer after switching companies. It&rsquo;s also not mere coincidence. The best salespeople may each arrive at their goals in a unique way, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that they tend to share similar characteristics and habits.</p><p> Spiro was designed to help you make more money in sales by spending less time entering data,  <a href=\"https://spirohq.com/home/sales-assistant/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  predicting what actions </a>  will yield the best results, and helping you stay motivated and entertained throughout the day, but it&rsquo;s up to you to do the actual selling. Here are the ten things that successful salespeople do every day:</p><h3> <strong>  1. They keep moving forward </strong></h3><p> <br/> The best sales reps don&rsquo;t stop and celebrate every little success since they know that consistent effort is the only thing that will make them a lot of money. Successful salespeople move forward no matter what happens, good or bad.</p><h3> <strong>  2. They focus on one person at a time </strong></h3><p> <br/> The best salespeople make sure that whoever they&rsquo;re talking to gets their absolute undivided attention. They don&rsquo;t rush to get off the phone with a prospect, or move onto the next deal until they&rsquo;ve made the person in front of them feel like they&rsquo;ve been heard.</p><h3> <strong>  3. They plan their day </strong></h3><p> <br/> Successful salespeople usually don&rsquo;t come into the office and wing it, they have a process for what they do each day. Of course sales is full of surprises and nothing ever truly goes according to plan, but the foundation for success is built on structure.</p><h3> <strong>  4. They look for opportunities everywhere </strong></h3><p> <br/> The best salespeople know that opportunities are found outside of normal lead sources, and look for them wherever they exist. They know that relying on standard methods of prospecting and will get standard results and adjust accordingly.</p><h3> <strong>  5. They see the upside </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re easily dejected and have a hard time seeing the positive in every situation, you will have a hard time being ridiculously successful. The cream of the crop focus on opportunities, not obstacles, and always think their best days are around the corner.</p><h3> <strong>  6. They learn from their mistakes </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sales managers are fond of saying &ldquo;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results.&rdquo; The best salespeople know this, and never make the same mistake twice. If the pitch doesn&rsquo;t work, they adjust it. If the leads are bad, they adjust the lead source.</p><h3> <strong>  7. They focus only on what matters </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the hardest things anyone in business will decide is what to spend their time and attention on.  <a href=\"https://spirohq.com/home/sales-assistant/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Spiro can help you decide what actions to take to be successful </a> , and the best salespeople only spend time doing things that get them closer to their goals. They don&rsquo;t waste time with unqualified prospects, and don&rsquo;t procrastinate, they only focus on what matters.</p><h3> <strong>  8. They make time for themselves </strong></h3><p> <br/> A common misconception among salespeople is that 100% of your waking hours should be spent working. This is both absurd and counterproductive. If you&rsquo;re not well-rested and don&rsquo;t give yourself time to unwind, you&rsquo;ll simply burn out and won&rsquo;t be doing yourself or your sales goals any favors. Get enough sleep and enough downtime and you&rsquo;ll be more productive, it&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  9. They set daily goals  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Everyone in sales sets monthly or quarterly goals (management sure does) but the best salespeople break those down into smaller daily and sometimes even hourly goals. This simplifies the goals and makes the bigger ones more attainable.</p><h3> <strong>  10. They ask themselves how they can help their customers  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Successful salespeople have figured out how to keep the most important question a salesperson can possibly understand in their mind at all times: How can I help my customer? Once that question drives all of your behavior as a salesperson, you will have taken the biggest step to mastering sales.</p><h3>  </h3>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 16:41:19.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 16:41:19.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_3SC82Ma.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-things-ridiculously-successful-salespeople-do-every-day/\", \"post_id\": \"11898\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 16:41:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 16:41:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-things-ridiculously-successful-salespeople-do-every-day\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11897\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5797\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10-Things-Ridiculously-Successful-Salespeople-Do-Every-Day.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1443\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466499600,"author_id":2,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5570,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Meeting Disruption Head On in the Financial Services PR World","link":"meeting-disruption-head-on-in-the-financial-services-pr-world","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/author/katy-lithgow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Katy Lithgow </a> Disruption has surely established itself as the buzzword of 2016, and the publishing sector has not been untouched by the so-called digital revolution. <a href=\"/sell/marketing/financial-services-pr-in-the-new-world-order-and-why-you-need-to-care\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Last week </a>  we looked at how newsroom cuts, robo-journalism, new broadcasting models and changes to organisational structures could uproot your best-laid PR plan.So is it time to throw in the proverbial PR towel and start learning how to code a WordPress blog? Before you do, you should consider innovating your communications plan:</p><h3> 1) Do your research</h3>Give journalists all the necessary evidence to help them manage their increasingly stretched resources. This means a good pitch with clear, factual evidence. More than ever, journalists don&rsquo;t have the time to research or clarify so a well-presented media release or pitch will save them the hassle and help you to position yourself as a trusted source.   Don&rsquo;t forget the importance of making sure that all material you send to journalists is digital first (you surely have been doing this for years, right?). Embed URLs, images and other multimedia into your financial PR piece to get the attention of journalists.<h3> 2) The importance of the trades</h3>The financial services trade media is going strong. While many outlets have switched to digital-first or digital-only, trade publications remain a trusted source for financial services content. Don&rsquo;t underestimate them when preparing your pitch, and be sure to build these relationships by always providing quality content. This should include exclusive insights that matter to the trade&rsquo;s specific area.<h3> 3) New platforms; new influencers</h3>So where are those journalists that lost their jobs due to publishing cut backs? Some of them have created new digital publishing ventures outside the realm of traditional media companies. While these journalists are likely to experience the same challenges as their former employers &ndash; largely how to monetize their content &ndash; there will undoubtedly be new opportunities to form relationships with these experienced players and contribute valued thought-leadership content.Get to know the interests of these players: their new found independence will mean understanding what makes them tick should be fundamental to your pitch. (Tip: Watch their social activity and stay across their publications before reaching out.)##TRENDING##<h3> 4) Get on the wires</h3>Other journalists are moving to the news wires and these relationships are important for your communications planning. As we noted last week, the major metros will be drawing more content from the wires, so your relationships with journalists at Bloomberg, AAP and the like should continue to be a part of your media relations strategy.<h3> 5) Turbocharge your PR</h3>Job done now you&rsquo;ve secured your coverage or created your own thought leadership? Nope, time to amplify it.In next week&rsquo;s blog we&rsquo;ll provide tips on how you can achieve even greater results (and eyeballs) for your PR by leveraging influencers, content marketing and digital innovations in your plan.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 16:45:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 16:45:16.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_G6LYmwl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/meeting-disruption-head-on-in-the-financial-services-pr-world/\", \"post_id\": \"11900\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 16:45:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 16:45:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"meeting-disruption-head-on-in-the-financial-services-pr-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11899\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5798\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Meeting-Disruption-Head-On-in-the-Financial-Services-PR-World.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"680\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466503200,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

As newsletters are now an opt-in form of digital marketing, they are the perfect medium for pushing out content to your target audience without being disruptive.</p><p> The Content Marketing Institute found that 78% of respondents included newsletters in their content marketing strategy. With newsletters being the primary use of email marketing ( <a href=\"http://blog.capterra.com/statistics-email-marketing-not-dead/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Capterra </a> ), taking advantage of this marketing tool can lead your business to further success.</p><p> So, why newsletters? As a powerful marketing tool, newsletters can:</p><li> Increase your web traffic</li><li> Increase your repeat visitors</li><li> Allows you to track who&rsquo;s receiving, opening, and visiting your website</li><li> Educates your target audience</li><li> Nurtures your leads</li><li> Builds trust with your clients and prospects</li><p> Just like anything in digital marketing, newsletters are not a one-size-fits-all approach. There are 3 different types of eNewsletters that marketers typically use, each with a different purpose.</p><p> <strong>  Corporate eNewsletters </strong></p><p> They are designed to keep customers and prospects up-to-date with organization updates. They summarize company announcements, press releases, new products, etc. This type of newsletter is typically sent on a monthly or quarterly basis.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Awareness-Interest-Decision-Action.png\" width=\"300\"/></p><h3> Lead Nurturing Newsletters <br/>  </h3><p> The goal of this type of eNewsletter is to engage, inform, and stay top of mind for clients and prospects. The content you share with your audience can lead them through the awareness, consideration, and decision phases by providing them with useful content, familiarizing them with your business and, eventually, driving them to take action and become a client. Content within the eNewsletter can include educational materials such as blogs, sales information, and marketing offers. Depending on where your audience may be along the sales funnel, having a call-to-action may push those at the decision making phase to commit and become your client.</p><p> The goal of this type of eNewsletter is to engage and influence prospects with every interaction they have with you.

This type of eNewsletter is a mixture of syndicated (third party) and original content. It displays that you have a grasp of what your audience is looking for by surfacing the best content out there into a  one stop shop.  This is also a great approach for Advisors with a limited amount of content.</p><p> Lead nurturing and curated newsletters tend to have higher open rates, and are generally sent on a weekly basis, at the same day and time (ex. 2:30 pm every Tuesday).</p><p> An effective eNewsletter is non-intrusive, provides value to the reader, and makes them feel like they are being educated rather than sold. eNewsletters don&rsquo;t require you to create new content as they&rsquo;re a great way to repurpose your old content. As a Financial Advisor, you should take advantage of this effective means for building and maintaining relationships with clients and prospects. eNewsletters will not only extend the reach of your content, but can also do wonders for your business.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 16:55:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 16:55:23.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_6Ln8Atd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-forgotten-hero-of-content-marketing-email-newsletters/\", \"post_id\": \"11903\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 16:55:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 16:55:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-forgotten-hero-of-content-marketing-email-newsletters\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11901\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5799\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Forgotten-Hero-of-Content-Marketing-Email-Newsletters.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1045\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466499600,"author_id":195,"chart_url":""}

In a community not far from me in Central Florida, innocent men and women entered a business not expecting to run out in horror, be carried out in pain, or not walk out at all.</p><p> The media will spotlight the human suffering and try to understand the psychology of the shooter.  Politicians will squabble about ways to mitigate future attacks and security experts will tell us how to make our businesses safer. But what about taking a moment with our teams and talking about the importance of caring and compassion?</p><p> None of us knows how long we will have to be in service to others, nor do we know the back story of each person we are about to serve.   Typically, we don&rsquo;t know if the next customer has suffered a recent tragedy, is distressed by health or financial difficulties, or feels unaccepted by others.  What we do know, is that we have the power in every human interaction to provide service!  By that I mean we can offer others:</p><li> A Warm Welcome</li><li> An Eagerness to be of Assistance</li><li> Attentive Listening</li><li> Considerate and Compassionate Care, and</li><li> Sincere Gratitude. <br/>  </li><p> Kindness and excellence in human service, will not stop those hellbent on destroying others but it is a claim to our personal power.  True service is a constructive force that leaders can offer to their team members and a gift frontline workers can provide for those who entrust us with their business.</p><p> During the wake of this most recent tragedy, I reflected back to a Starbucks customer I spoke to while writing my second book about the company (Leading the Starbucks Way).  When I asked that young, burly man about why he visits Starbucks on a daily basis, he unexpectedly began to cry and said, &ldquo;I get bullied at work and struggle to go back in to my job each day after lunch.  I come to Starbucks for a coffee during my lunch break BECAUSE THEY ARE NICE TO ME and I feel able to get through the afternoon at work.&rdquo; </p><p> I remember wishing I could make his workplace more pleasant or help him find a kinder work environment.  I also remember appreciating how leadership and the baristas at his Starbucks took the time to be &ldquo;NICE&rdquo; to him &ndash; thus providing a respite from the challenges he faced.</p><h3> When the world becomes harsh, violent, and angry &ndash; shouldn&rsquo;t we INCREASE our commitment to service?</h3>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-20 16:58:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-20 16:58:47.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_7l3LBtm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/countering-terror-with-a-service-heart/\", \"post_id\": \"11905\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-20 16:58:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-20 16:58:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"countering-terror-with-a-service-heart\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11904\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5800\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Countering-Terror-with-a-Service-Heart.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"707\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466524800,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5573,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Ten Ways Salespeople Can Crush Social Selling","link":"ten-ways-salespeople-can-crush-social-selling","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitedesk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mike Ciccolella </a>  | KiteDesk</p><p> Social selling techniques and activities will help you drastically improve and warm up connections, emails, LinkedIn InMails, Twitter DMs, videos, and phone calls. Try these 10 strategies and see your results improve:</p><p> <strong>  1. Build your personal brand and optimize your digital profiles on major social networks. </strong>  Own your online reputation. For example, see The Ultimate Cheat Sheet for LinkedIn [Infographic] by  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kokasexton\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Koka Sexton </a> . To increase your connect-and-response rates, you need to represent yourself accurately as a credible authority, resource, and trusted advisor. Furthermore, buyers trust peer recommendations&mdash;so ask folks who know your work to endorse you online. The &ldquo;social proof&rdquo; of what others say about you is more impressive than what you say about yourself.</p><p> <strong>  2. Do research to gain insightful business intelligence on your target prospects and organizations via their Websites </strong> , About Us pages, biographies, press/news pages, blogs, annual reports, etc.</p><p> <strong>  3. Set up   <a href=\"https://www.google.com/alerts\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Alerts  </a>   in order to be on top of industry </strong> , organization, and prospect trigger events such as new funding, growth, job changes, relocations, new hires, new product and/or service launches, etc.</p><p> <strong>  4. Do more research, reading, and listening. </strong>  Follow and engage with your prospects and organizations on their preferred social media channels such as LinkedIn, LinkedIn Groups, Twitter, Quora, Google+, Facebook, YouTube, and other vertical-specific forums. Get familiar with their interests and personalities. Interact, vote their answers up, thoughtfully comment, and share their content as appropriate.</p><p> <strong>  5. Tactfully leverage shared network connections, influencers, and relationships to gain introductions to prospects </strong> . In relation to asking for help, always be giving and generous with your time. Pay it forward and help others with no expectations.</p><p> <strong>  6. Warmly, politely, and genuinely compliment or congratulate a prospect&rsquo;s organization </strong> , strategy, product, or service via email, LinkedIn InMail, Twitter DM, direct mail, video, phone message, or live call. To capture attention in seconds, demonstrate that you&rsquo;ve done your homework on them and their organization by dropping cogent data points.</p><p> <strong>  7. Educate prospects by sharing content relevant to them that you </strong> , others in your organization, or even someone outside your organization created. Provide value and help your suspect contacts improve. For more tips when leveraging your own organization&rsquo;s demand generation content  see my post, 7 Tips for More Effective B2B Demand Generation, Lead Generation, Marketing, &amp; Sales.</p><p> <strong>  8. Navigate organizational hierarchies and create allies along the way. </strong>  Communicate with prospects and their staff to gain more business intelligence and advice on how to influence, build trust, and be relevant to the primary decision maker or committee.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> <strong>  9. Ask people you meet </strong> (or have meaningful phone conversations with) to connect on digital networks with personalized requests. Don&rsquo;t use the standard generic request to connect; write a personal note.</p><p> <strong>  10. Social Selling isn&rsquo;t only about prospecting or lead generation at the top of the sales funnel.  </strong> Social selling should be used during every single stage of the sales cycle and even after a customer relationship is well established. Continue to educate, advise, and be a resource throughout the buyer&rsquo;s journey.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 15:00:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 15:00:58.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_KbucwyH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ten-ways-salespeople-can-crush-social-selling/\", \"post_id\": \"11907\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 15:00:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 15:00:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ten-ways-salespeople-can-crush-social-selling\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11906\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5801\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ten-Ways-Salespeople-Can-Crush-Social-Selling.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"431\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466596800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5574,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Ready for the Big How-To Secret of Making Life Interesting Again?","link":"ready-for-the-big-how-to-secret-of-making-life-interesting-again","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We&rsquo;re having a big party in a few weeks with friends and family in America during one of our annual visits.</p><p> For the past 12 months, I&rsquo;ve been obsessing over the details which are a challenge given that I live roughly 10,500 miles away (16,900 km). This week I finalized one of the hardest parts, the seating chart, and decided to make life interesting.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of putting together an event seating chart, you&rsquo;ll know that it&rsquo;s not a fun task.</p><p> You&rsquo;re juggling colleagues, friends, family, and kids and trying to put them with the people who they know and love so they can have a good time. G-d forbid they should sit with someone they&rsquo;re not related to, work with and haven&rsquo;t known forever.</p><p> What would happen?</p><p> Chaos?</p><p> Chairs being thrown to the floor as people stomp out the door screaming:</p><p> &ldquo;Next time freaking seat me with people I know!&rdquo;</p><p> I tried to stay within the lines. I did. Then I took a step back and looked at my masterful design.</p><p> It worked. Everyone could comfortably stay in their own solar system.</p><p> We all love that right?</p><p> Trump enthusiasts can&rsquo;t talk to Clinton supporters.</p><p> People who blame the parents for the gorilla who was shot can&rsquo;t even look at the people who think that the parents are not to blame.</p><p> I believe THIS and love people who believe it too.</p><p> Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe what I believe is not only wrong but also a moron.</p><p> &hellip; but how interesting is that?</p><h3> Imagine: <br/>  </h3><p> I love the color blue!</p><p> Oh my gosh!  I love blue too!</p><p> Did you see when blue looks aqua in just the right light?</p><p> Totally and when it looks like the darkest ocean depths &ndash; amazing.</p><p> Right?</p><p> Right!</p><h3> Worse:  <br/>  </h3><p> I love the color blue!</p><p> Oh my gosh! You do? I&rsquo;m an orange fan.</p><p> Orange?</p><p> *chirp, chirp* (&lt;&lt; crickets)</p><p> Can you please pass the salt?</p><p> Oy! Talk about boring. Raise your hand if you want to be seated at either one of those tables. Any takers? What happened to being able to engage and co-exist?</p><p> What happened to leading with curiosity instead of righteousness? We all like to run in our circles, but something happens when circles collide- we discover that we&rsquo;re living more of a Venn diagram and not so alone in the universe.</p><h3> Ready for the big how-to secret of how to make life interesting again? <br/>  </h3><p> Intentionally mush things (and people) up. There ya go.</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with a Venn diagram, it&rsquo;s a way to map two different concepts (or sets of beliefs) and find where they overlap and have something in common.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Apples-Oranges.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></p><p> When I stay on my side, and you on yours, it gets kinda stale; predictable. On top of it &ndash; we miss out on finding those points of connection.</p><p> I decided to do something crazy to my seating chart and put people together who don&rsquo;t know each other. I wanted to give people a chance to discover their living Venn. No, I didn&rsquo;t go crazy and seat my parents with my husband&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s young children but did create pockets of opportunity for new relationships to form.</p><p> What about you?</p><p> On Facebook does every one of your friends reflect your viewpoints?</p><p> At family dinner, are there topics that are off limits because people will start to defend so loudly nothing could be heard or understood above the cacophony?</p><p> How do we break up our circles of sameness? There is no master seating chart that someone&rsquo;s manipulating behind the scenes.</p><p> I often see the advice listen more, talk less as a way to build relationships but hard to do &ndash; especially when your blood is boiling.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s replace listen more, talk less with the following four words: <br/>  </h3><p> Be curious, remain open.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t sweat it if you&rsquo;re worried that means remaining open to being converted, it doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s openness to understanding that transforms who we are and our relationships. As long as the curiosity and openness have respect leading the charge, we&rsquo;re good.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the thing &ndash; to be curious and remain open that means that you need to put yourself in situations where there&rsquo;s difference. Constantly confirming mutual brilliance becomes conforming acceptance. The world becomes black and white and the only color is put in after the fact.  Boooorrrrinnnngg.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> We all want to live a life of meaning, to be known. On the flip side, nobody wants others to go running in the opposite direction when they discover how we really feel and what we truly believe.</p><p> Open mind, my friends, open mind. </p><p> Not everyone you meet will be your BFF, but you can still be curious about what makes them tick. I&rsquo;ve recently been shocked that some people I adore support a candidate different from my choice for President of the United States. Does it make me hate them, ignore them or freeze them out? No &ndash; it makes me curious.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re coming to our party next month, get ready to mash-up out of your comfort zone. If you&rsquo;re not coming, I&rsquo;ll let you know how my seating experiment goes.</p><p> When was the last time you sat down to talk with people and took the time to discover who they are and not only who they appear to be?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 15:03:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 15:03:14.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_3VE3Jkc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ready-for-the-big-how-to-secret-of-making-life-interesting-again/\", \"post_id\": \"11910\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 15:03:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 15:03:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ready-for-the-big-how-to-secret-of-making-life-interesting-again\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11908\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5802\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ready-for-the-Big-How-To-Secret-of-Making-Life-Interesting-Again_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"733\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466607600,"author_id":15,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5575,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Eleven Reasons Advisors Don't Have a Succession Plan","link":"eleven-reasons-advisors-dont-have-a-succession-plan","source_link":null,"content":"<p> All of us who work with business owners have heard the excuses owners use to put off doing the things that they know they should do but just don&rsquo;t see as pressing. Whether you are a CPA, attorney, financial advisor, valuation analyst or any other type of professional, you&rsquo;ve made important and timely recommendations only to have owners agree in theory, but not in action.</p><p> As Exit Planners, we too run into &ldquo;Inert Owners,&rdquo; but we understand the reasons owners fail to act and have tools to move owners to act in their best interests. In this article, we outline the three principle owner responses to Exit Planning in no particular order.</p><p> <strong>  Category I </strong> : They simply don&rsquo;t want to create an Exit Plan.</p><p> <strong>  Category II </strong> : They have no urgency to create an Exit Plan because of one or more false assumptions they&rsquo;ve made.</p><p> <strong>  Category III </strong> :  They don&rsquo;t know how Exit Planning works.</p><h3> <strong>  I.  Thank You, But No Thank You </strong></h3><p> <br/> Owners who simply don&rsquo;t want to create Exit Plans fall into two categories:</p><p> <strong>  Reason 1 </strong> : Those who fear the unknown.</p><p> <strong>  Reason 2 </strong> : Those who do not want to retire.</p><p> In the first category, we find owners who don&rsquo;t know who they&rsquo;d be if not the owner/manager/hub of their company.  Others don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;d do with their time if they couldn&rsquo;t fill their days as they do today.</p><p> In the second category are owners who truly love what they are doing and, no matter how much someone offered to pay for the company, they&rsquo;d still come to work every day.  We also find those who simply cannot imagine anyone else doing a better job managing their company.  Most of the owners in this category, however, are those who are making more money from their company than they can from any other type of investment.</p><h3> <strong>  II.  False Assumptions Suck The Urgency Out Of Owners </strong>       </h3><p> <br/> Here again there are two categories not of owners, but of assumptions.  The first set of poor assumptions relate to time, the second to dollars.</p><p> <strong>  Time-related False Assumptions </strong></p><p> <strong>  Reason 3 </strong> : The most common mistake owners make in thinking about their future exits is that they assume that when they are ready to go, their business will be ready for them to go as well. We could write a book about the errors in that theory; in fact, we have&mdash;John Brown&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.exitplanning.com/definitiveguide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Exit Planning: The Definitive Guide </a> .</p><p> <strong>  Reason 4 </strong> : Related to that assumption is the optimistic view most owners have of the time it will take for their businesses to grow to the amount of cash flow and value that can support their post-exit lives.</p><p> <strong>  Reason 5 </strong> :  Owners underestimate the number of years they (and their spouses) will live after the day they leave their companies. </p><p> <strong>  Dollar-related False Assumptions </strong></p><p> The natural optimism of owners is evident in the assumptions (all of them false) that they make about money. Specifically, they:</p><li> Underestimate the amount of income they&rsquo;ll need to sustain comfortable retirement ( <strong>  Reason 6 </strong> ).</li><li> Overestimate the likely return on their invested assets ( <strong>  Reason 7 </strong> ).</li><li> Overestimate the value of their companies ( <strong>  Reason 8 </strong> ).</li><li> Overestimate the net proceeds from sale/transfer of their companies ( <strong>  Reason 9 </strong> ).</li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  III.  What The Heck Is Exit Planning? </strong></h3><p> <br/> In this last group, we find those who either:</p><li> Don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s an organized, owner-centric, proven process to help them reach financial security and all their other goals ( <strong>  Reason 10 </strong> ); or</li><li> Don&rsquo;t know that there are professional experts who can help them without pushing them toward one exit path ( <strong>  Reason 11 </strong> ). <br/>  </li><p> Those are eleven reasons why an owner may not move forward with planning&mdash;when you know they should. To encourage owners to overcome fears and false assumptions and take action, we&rsquo;ve found that the best, and usually the only, successful strategy is to provide owners, on a consistent basis, accurate, useful information on Exit Planning.  The information that you provide over time&mdash;this is not a one-time conversation&mdash;must convey that planning with you improves the odds of reaching their goals, decreases the time they will spend spinning their wheels and will give them more time to do the things they enjoy.</p><p> As an advisor interested in helping owners achieve their goals and aspirations, you can wait for owners to pick up the phone and call you for assistance. Or, you can launch and maintain an information campaign&mdash;some would call this a marketing campaign&mdash;to foster awareness of owner-centric Exit Planning. Without effective content-based marketing and engagement tools your ability to get owners to move off the dime is challenging at best.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 15:05:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 15:05:56.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_yYbePHn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/eleven-reasons-advisors-dont-have-a-succession-plan/\", \"post_id\": \"11912\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 15:05:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 15:05:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"eleven-reasons-advisors-dont-have-a-succession-plan\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11911\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5803\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Eleven-Reasons-Advisors-Dont-Have-a-Succession-Plan.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"667\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466614920,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5576,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"One Cool Tool for Being a Better Boss","link":"one-cool-tool-for-being-a-better-boss","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Consider colleague feedback I collected from a client's team several years ago: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get the impression he&rsquo;s aware of how he comes across to others,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s tuned in to how harsh or dismissive he can be.&rdquo;</p><p> It's normal to hear doubts from my client when I share this type of feedback. We discuss the notion that a leader doesn't have to win any popularity contests, but it's key not to act in ways that discourage your team from doing their best.  Be cavalier about how you come across, and, over time, you shut people down.  The good news: It&rsquo;s avoidable&mdash;no one I know wants to dishearten their people.</p><p> Once my client takes in the feedback they will ask, &ldquo;Okay, so what can I do about it?&rdquo;</p><p> First, consider three points of view</p><p> Imagine three points of view we can take when in conversation with others, much like an author's narrative perspective (e.g., first person, second person, and third person):</p><p> First Position: My own point of view&mdash;my ideas, questions, and opinions. For example, &ldquo;I think you should do X,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident this project is going to complete on time,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You need to revise that projection.&rdquo; When our own expertise or opinion is called upon, or our ego gets the upper hand, or we need to &ldquo;prove ourselves,&rdquo; then we take the first position point of view. First, position may be summarized as &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about me.&rdquo;</p><p> Second Position: I take your point of view&mdash;try to see the world through your eyeballs&ndash;your ideas, questions, and opinions. For example, &ldquo;I can see you think I should do X,&rdquo; and &ldquo;If I were you, I may be worried about that project.&rdquo; To negotiate effectively, deal with an opposing view, or simply empathize with another, taking a second position is a powerful tool. Second position may be summarized as, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about you.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Third Position: I take the observer point of view, like a satellite hovering overhead, watching me interacting with you.  I&rsquo;m asking myself, &ldquo;What needs to happen?&rdquo; and adjusting my actions and words to draw out your best. For example: &ldquo;I was dismissive with him, and need to acknowledge that&rdquo; and &ldquo;I should stay quiet here; that will encourage my team to figure this out for themselves.&rdquo; Third, position may be summarized as, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about how I impact you.&rdquo;</p><p> Next, here's how you can practice a solution.</p><p> Leaders who have an unintentional discouraging or negative impact on others, be it minor or more major, tend to overuse first position, and avoid third position.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Here&rsquo;s my suggested Third Position practice: In several upcoming meetings and one on one discussions, take a small piece of your attention, and (metaphorically) float it in the air above the room like a satellite for the duration of the meeting.  Imagine it&rsquo;s observer-you &hellip; watching you, the other(s), and your impact on them.   As you do this, silently ask yourself three questions:</p><li> What most needs to happen in this discussion?</li><li> How am I helping&mdash;or getting in the way&mdash;of that?</li><li> How should I adjust what I&rsquo;m saying and doing to draw out their absolute best?</li><p> Ask yourself these questions and adjust how you participate once or twice during the discussion.  Your answers may be to say less, say more, read others more carefully, ask different questions, etc. Try again in the next meeting.</p><p> Keep at it!</p><p> Just like any new mindset or behavior, it takes practice.  You will lose awareness of it, try again, regain it, etc.  Keep at it!  When new to it, my clients say it&rsquo;s like learning a new language&mdash;exhausting and headache-inducing.</p><p> To find and maintain your best impact on others is leadership at its best.  You will be surprised by what you discover&mdash;and do differently&mdash;from the third, or observer, position. Many former clients have told me that learning to use third position deliberately was an extraordinary upgrade to their leadership, one which I hope you will find equally useful.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 15:20:31.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 15:20:31.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_zfxupyQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/one-cool-tool-for-being-a-better-boss/\", \"post_id\": \"11914\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 15:20:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 15:20:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"one-cool-tool-for-being-a-better-boss\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11913\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5804\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/One-Cool-Tool-for-Being-a-Better-Boss.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"801\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466600400,"author_id":131,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5578,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Secrets to Unleashing the Power of Your Financial Technology","link":"4-secrets-to-unleashing-the-power-of-your-financial-technology","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Technology is becoming increasingly important to advisors. A study conducted by Fidelity found that 77% of high-performing advisors believe technology is a key component of their firm&rsquo;s success.</p><p> For those already using technology and those looking to implement technology, learning how to maximize the benefit of that technology is crucial.</p><p> This guide will teach you how to make the most of your firm&rsquo;s technology.</p><h3> <strong>  What is financial technology? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Financial technology (known as &ldquo;fintech&rdquo; for short) is software which automates workflows, making your work day more efficient. There are hundreds of financial technology solutions on the market and many of these solutions were made specifically for advisors. Fintech can help streamline many of your day-to-day tasks like:</p><li> Data aggregation</li><li> Performance reporting</li><li> New-client onboarding</li><li> Account management</li><li> Billing</li><li> Sales management</li><li> Client Communication</li><li> Compliance</li><li> Investment Research <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Benefits of Financial Technology </strong></h3><p> <br/> Financial technology can provide your firm many benefits including:</p><li> Increase efficiency</li><li> Enhance client experience</li><li> Grow your business <br/>  </li><p> The rest of this guide is dedicated to showing you ways to maximize the benefits of your fintech!</p><h3> <strong>  Pick the Right Technology </strong></h3><p> <br/> The first step to maximizing the potential of your financial technology to pick the right technology. Much thought and consideration should go into choosing a technology solution for your firm. Rather than rushing to implement a new solution, take the time to consider the following:</p><p> Examine your industry and consider:</p><li> What is becoming more popular in my industry? What practices are dying out?</li><li> What are some long-term trends I expect?</li><li> Based on changing trends, is there a way I could use technology to create new opportunities? <br/>  </li><p> Think about your clients and ask yourself:</p><li> What types of clients do I work with?</li><li> Who is my ideal client?</li><li> Are there any types of clients I&rsquo;m not currently working with but should be?</li><li> Could I use technology to attract more of this type of client?</li><li> Could I use to technology to enhance the service I provide clients, opening up new market opportunities?</li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Finally, consider:</p><li> Could I use technology to make myself more competitive against other advisors?</li><li> Could I use technology to change how I serve my clients?</li><li> Could I use technology to redefine my client&rsquo;s experience? <br/>  </li><p> When considering which tech solution to buy, you should determine which tasks can be automated. A helpful practice is to:</p><li> Write a list of all the day-to-day tasks you and your team members do</li><li> Identify the business purpose of each task</li><li> Determine which tasks could be digitized to increase efficiency <br/>  </li><p> If you are purposeful about the way you select your technology, it will be more effective.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Get Everyone On Board </strong></h3><p> <br/> When implementing new technology, always remember to put people first and technology second. If your staff isn&rsquo;t on board with the tech changes, it&rsquo;s unlikely they will maximize the benefits of your chosen solution. To make sure everyone is on board, there are two major steps you can take:</p><li> Discuss the big picture</li><li> Provide additional support <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Discuss the Big Picture </strong></p><p> Make sure that your long-term vision for your firm in clear to all employees.  If it is, new technology will be more widely accepted by your team.</p><p> Take some time to speak with your whole team and express to them what your vision for the firm is. Explain how technology will play a key role in achieving that vision. If employees understand the role technology plays in the success of your firm, they will embrace it.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t forget to mention the many benefits technology will bring your firm. Get employees on board by discussing all the time-savings new tech will bring to their work days!</p><p> <strong>  Provide Additional Support </strong></p><p> Don't forget that some employees are less tech-savvy than others. Providing extra support can help these employees get the most out of a technology solution. This can be as easy as giving them the name and contact information for a dedicated solution specialist. Or, as simple as sending out an FAQ for your new technology to everyone&rsquo;s email. There are many ways to give employees a little extra help when they need it.</p><h3> <strong>  Understand the Technology </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are many things you can do to better understand your new technology, some include:</p><li> Leverage your solution&rsquo;s customer support team</li><li> Read resource guides, FAQs, and How-Tos</li><li> Watch tutorial videos</li><li> Schedule a product demo (and ask questions during it!)</li><li> Reach out to your tech provider to establish a point-person to answer questions <br/>  </li><p> If your solution doesn&rsquo;t provide support tools like FAQs, video tutorials, and dedicated customer service representatives, then it may not be a very good tech solution. Any high-quality tech solution should offer equally high-quality technical support. If it doesn't, you may want to reconsider that solution.</p><h3> <strong>  Measure and Optimize </strong></h3><p> <br/> Reaping the maximum benefit out of you tech doesn&rsquo;t end when you master it. Measuring the impact of your tech on your firm&rsquo;s performance is important too. To measure your technology&rsquo;s performance, consider the following:</p><li> User-impact (How is this benefiting my employees?)</li><li> End user-impact (How is this enhancing my client&rsquo;s experience?)</li><li> ROI metrics (How much has our efficiency increased since implementing this technology?) <br/>  </li><p> When determining ROI metrics, compare how much time you spent on &ldquo;x&rdquo; task before with how much time you spend on &ldquo;x&rdquo; task now.</p><p> Be critical and determine areas where you tech isn&rsquo;t meeting your initial expectations. Discuss your findings with your tech provider and ask how they can help improve the efficiency of your technology.

Schwab executive Susan Forman told  InvestmentNews : &ldquo;This campaign is, in part, an effort to break through the confusion that exists among many investors about the difference between traditional advice models and the independent financial adviser,\" according to the  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20160616/FREE/160619940/barrage-of-schwab-ads-to-proclaim-virtues-of-fiduciary-advisers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  article </a> .</p><p> It looks like a terrific campaign by Schwab, and one that will go mainstream, like John Oliver's video about his firm's experience with a 401(k). The 21 minute video already has 3.3 MILLION views!</p><p> Fiduciary advice is going mainstream and  <strong>  this is historically great for investors </strong> . It will enable retirement investors to accumulate much, much more in their nest eggs without having non-fiduciaries siphon off easily half, or two-thirds as the video notes, of retirees' hard-earned savings. </p><p> But it goes much further than that. Most financial intermediaries, across all financial services models, want to put investor client's interests first, according to four years of fi360 Fiduciary  <a href=\"http://www.fi360.com/uploads/media/2015fiduciarysurvey.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  survey results </a> . The majority of these intermediaries support the DOL's fiduciary requirements and also believe that advice on rollovers from IRA accounts should be fiduciary - in the investor's best interest.</p><p> But the many intermediaries (not required to be fiduciary) who have worked to put their clients' best interest first, while in the brokerage and insurance models, have had to swim upstream in a world where products are larded with commissions and fees, up-front and ongoing. These intermediaries are ranked on production -- how much they sell and how much revenue they bring into the firm and for themselves. They're paid to sell to investors. Kudos to those who make their best effort despite of the lack of support from firm management.</p><p> Firms that want to be in the retirement business will have to provide fiduciary support to well-meaning intermediaries; while those who deny fiduciary care will have to leave that part of the financial services industry. A handful will leave, and that is undoubtedly a good thing.</p><p> That is fair. </p><p> <strong>  Some will lead. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Schwab is leading the way with one of its biggest constituent (and revenue generating) groups, independent RIA firms. It's a great thing because there is enormous value in the fiduciary advice these firms provide, for a fee, to investors.  </strong></p><p> <strong>  Non-fiduciary firms may want to take note of Schwab's action. </strong>  And as non-fiduciary firms know: if they want to be in the retirement business they will have to make the transition to fiduciary status, and actually place clients' best interests before their own bottom line. They will need to change their culture, how they rank financial intermediaries (certainly it won't be in how much they sell anymore), and how they pay them -- as professionals, for genuine, fiduciary advisory service based on prudence, and investment fiduciary competence (not with conflicted commissions on products that are not in the investor's best interest).</p><p> <strong>  For non-fiduciary firms that make the transition to fiduciary status </strong> , the result will be a professionalization of the investment industry and support for the majority of intermediaries who want to put clients' best interests first. </p><p> No longer selling products for the embedded commissions, intermediaries will need -- and get -- investment training instead of sales training. Training -- not in how to sell, but in investment theory, diversifying clients' assets, financial planning and in the fiduciary process.  </p><p> Intermediaries' rankings won't be based on \"production\" anymore. It will be based on other metrics -- on client satisfaction and longevity with a firm, client goals met, outcomes and referrals.</p><p> Compensation, likewise, will be different -- based on professional fee sand metrics as in the legal, accounting and medicine professions. Hours spent working with clients, client needs fulfilled, financial plans completed, monitoring of portfolios and plans, and assets gathered will all play a role.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Duties of Loyalty and Due Care </strong></h3><p> <br/> To enable firms and intermediaries to make this transition to a true advisory profession, independent of product \"distributors,\" firms and intermediaries will need to exhibit both loyalty to clients and process for exercising due care of clients' financial wellbeing.  </p><h3> <strong>  Fiduciary Excellence </strong></h3><p> <br/> Excellence in fiduciary process means fiduciary firms use fiduciary best practices backed in regulatory statute and law to ensure that they always act in their clients' best interest, such as those outlined in \" <strong>  Prudent Processes for Investment Advisors </strong> ,\" from  <a href=\"https://www.fi360.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  fi360  </a> and the Centre for Fiduciary Excellence ( <a href=\"http://www.cefex.org/advisor/Index.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CEFEX) </a> . These processes are very good for clients  and  firms --  <strong>  RIA firms that have been certified to the Global Standard of Fiduciary Excellence  grow nearly twice as fast as non-certified RIA firms.  </strong></p><p> Fiduciary firms share a number of characteristics. They:</p><li> have written policies in place that guide decisions affecting clients and management of the firm, such as an RFP or other written process for selecting, and periodically monitoring vendors.</li><li> have an investment policy statement signed by each client -- the road map for client's long-term success based on the client's background, time horizon, risk tolerance, goals and needs.</li><li> have a written agreement signed by each client, clearly spelling out responsibilities, costs and fiduciary duty. </li><li> possess or acquire the competence, knowledge and diligence to prudently diversify and manage their client's portfolios.  </li><li> monitor clients' portfolios and have criteria in place to guide decision-making when an investment may need to be replaced.</li><li> avoid  conflicts of interest.</li><li> if a conflict is unavoidable, fiduciaries clearly disclose the conflict, ensuring that the investor understands it, and then  manage the conflict in the investor's best interest.</li><li> control the investor's all-in costs. This includes reasonable fees for advice or investment management and any fees paid to outside investment managers or other vendors. Fiduciary care extends to prudent selection of other fiduciaries or vendors needed by investor clients.</li><li> clearly disclose all material facts, in such a way that the investor can understand them. <br/>  </li><p> Products are already available and more are in development that have less compensation embedded in the product. A true advisory fee works the same way with investment fiduciaries as it does when one pays a professional -- doctor, lawyer or accountant and so on. The appropriate products will be recommended to to meet client's goals -- and this will make no difference in how the intermediary -- or firm -- is paid.</p><h3> <strong>  It costs less, not more, to run compliance at a fiduciary firm </strong></h3><p> <br/> True fiduciary advisors who act in the best interests of their clients pay much less for errors and omissions insurance. Their compliance costs are much lower than brokers and insurance agents costs.</p><p> <strong>  Why? </strong>  Because if the model is to act in clients's best interests, instead of sell them whatever that pays the maximum seller's compensation (with commensurate harm to the investor), clients achieve better outcomes and are less likely to have reason to bring action against firms and intermediaries. The fiduciary model generates fewer claims and costs less to insure. </p><p> Campaigns against the DOL Fiduciary Rule and other efforts to allow non-fiduciary firms to slither out of the responsibility to place the investor's best interests before their own and to keep the anti-investor status quo will fail. </p><p> As custodian to many fiduciary registered investment advisers' clients,  <strong>  the impact of Schwab's ads will be ... HUGE! </strong></p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 16:19:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 16:19:29.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_AbvkjU6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/schwab-ads-place-clients-and-fiduciaries-front-and-center/\", \"post_id\": \"11920\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 16:19:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 16:19:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"schwab-ads-place-clients-and-fiduciaries-front-and-center\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11919\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5807\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Schwab-Ads-Place-Clients-and-Fiduciaries-Front-And-Center.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1247\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466654400,"author_id":265,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5580,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Brexit is all About: Taxation (and Regulation) Without Representation","link":"what-brexit-is-all-about-taxation-and-regulation-without-representation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I want to continue the  <a href=\"/learn/global/as-brexit-vote-approaches-are-we-nearing-the-end-of-the-eu-experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brexit conversation </a>  from last week. With only three days left before U.K. voters head to the polls, expectations of which side might win are beginning to shift toward the &ldquo;Brexiteers,&rdquo; while betting markets are still putting money on the &ldquo;stay&rdquo; campaign. However, the probability of victory for those who favor keeping their European Union membership has weakened rather remarkably in the last month, falling from over 80 percent in mid-May to around 62 percent today, according to BCA Research. <img alt=\"\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Probability-of-stay-brxit-vote-outcome.png\" width=\"600\"/> One of the main grievances is the burden of EU regulations, which are decided by unelected officials in Brussels with little to no cost-benefit analysis. These rules, which regulate everything from the number of hours someone can work (48 hours) to vacuum cleaner power, ultimately stifle growth and innovation.Consider the so-called FANG stocks&mdash;Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. These four tech behemoths, not to mention Apple, rank among the most disruptive, transformative companies the world has ever seen. They also happen to be American. Nothing like them exists in Europe&mdash;or, for that matter, anywhere else across the globe.When&rsquo;s the last time a major scientific or technological breakthrough was made in France? In Germany? Where&rsquo;s Europe&rsquo;s answer to Silicon Valley?It&rsquo;s not that these countries lack capable thinkers and entrepreneurs. Far from it. Europe was once at the center of everything, from science to music to business. But now that Piketty-style &ldquo;envy economics&rdquo; reign supreme in the EU, innovation has increasingly shifted west toward the U.S.And it doesn&rsquo;t end there. EU officials continually try to make demands on how these companies conduct their business, whether that be regulating Amazon and Netflix&rsquo;s original streaming content or suing Facebook over privacy issues.These are among the questions and concerns Brexiteers and Eurosceptics are bringing to the fore. And no matter the referendum&rsquo;s outcome, they&rsquo;re not likely to go away any time soon. In fact, this could very well be the beginning and should serve as a wakeup call to EU policymakers. Just as American colonists protested taxation without representation over 240 years by dumping an entire shipment of English tea into Boston Harbor, many Brits today are staging their own taxpayers&rsquo; revolt by demanding control over their own economy, budgeting, immigration policies and more.##TRENDING##This is more broadly a debate over common law (the U.K.) and civil law (the Continent). Under common law, there&rsquo;s greater protection of wealth and intellectual property. You&rsquo;re presumed innocent until proven guilty. Why are real estate prices higher in London, New York City and Hong Kong than in Rome, Paris and Berlin? Common law.Also at issue is the EU&rsquo;s immigration and open borders policy, which has brought more than 600,000 asylum seekers into the U.K. in recent years.I invite you to watch  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMxfAkxfQ0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brexit: The Movie </a> , a Hollywood-caliber documentary that details many of the arguments in favor of the U.K. leaving the EU. When London financial markets were deregulated in the 1980s under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it led to what is known as the &ldquo;Big Bang,&rdquo; named for the skyrocketing growth in market activity, and the same could very well happen to the U.K.&rsquo;s economy post-Brexi.##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> The High Cost of Indirect Taxation</h3>The U.K.&rsquo;s EU club membership, so to speak, varies year-to-year, but it averages between 8 and 10 billion pounds&mdash;the equivalent of $11 billion and $14 billion&mdash;making the kingdom the third largest net contributor after Germany and France. But the costs don&rsquo;t stop there. Towering above the contribution to the EU&rsquo;s budget are costs associated with the bloc&rsquo;s endless regulations&mdash;what I refer to as indirect taxation.According to Open Europe, a nonpartisan European policy think tank, the top 100 most expensive EU regulations set the U.K. back an annual 33.3 billion pounds, equivalent to $49 billion. This amount exceeds what the U.K. Treasury collects in Council Tax (a tax on domestic property) on an annual basis.<img alt=\"\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/COMM33-3-billion-euros-annual-cost-of-the-EU-top-100-regulations-on-UK-businesses.png\" width=\"600\"/>And remember, that&rsquo;s just the top 100. The &ldquo;acquis communautaire,&rdquo; the EU&rsquo;s body of rules, directives and regulations, is a mammoth 170,000 pages long. Among the costliest regulations are the Renewable Energy Strategy (4.7 billion pounds a year), the Working Time Directive (4.2 billion a year) and the EU Climate and Energy Package (3.4 billion a year).Tim Congdon, a prominent British economist and businessman, shows that such regulations&mdash;again, passed by unelected officials, similar to agencies here in the U.S.&mdash;have been a significant detriment to EU growth. Writing for the pro-leave group Economists for Brexit, he states: &ldquo;It is obvious that the economies of EU member states are falling behind those of other high-income countries, falling behind consistently, and by a significant amount. Too much regulation must be the main explanation.&rdquo;<img alt=\"\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Euro-Area-Lags-Behind-Other-High-Income-Societies.png\" width=\"600\"/>Of course, these rules won&rsquo;t disappear overnight if the U.K. chooses to leave. But it would be a step in the right direction toward repatriating a level of autonomy over the country&rsquo;s own laws.In the meantime, investors are bracing for the referendum with gold, which has rallied 7 percent this month, breaking above $1,300 an ounce. The yellow metal has historically been favored as a &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; investment during times of political and economic uncertainty.And with interest rates at near-zero or negative levels, droves of European fixed-income investors are abandoning government debt for American municipal bonds. The German 10-year government bond yield fell to subzero levels last week for the first time ever, spurring additional European flight into munis, which still offer attractive yields, relatively low volatility and diversification benefits.<h3> Let&rsquo;s Not Forget to Clean House Here in the U.S.</h3>The EU is hardly the world&rsquo;s only offender when it comes to passing onerous regulations. The U.S. government continues to add to the already bloated Federal Registry, which now stands at 80,260 pages as of the end of 2015. That year, federal regulations cost U.S. businesses a staggering $1.885 trillion, or $15,000 per household, according to the Competitiveness Enterprise Institute (CEI). If U.S. regulations were its own economy, in fact, they would be the world&rsquo;s ninth largest, sandwiched in between India and Russia.<img alt=\"\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/us-regulation-costs-would-be-the-ninth-largest-economy-in-the-world.png\" width=\"600\"/>This is something our next president will have no choice but to address. 2015 was a record year for adding new regulations. We can&rsquo;t continue going down this path. The problem is that I haven&rsquo;t seen either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton make a serious commitment to streamlining rules and laws that affect businesses, especially small to medium-size businesses.According to a 2015 National Small Business Association (NSBA) survey, &ldquo;regulatory burdens&rdquo; was near the top of the list of challenges small business owners said threatened growth and the survival of their companies. I&rsquo;m convinced that the candidate with the strongest economic and deregulatory plan has the best chance at winning the election in November.<img alt=\"\" height=\"362\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Will-wall-street-rally-behind-donald-trump-for-president.png\" width=\"600\"/>For whatever it&rsquo;s worth, though, a poll in Institutional Investor found that large-scale investors appear to favor Clinton for president right now by a pretty wide margin. When asked if Wall Street will rally behind Trump, a whopping 84 percent said no.All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice.

Based upon my research, I have come up with three reasons:</p><p> Sometimes these phrases are said sarcastically, such as on this ecard that&rsquo;s part of the humorous &ldquo;rotten&rdquo; series:  <i>  No, you&rsquo;re right. Let&rsquo;s do it the dumbest way possible because it&rsquo;s easier for you.  </i></p><p> Or, the person says &ldquo;no&rdquo; as part of an  <u>  unspoken  </u> addition to a comment, such as <i>   &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t disagree with that. I agree.&rdquo; </i>  The other person is supposed to know what was left unsaid and fill in the blanks. And sometimes in casual conversation that will happen. But not always.</p><p> And sometimes people just say &ldquo;no&rdquo; as a matter of course. There are some people who have a tendency to respond negatively to any comment or request &ndash; at least at first. I admit that I did that when my son was young. Saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; immediately gave me a second to evaluate what he wanted, before I (sometimes) agreed to his request. I found myself making comments such as, &ldquo;No. [slight pause] You can sleep over at Max&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; When I realized how often I was saying things like that, I stopped saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; and replaced it with the phrase &ldquo;Let me think about it.&rdquo;</p><p> Other solutions to eliminating these types of contradictory phrases include:</p><li> <b>  Eliminate the &ldquo;no.&rdquo; </b>  Simply state your response. Instead of saying, <i>   &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;  </i> say,  <i>  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; </i>  It&rsquo;s a more positive comment.</li><li> <b>  Explain the unspoken </b> .  Instead of saying,  <i>  &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re fine,&rdquo;  </i> you would clarify, <i>  &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re inappropriately dressed. You&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; </i></li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 16:33:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 16:33:03.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_ymoZWJX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-agree-with-no-i-agree/\", \"post_id\": \"11928\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 16:33:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 16:33:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-agree-with-no-i-agree\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11929\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5809\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Do-You-Agree-With-No-I-Agree.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"572\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466611200,"author_id":51,"chart_url":""}

Are you afraid of the digital revolution? Are you afraid of the ongoing innovations in our financial planning business? Are you afraid you can&rsquo;t keep up? Are you afraid your client doesn&rsquo;t recognize the value you deliver? Are you afraid you will not have a reason to exist?</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no need to.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s face it.</p><p> The financial planning business is changing. Rapidly. There are so many new developments every day, it sometimes feels that we&rsquo;re sitting still while the whole world is moving. Not knowing what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p><p> And while the world is changing, you&rsquo;re doing the same stuff that worked yesterday, 5 years ago, maybe even 10 years ago.</p><p> You&rsquo;re doing &ldquo;the usual&rdquo;.</p><p> And sometimes it feels like most of the time you&rsquo;re stumbling around in the dark. Because you don&rsquo;t know if the work you are doing now, will also work tomorrow.</p><p> It feels like a never-ending guessing game.</p><p> And it gets even worse.</p><p> Because there are new players who DO seem to know. Here are some examples:</p><p> <strong>  Nutmeg.  </strong> In 10 minutes you can have an online portfolio. Professional, fast, cheap and flexible.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nutmeg.png\" width=\"915\"/></p><p> <strong>  Etoro.  </strong> A social investment network.

Or to flee in to safety in the face of things that scare him.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t diminish his need to feel important or to feel acknowledged. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s the right-brain emotional experience that &lsquo;moves&rsquo; your client.</p><p> Still, the question remains: &ldquo;What exactly  does  move people towards you and your financial planning service?&rdquo;</p><p> (and what  doesn&rsquo;t  move them in the direction of the online revolutionaries?)</p><p> Here are some answers:</p><p> It&rsquo;s  the feeling  of importance ,  it&rsquo;s  the feeling  of acknowledgement,   it&rsquo;s  the feeling  of peace of mind ,  it&rsquo;s  the feeling  of hope ,  it&rsquo;s  the feeling  of recognition ,  it&rsquo;s  the feeling  of trust , etc.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s any number of Facebook likes that can replace a hug&rdquo; ~ Seth Godin </strong></p><p> And I hear you think &hellip; feeling &hellip; ok &hellip;., but what should I do next? What&rsquo;s the secret sauce, the magic ingredient, the proverbial golden elixir that ignites that feeling?</p><p> (cue drumroll)</p><p> <strong>  Empathy. </strong></p><p> Disappointed?</p><p> Well, not if you read this:</p><h3> <strong>  The Most Disastrous Assumption Anyone Can Make about Financial Planning </strong></h3><p> <br/> Empathy isn&rsquo;t always held in high regard amongst financial planners. It&rsquo;s often considered a soft-hearted nicety in an industry that demands hard-headed detachment. Most of us believe we:</p><li> Need to think rationally and logically.</li><li> Need to strategize, not empathize.</li><li> Need to prize emotional distance and cool reason. <br/>  </li><p> And it&rsquo;s not our fault. We are trained to have the ability to step back, assess the situation, and give solid advice, unimpeded by emotion.</p><p> And because of this training, we fall victim to the most disastrous assumption anyone can make about financial planning. It&rsquo;s an assumption made by all left-brain-planners who want to matter to their clients by helping them with their knowledge.</p><p> <strong>  The fatal assumption is: if you understand the left-brain part of financial planning, you understand what matters most to your clients. </strong></p><p> The reason that this is fatal, is that it just isn&rsquo;t true. In fact, I believe it&rsquo;s the reason why some financial planners are struggling these days.</p><p> If you are still under the fatal assumption that you engage your clients just because of  your knowledge, experience or your financial plan,  you are just wrong.</p><p> Because if you understand the left-brain part of your financial planning service, you understand  <strong>  how the technical part of financial planning is done. </strong></p><p> (That&rsquo;s the part computers and software can do better than you)</p><h3> <strong>  What Developing Empathy Can Do for Your Financial Planning Service </strong></h3><p> <br/> Empathy isn&rsquo;t new in our profession.</p><p> It&rsquo;s as old as mankind. But because empathy deals with the right-brain-part of our profession where emotions and &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; are leading, it tends to be shoved into a corner and pulled out only when needed.</p><p> Just think about our financial planning education programs and how much of our CFP program contains the behavioural part of financial planning.</p><p> Need I say more?</p><p> It&rsquo;s almost as if they say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not important&rdquo;.</p><p> But here&rsquo;s the thing: empathy is an everyday-ritual. Because if you listen, you&rsquo;ll notice our daily language is filled with references to feeling what other people are feeling. References like:</p><li> <strong>  Walk a mile in another man&rsquo;s shoes. </strong></li><li> <strong>  See the world through my eyes. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Now you know what it feels like. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Welcome to my world. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Simply put:</p><p> <strong>  Empathy is the ability to ride in another person&rsquo;s skin. </strong></p><p> Which is something robots, computers and your digital competitors CAN NOT do.</p><p> Ever.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  What Empathy is NOT </strong></h3><p> <br/> Take three minutes and watch this video on the difference between empathy and sympathy by Bren&eacute; Brown, an American scholar, author and public speaker who is currently a research professor at the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work.</p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/1Evwgu369Jw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"637\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Brene%CC%81-Brown.png\" width=\"1200\"/></a><br/>click to view<br/> <p> It should be clear that empathy isn&rsquo;t sympathy. Empathy isn&rsquo;t about &ldquo;I&rdquo; or &ldquo;me&rdquo;.</p><p> You might think that when you talk vividly about financial planning, people automatically feel what you feel about your beautiful profession. That people actually care about financial planning.</p><p> That&rsquo;s YOU thinking.</p><p> But any other living creature?</p><p> I&rsquo;m sorry, they don&rsquo;t care. In fact,  they couldn&rsquo;t care less .</p><p> That&rsquo;s why, before you can even talk about financial planning, you need people&rsquo;s permission. You see, people are naturally cautious about opening their minds &ndash; the most precious thing they own &ndash;  to anyone in the financial services industry. You need to find a way to overcome that caution.</p><p> And the way you do that is to make visible the human being cowering inside you.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s your #1 advantage over any other digital competitor:</p><p> <strong>  Clicking a website is often a transfer of information. Meeting a financial planner face to face is often a transfer of emotion.1 </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s not just the words you say. Not at all.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the person delivering the words.</p><p> To make an impact, there has to be a human connection. You can give the most brilliant pitch, with crystal-clear financial explanations and laser-sharp logic, but if you don&rsquo;t first connect with your audience, it just won&rsquo;t land.</p><h3> <strong>  The Simplest Way to Empathize with Anyone about Financial Planning  </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not about how smart you are. It&rsquo;s not about the professionalism of your financial planning service. And it&rsquo;s not even about giving clients financial tips about earning more money or saving taxes.</p><p> Empathy is about the way you make your clients  feel .</p><p> This doesn&rsquo;t mean you want them to cry. Or to make them laugh out loud.</p><p> <strong>  The easiest way to empathize with your clients is to let them think about themselves. </strong></p><p> Why?</p><p> Because thinking about themselves makes them feel  alive .</p><p> You&rsquo;ve probably felt it, right? You&rsquo;ve had a conversation with a friend, about something important to you, and your friend asks: &ldquo;Why is that important to you?&rdquo;</p><p> It gets you to think about your WHY, your inner drive, your reason for doing things. And thinking about what&rsquo;s important to you makes you feel a little bit different. It makes you feel a little bit &lsquo;special&rsquo;. It makes you feel a little bit more awake.</p><p> Well, great financial planning does that too. It gets people to think about the most important thing in life:</p><p> Themselves.</p><p> Do you realize how incredibly precious that is?</p><p> Because it means you&rsquo;re not just here to inform. It means you&rsquo;re not just here to analyze. It means you&rsquo;re not just here to persuade.</p><p> It means that you&rsquo;re making an impact. Because those conversations with real people can  change somebody&rsquo;s life .</p><p> After creating a financial plan for one of my clients, he gave me one of the best ways to define the value of financial planning. This is what he said to me:</p><p> <strong>  I already knew how many assets I have, but now I know how much it&rsquo;s worth. </strong></p><p> The beauty?</p><p> I started the financial planning experience by asking him one simple question. I asked him:</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s important about your assets to you, besides return, risk and costs? </strong></p><p> And do you know what happened?</p><p> I got him to  think . I got him to think about something he never thought of before.</p><p> And honestly, I feel better about this type of conversation than any analytical solution I present. I set out to make my client think about their own future, and he did, maybe in the biggest way possible.</p><p> The point?</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  It&rsquo;s Time to Start Taking Empathy in Your Financial Planning Service Seriously </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you talk with people about their finances, don&rsquo;t give them just another tip. Don&rsquo;t tell them just another cute story.</p><p> Get them to think about themselves.</p><p> Ask questions they&rsquo;ve never been asked before. Ask questions that get them thinking, even at night.</p><p> The effect?</p><p> You&rsquo;ll bring them back to life. Maybe not forever, maybe not even for a day, but for an hour or two. Give them something to think about so that they feel ALIVE.</p><p> Do that, and they won&rsquo;t just move on to another website, an online wealth manager, an online financial planning service.</p><p> They&rsquo;ll go to YOU. They&rsquo;ll happily pay YOU for your service. They&rsquo;ll even share YOUR phone number with their friends.</p><p> And when they come to you, you&rsquo;ll show them what you&rsquo;re capable of by providing your financial planning service in a way no other online service can do. You&rsquo;ll ask real, meaningful questions again and again and again until they find their spark for good.</p><p> From then on, you&rsquo;ll be their hero. They&rsquo;ll think about YOU, when they think about money and finance. You&rsquo;ll be, quite literally, their friend in finances.</p><p> But the best part?</p><h3> <strong>  You&rsquo;ll Know You Made a Difference </strong></h3><p> <br/> I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I pass into the great beyond, I won&rsquo;t be thinking about the number of financial plans, the assets under management or the money I earned.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll be thinking about people I had great conversations with. People who said nice things about me. People I consider as friends.</p><p> Those are the things that matter. Those are the things we are working for. Those are the things we need to build our entire businesses around.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here. That&rsquo;s why we matter.</p><p> So get to work.</p><p> People are waiting for you.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s make financial planning matter</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 16:58:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 16:58:49.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_r562PpR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/this-rarely-used-tool-helps-every-advisor-outsmart-any-digital-competitor/\", \"post_id\": \"11936\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 16:58:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 16:58:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"this-rarely-used-tool-helps-every-advisor-outsmart-any-digital-competitor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11930\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5810\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/This-Rarely-Used-Tool-Helps-EVERY-Advisor-Outsmart-ANY-Digital-Competitor.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1105\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466593200,"author_id":409,"chart_url":""}

If someone, somewhere is doing something, chances are they&rsquo;ve been incentivized. <br/>  </h3><p> Nowhere is that more apparent than in the workforce. Whether it&rsquo;s salary, benefits or workplace perks, the companies who offer the best incentives tend to attract the best employees.</p><p> But beyond a nice paycheck and quality healthcare plan, what options do companies have to incentivize their employees? Read on for some of the most common and how you can leverage them in your financial life:</p><h3> Stock Options <br/>  </h3><p> Companies that offer stock options to their employees give them the right or privilege to purchase stock in the company. Employees are often only allowed to buy a certain number of shares, and usually have to wait until a certain time to act upon or exercise their options.</p><p> They&rsquo;re allowed to buy the stock options at a price set by the company. The benefit comes if the price set by the company is less than the current market price. For example, if an employee exercises his or her stock options by buying the stock at $10 a share when the market price is $20, they can sell their stock and earn a $10 profit.</p><p> Having stock options does not give you the stock &ndash; it only gives you the option to buy it. You still have to purchase it with your own money, or determine if your company provides the option of a cashless exercise.</p><h3> Employee Stock Purchase Plans <br/>  </h3><p> Another way to incentivize employees, stock purchase plans are when companies allow their staff to buy stock at a discount and through their regular paycheck. There is often a limit to how much stock an employee can buy &ndash; both by the employer and the IRS.</p><p> Employee stock purchase plans are like having a coupon for buying stock. Stocks can be bought at a discount of 10-15% from the market price.</p><h3> Bonuses <br/>  </h3><p> Employers often grant bonuses to incentivize employees, reward efficiency and share company revenue. Bonuses are rarely guaranteed and are often a sign of how well a company is doing.</p><p> Even if you&rsquo;re confident in your work, it&rsquo;s important not to rely on bonuses. They&rsquo;re never guaranteed, and it can be dangerous to count on money that you might not receive. If you do get a bonus, use it for something practical like paying down high-interest debt, saving for a down payment or contributing to a retirement account.</p><h3> 401(k) Matches <br/>  </h3><p> Many companies offer 401(k)s to their employees and some offer a matching program. Usually, this requires an employee to make a contribution to the 401(k) and the company will match part of that contribution.</p><p> Employer contributions vary wildly. Some put in 100% of what their employees contribute, others offer only a small portion. For example, if you sign up for a 401(k) that matches 50% of what you put in up to 10%, that means the employer will contribute 5% if you contribute 10% of your income. Even if you contribute more than 10%, they&rsquo;ll still only put in 5%.</p><p> The employee&rsquo;s contributions are always 100% vested, which means they have total access to the money they put in. However, some employers have vesting programs that require an employee to work for a certain number of years before they can have partial or total control of the employer&rsquo;s contributions.</p><p> For example, if you are offered a 401(k) with a five-year graduated vesting program, it means that every year you&rsquo;ll become an extra 20% vested. If you leave after two years, you&rsquo;ll only be able to take 40% of what your employer has contributed. This is one way that employers encourage their staff to stay longer. Bottom line: Always contribute enough to take advantage of the full company match.</p><h3> Restricted Stock Units <br/>  </h3><p> A restricted stock unit is a stock promised to an employee upon a certain vesting schedule. Restricted stock units come with a vesting schedule to encourage employees to contribute to the company&rsquo;s growth and ensure the success of its stock. Employees have to pay taxes on the stock units once they&rsquo;ve become 100% vested in them.</p><p> Like 401(k) employer matches, this vesting program encourages company loyalty and low turnover.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Employees may be able to buy the stocks, but they can also receive them as a gift for being an employee.</p><p> When looking into employment with a company or when evaluating the benefits offered at your current employer, don&rsquo;t forget to factor in these incentives as they can add great value to your financial life. I&rsquo;ve personally helped many clients analyze these benefits and leverage them to efficiently pay off debt, set aside for bigger goals such as home purchases, and maximize their retirement savings. Be sure to work with a professional to factor in issues such as taxes, capital gains and blackout dates for purchases and sales when determining how to utilize these incentives in your life.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 17:11:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 17:11:58.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_amrIuzv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-best-leveraging-your-employer-incentive-plans-like-401k-to-meet-your-money-goals/\", \"post_id\": \"11939\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 17:11:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 17:11:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-best-leveraging-your-employer-incentive-plans-like-401k-to-meet-your-money-goals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11938\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5812\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-You-Best-Leveraging-Your-Employer-Incentive-Plans-Like-401k-to-Meet-Your-Money-Goals.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"863\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466614800,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5585,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Adapting the Concept of Sunscreen to Understand FDIC and SIPC Insurance","link":"adapting-the-concept-of-sunscreen-to-understand-fdic-and-sipc-insurance","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Summer solstice means that it&rsquo;s time to re-stock the sunscreen. <br/>  </h3><p> There are a surprising number of factors to consider when choosing a blocker &ndash; smell, shimmer, thickness, packaging &ndash; but none are as important as Sun Protection Factor, or SPF. Despite popular belief, SPF count is not the number of hours or minutes you can be in the sun before you burn (there aren&rsquo;t 30 hours of daylight, after all).</p><p> SPF works like this: if you tend to burn after 30 minutes in the sun, SPF 15 will protect your skin for 15 times longer, or seven and a half hours. Now that you know how skin protection works, we&rsquo;d like to shed some sunlight on two other forms of protection for your cash and investments that are also often misunderstood: FDIC and SIPC insurance. </p><p> FDIC Insurance protects clients of member banks from losses that result from a bank failure, afforded by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a US Federal Agency. FDIC coverage applies to cash-like instruments held by banks like checking and savings account cash, CD&rsquo;s, and money market deposit accounts. It does not cover investments held at a bank, like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. The limit of insurance afforded per bank is $250,000 per account registration.</p><p> For example, if you have an IRA account and an Individual account, each account has $250,000 of protection. The major function of this insurance is to offer peace of mind to depositors in order to avoid the It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life &ldquo;run on the bank&rdquo; scenario- attempting to grab as much money as possible before the bank is tapped dry. Know that banks don&rsquo;t have 100% of deposits available for withdraw at a moment&rsquo;s notice and, in fact, they are only required to maintain a small percentage of total deposits on reserve, freeing up funds for lending to homeowners, business owners and credit card users. Because of this, prior to the FDIC, mere rumors of bank trouble could have an unwarranted and devastating effect on banks.  </p><p> SIPC Insurance is to brokerage firms what FDIC is to banks.  The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the SIPC) is a non-profit membership corporation created to provide a similar function as the FDIC but for securities (i.e., stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc.). It is important to understand that SIPC Insurance does not protect you from market movements or bad investments; it only protects you from losses incurred due to failure of the member brokerage firm.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The current limit on SIPC coverage afforded per brokerage firm is $500,000 per account registration, of which only $250,000 can be for cash. This means that if you have $500,000 in your account, $300,000 of cash and $200,000 of stock, $50,000 of your cash is uninsured. There are two important caveats, however.</p><p> First, most firms are now associated with a FDIC member bank and sweep cash to the bank arm, giving it FDIC-level protection, instead of the lower SIPC limit on cash.</p><p> Second, most major brokerage firms purchase supplemental policies to provide more protection, some with limits that exceed $100 million per customer. SIPC coverage allows customers to feel comfortable keeping their investments in a brokerage account instead of holding physical certificates in a safe deposit box. It has increased the liquidity of the capital markets greatly, allowing investments to be bought and sold electronically without the need to move physical pieces of paper around.  </p><p> Unlike sunscreen, these coverages are not seasonal and should be understood year-round. Not sure if you&rsquo;re covered? Confirm that your bank is a FDIC member and use this calculator to see if your coverage is adequate. Also, confirm that your brokerage firm is an SIPC member and go online to get details on their SIPC insurance supplement amount. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 17:21:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 17:21:06.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_KhtoqnN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/adapting-the-concept-of-sunscreen-to-understand-fdic-and-sipc-insurance/\", \"post_id\": \"11941\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 17:21:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 17:21:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"adapting-the-concept-of-sunscreen-to-understand-fdic-and-sipc-insurance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11940\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5813\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Adapting-the-Concept-of-Sunscreen-to-Understand-FDIC-and-SIPC-Insurance.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"704\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466622000,"author_id":479,"chart_url":""}

Chronic illness ranks high, but it&#39;s better managed with improved healthcare and access to services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing older and dealing with long-term care includes help from many people, family members, friends, medical professionals and practitioners in the community. Sometimes aging is gradual and sometimes it&#39;s abrupt with many bumps and emergencies. As people age, the majority develop at least one health problem resulting in functional decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s turn our attention to areas that address well-being. As an individual ages, the choices and resources for care become complex, and many times, more costly. As one moves through the stages, think about your needs and how to plan for long-term care. Dr. Mark Frankel is the creator of the stages of aging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stage 1 - Self-sufficiency</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first stage, you are self-reliant. You manage chronic health problems and disabilities on your own and have little need for help. You prefer independence. At this time, AARP recommends that you assess your place and the community where you live. Ask, &quot;Will my home and community support me through the major ups and downs?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaluate your health, the types of care and paying for them. Create and execute the relevant legal documents, and learn how to advocate for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stage 2 - Interdependence</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the second stage, you become reliant on others like an adult child, a partner, spouse, or a friend for assistance. And if you live alone, planning for care is even trickier. At this time, most older adults view interdependence as decline and one should start looking for independent living options offering security, meal plans, cleaning, and laundry services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stage 3 - Dependency</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As you become more dependent for help with daily living activities like bathing, cooking, and shopping, you may experience a gradual, progressive decline in physiological functioning. At this stage, you&#39;re coping with multiple chronic conditions and pain. The advanced need for care may require you to hire outside help for personal care assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stage 4 - Crisis management</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The requirement for personal care has outstripped the informal care given by family and friends, and professional care may be too costly. At this stage, the family stays in crisis management making it challenging and painful for everyone involved. Your physical health and mental conditions have declined to such a degree that you remain dependent on others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stage 5 - End of Life</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Frankel&#39;s end of life phase occurs when you have no other choice but to move to a nursing home. It&#39;s the time you need extensive personal help. At this period, family members and friends deal with the complex end-of-life decisions, which are painful. End of life care requires support from home health aides, nursing home personnel, hospice providers, and palliative care physicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each one of us will move through the phases differently, and maybe, you will skip one or two of them. So, use the stages as a framework for understanding your potential needs.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 17:26:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 17:26:57.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_t1UVFTb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/understanding-the-5-stages-of-aging-from-self-sufficiency-to-end-of-life/\", \"post_id\": \"11943\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 17:26:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 17:26:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"understanding-the-5-stages-of-aging-from-self-sufficiency-to-end-of-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11942\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5814\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Understanding-the-5-Stages-of-Aging-from-Self-Sufficiency-to-End-of-Life.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"3801\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":37617,"author_id":87,"chart_url":""}

Plus, because earwax lubricates, moisturizes, and protects the ear canal from infection, removing it can cause a lot of trouble. Who knew?)</p><p> Of course, Shrek isn&rsquo;t the only culprit when it comes to spreading myths. With respect to the life insurance secondary market &ndash; commonly known as life settlements &ndash; there are almost too many myths to count. Unfortunately, some of the misconceptions about the secondary market are purposefully perpetuated by life insurance companies that aggressively place their own profit margins ahead of their customers&rsquo; interests. But I&rsquo;m not here to point fingers (in ears, eyes, or wherever). Instead, let me bust three of the biggest myths about life settlements and the life insurance secondary market once and for all.</p><h3> <strong>  Myth #1: The Life Insurance Secondary Market Preys on Seniors </strong></h3><p> <br/> The image is of a grandpa who, years earlier, dutifully took out a life insurance policy for the protection of his wife and children. Now, as grandpa has gotten older, some slick life settlement company comes along and convinces grandpa to sell his policy for pennies on the dollar, leaving nothing for his family for when he passes away.</p><h3> Myth BUSTED: The life insurance secondary market actually helps seniors obtain maximum value for life insurance policies that are almost certain to lapse or be surrendered.</h3><p> <br/> When a senior terminates a policy, they receive little or nothing in the form of a cash surrender value. When a policy is sold, the senior receives a fair market value that far exceeds that cash surrender value. Also, seniors are increasingly choosing to sell only a portion of their life insurance &ndash; thus, eliminating future premiums &ndash; and retaining a portion for their beneficiaries.</p><p> There simply is no predatory aspect to the life insurance secondary market. It is a matter of fact that the vast majority of life insurance policies that are issued never result in a benefit paid to beneficiaries. An astounding 88% of universal life policies are either lapsed or surrendered prior to a claim, according to statistics cited by the <a href=\"http://www.lisa.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Life Insurance Settlement Association </a> .</p><p> The reasons policies terminate are many. It could be that grandpa&rsquo;s children are adults now, or his spouse has died, and thus there is no longer a need to protect his beneficiaries. It could be that grandpa has sufficient assets to support his family in retirement and beyond, eliminating the need for the policy. Plus, federal estate tax laws have changed in recent years, so if he took out the policy to pay &ldquo;death taxes,&rdquo; that need is gone.</p><p> Often, however, <strong>  <u>   seniors are forced out of their policies  </u> </strong> because premiums become too expensive to maintain in retirement. Last year, a number of insurance companies imposed rate increases on certain universal life insurance policies &ndash; some by as much as 100 percent or more &ndash; including increases <strong>  <u>   targeted directly at seniors  </u> </strong> , as featured in a series of Wall Street Journal Articles on the subject (see, Retiree&rsquo;s Stung by &lsquo;Universal Life&rsquo; Costs , WSJ, August 10, 2015; and Life Insurers Pass Pain of Low Rates on to Consumers , WSJ, March 20, 2016).</p><p> This is precisely when selling, rather than surrendering, a policy is the best option for seniors and their families who face the real likelihood of losing their policies altogether for little or nothing.</p><p> Life settlements pay seniors an average of 4 to 11 times what they would have received from the insurer for a surrendered policy, according to studies conducted by the US Government Accountability Office (2010) and the London Business School (2013).</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> At GWG, we&rsquo;ve paid seniors nearly $336 million to purchase their policies over the past 10 years. Had those seniors surrendered their policies back to their insurance company, they would have received just $23 million. That&rsquo;s a difference of $313 million&mdash; or more than 10 times more than the insurance company would have paid.</p><p> In addition, GWG and other secondary market companies offer seniors the ability to sell only a portion of the policy&rsquo;s death benefit, retaining as much as 75 percent for their loved ones. Retained benefit life settlements are a sound way for seniors to be relived of the burden of paying increasingly costly premiums while still providing protection for their families.</p><p> So, instead of receiving little or nothing for a policy that is being terminated, seniors receive substantially more if they sell their policies.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Myth #2: Secondary Life Insurance is an Unregulated &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo; Market </strong></h3><p> <br/> This myth paints a picture of shady players, risky transactions, and swindled seniors. No way an advisor would recommend such an unsavory transaction for their clients, goes the myth.</p><h3> Myth BUSTED: Life settlements are one of the most secure senior financial services available today!</h3><p> <br/> Back in the mid-to late 1990&rsquo;s, the life insurance secondary market (the old, &ldquo;viatical&rdquo; market) was new and, as expected, was not particularly regulated. Only a few states had any laws to regulate the transaction. That was then.</p><p> Today, 42 states covering over 90 percent of the US population have modern life settlement laws &ndash; most of which were either adopted or amended after 2007.</p><p> Now, when a senior sells their life insurance policy, they are protected by stringent consumer protections, including numerous consumer disclosures, disclosure of all offers, broker commissions, and alternatives to selling a policy. All sellers are dealing with licensed buyers (known as life settlement providers) and brokers and are presented with forms that have been approved for use by state insurance regulators. Furthermore, life settlement companies are required to adhere to Federal and state privacy laws that protect the personal, medical, and financial information of the policy owners.</p><p> And, how about this for extraordinary consumer protection: most states have a provision that requires a seller&rsquo;s own attending physician to certify their patient is competent and capable of understanding and entering into a contract to sell their own policy. In addition, GWG and other buyers require that the named beneficiaries of the life insurance policy consent to the sale. That is some serious consumer protection!</p><p> As a result of comprehensive regulation and industry practices, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has reported that since the start of 2013 only four (YES &ndash; FOUR!) consumer complaints have been reported to insurance regulators nation-wide. Interestingly, every one of those complaints was filed against an insurance company that may have been trying to interfere with the senior&rsquo;s sale of the policy.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s market is safe and sound for seniors to seek the maximum value for their unwanted and unaffordable life insurance policies.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Myth #3: For Financial Advisors, Life Settlements Aren&rsquo;t on the Menu </strong></h3><p> <br/> Even for advisors who are aware of the value of a life settlement for their clients, many are under the impression that their broker-dealer or insurance companies won&rsquo;t permit them to participate in the secondary market. Other advisors simply stick by the adage that they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do insurance.&rdquo;</p><h3> Myth BUSTED: A financial advisor&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to serve in the best interest of their clients. Advisors have both a duty of competence and duty of care in the service of their clients. And, just as a CPA is held accountable for knowing the most recent tax laws, financial advisors are held accountable for knowing the most recent financial services options available. It is a value added service to clients when you can help them unlock the secondary market value for their life insurance policies.</h3><p> <br/> Selling a policy relieves the pressures many seniors face with increased premiums, helps seniors reinvest in their retirement, and helps fund their health care and long-term care needs. Wouldn&rsquo;t you advise your own grandpa to sell his policy if he could get 10 times more for it? Wouldn&rsquo;t you want him to know that he can sell all of it or keep a portion of the policy without future premiums, rather than just mail it back to the insurance company? If you would give this advice to your grandpa, why wouldn&rsquo;t you give that same advice to your clients?</p><p> Importantly, life settlements are a terrific way to grow your practice. GWG has partnered with a growing number of broker-dealers and financial advisors who understand that a life settlement is beneficial to seniors, as well as to their practice. These broker-dealers and advisors have done their diligence on the secondary market and on GWG and have authorized their advisors to work with GWG to introduce life settlements to seniors. Some advisors are holding local events to introduce the secondary market to new potential clients, as well as to other financial services professionals.</p><p> If a Broker-Dealer or insurance company tries to steer you away from life settlements, it is in <strong>  <u>   your best interest  </u> </strong> to press the discussion further. Find out the specific objections and address them head on. It is likely they are basing their position on misconceptions or myths. The truth is the secondary market provides substantial value to seniors, is well-regulated, and provides a unique way to reconnect with old clients, recruit new clients, and grow your practice.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to get grossed out to bust the myths about the life insurance secondary market. Instead, you will discover that it&rsquo;s a valuable option for your clients &ndash; and your practice.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-21 22:42:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-21 22:42:41.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_uFgWPzA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/myth-busters-top-3-reasons-to-recommend-life-settlements/\", \"post_id\": \"11945\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-21 22:42:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-21 22:42:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"myth-busters-top-3-reasons-to-recommend-life-settlements\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11944\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5815\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Myth-Busters-Top-3-Reasons-to-Recommend-Life-Settlements_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1379\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466623800,"author_id":190,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5588,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Steps to Take to Create and Organize Advanced Client Segmentation","link":"8-steps-to-take-to-create-and-organize-advanced-client-segmentation","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Most coaching and consulting companies will tell you that one of the first things you need to do is look at who your clients are from an AUM/GDC perspective. <br/>  </h3><p> Once this is done, then you need to segment them: platinum, diamond, gold, A, A plus, B, C, D, or whatever they have trademarked to call them. Working with as many advisers as we have at Top Advisor, this method of segmentation is not complete, though it is a good place to start.</p><p> Basing a communication strategy and marketing events only off numbers is a terrible way to increase engagement, referrals, and overall client satisfaction. I want you to add some other categories so you can pinpoint who you should replicate, instead of who you want to replicate to just make more money. We all love money, don't get me wrong, but if you can make money and work with people you actually enjoy working with, then you win doubly.</p><h3> Here are eight steps to take to organize, segment, and create a complete list of what you need to know about your clients: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Start with what everyone else tells you to do <br/>  </h3><p> This means segmenting by name, GDC (or commissions if you work that way), outside assets, age, and other more general things.</p><h3> 2. Profitability <br/>  </h3><p> Are you making a reasonable profit? It surprises me how many advisers do not do this regularly. How often are you meeting? How long did those meetings last? We need to look at not only what time you spend with the client, but also but how much time does your team spend on these clients. You might have some clients who you think you're making an enormous amount of money from in a GDC or a commission perspective, but you're spending so much time with them that based on your hourly rate, which you should all be able to calculate very quickly, you're actually losing money. When you start evaluating clients this way, you start running a business, not just a firm.</p><h3> 3. Likability <br/>  </h3><p> Do you like seeing these people? This can simply be yes or no field in your CRM, or a yes or no category on an Excel Spreadsheet. We want you working with, and replicating, the clients you like! We will see if you can fire the ones you just cannot stand working with. Hopefully there aren't too many in your book you just can't stand to see.</p><h3> 4. Do they take your advice? <br/>  </h3><p> Like step three, this can be a quick yes or no categorization.</p><h3> 5. Do they refer, and if so, how many people have they referred? <br/>  </h3><p> Another very simple question to be able to put on an Excel spreadsheet or in a CRM. Yes, and they've referred five people to me, etc.</p><h3> 6. What do you have in common with them? <br/>  </h3><p> You need to create categories of commonality based on shared interests like golf, skiing, surfing, wine, or food. Can you answer what you have in common with your clients? If not, you will need to do some work, ask some questions, and be patient, as this process takes time. This will also help you focus on potential client-centered marketing events you could hold, which could get these people to show up and help you learn more about them.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 7. Have they been attending your events? <br/>  </h3><p> If these are people who consistently don't attend your events, then you need to sit down and ask them why.</p><h3> 8. Potential <br/>  </h3><p> One of the things that amazes me is that so many financial services professionals leave so much money on the table because they're not a full-service shop. I'm all about specialty, and if you don't want to dabble in other areas, that's entirely fine. But you need to have strategic relationships with people who do dabble. You need to look at long-term care, disability, life insurance, annuity products and alternative investments. Do they have money held outside by somebody else? If they do, why? Why isn't that money with you? That potential is another great way to focus your marketing efforts and ensure client segmentation isn't an exercise in futility, but is instead an exercise in profitability.</p><p> You can look very deeply into your book and find out a lot about what is working and what isn't. You can find out who is profitable and who is not. Taking the time to turn a critical eye to your clients can help you market to those that see the value in what you do, not just the ones who pay you the most.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-22 15:28:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-22 15:28:20.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_ALZsqma.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-steps-to-take-to-create-and-organize-advanced-client-segmentation/\", \"post_id\": \"11947\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-22 15:28:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-22 15:28:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-steps-to-take-to-create-and-organize-advanced-client-segmentation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11946\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5817\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/8-Steps-to-Take-to-Create-and-Organize-Advanced-Client-Segmentation.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"546\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466672400,"author_id":334,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5589,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Does Your Work Culture Follow These 19 Golden Rules of Success?","link":"does-your-work-culture-follow-these-19-golden-rules-of-success","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There&rsquo;s a lot of talk surrounding organizational culture &mdash; what makes it good, what makes it bad. More often than not, organizations just leave their culture up to chance. But that&rsquo;s definitely not the way to go about it if your desire is to create an engaged workforce and a thriving business.</p><p> Culture matters. Just check out these findings from Jobvite and Workforce 2020:</p><li> 21% of job seekers consider a company&rsquo;s culture when deciding to accept a job offer </li><li> 18% of employees reported that culture is a benefit that would increase engagement and loyalty </li><p> Culture has the power to influence recruitment and retention. And it makes sense. A poor culture drags down employee sentiment and productivity. Our Employee Engagement Report discovered that organizational culture is one of the top factors correlated to employee happiness. </p><p> The importance of creating a strong and thriving culture should be at the top of the list for organizations. And if you&rsquo;re unsure of where to start, here are some golden rules you need to follow:</p><h3> 1. Create a mission <br/>  </h3><p> Every company needs a direction. Your mission statement highlights the company&rsquo;s goals and what it&rsquo;s striving to achieve. So to create and maintain a strong culture, it has to be molded from the top down. Creating a mission statement will keep employees all on the same page and driving in the same direction.</p><h3> 2. Stick with your mission <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re going to create goals, stick with them. Even if you hit a bump in the road (financial losses, turnover, etc.), it doesn&rsquo;t give you permission to stray from the organization&rsquo;s mission. Remember, your mission is your company&rsquo;s GPS system &mdash; it tells everyone else where they need to go and why.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 3. Live your values <br/>  </h3><p> According to our research, less than half of employees know their organization&rsquo;s vision, mission, and cultural values. Plaster your values all over the walls, highlight employees who embrace them, and make your business decisions based off of them. If you, the manager, aren&rsquo;t living your organization&rsquo;s values, then your employees won&rsquo;t either.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/visionmissionvalues.png\" width=\"500\"/></p><h3> 4. Maintain transparency <br/>  </h3><p> What are the benefits of hiding information from employees? It might seem less complicated to wait until you have confirmation or you&rsquo;ve made a final decision, but doing that creates an air of assumptions. Be transparent with your information and keep employees in the loop so they know what&rsquo;s going on in the business.</p><h3> 5. Be open to feedback</h3><p> Employees are the ones in the trenches, so they should be empowered to offer up suggestions to improve their work environment. When you keep them happy, you&rsquo;ll enjoy a much more productive, engaged, and loyal workforce.</p><h3> 6. Be adaptable <br/>  </h3><p> As part of keeping employees happy and listening to their feedback, you&rsquo;ll also have to be open to change. If something&rsquo;s not working in the culture, get your employees involved with finding a solution to the issue. This will also help eliminate the us-versus-them mentality between leaders and employees.</p><h3> 7. Recognize often <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t wait until the annual review to high-five an employee. Do it right on the spot. When an employee goes for a long period of time without any recognition, they start feeling unappreciated and unvalued. And when that happens, you end up with unmotivated and less productive employees.</p><h3> 8. Have some fun <br/>  </h3><p> A survey by PGi states that 88% of millennials are actively looking for a fun work environment. So give your employees a break from their tasks by having some fun. Whether it&rsquo;s just a weekly team walk or a potluck, there&rsquo;s nothing better than showing your employees that work can be an enjoyable place to be.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/millennials_fun.png\" width=\"500\"/></p><h3> 9. Balance routines with spontaneity <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re going to have a recurring fun event, don&rsquo;t forget to throw in some spontaneous celebrations. Did someone close a big deal? Pop a bottle of champagne. Maybe your team has finally completed an important project. Take them out for dinner. Having only routines can get redundant, so shake things up once in a while to add some flavor.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 10. &ldquo;Culture&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t equal &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Many organizations think that having a strong culture means being crazy. But don&rsquo;t mix up those two. Yes, some cultures are more outlandish than others, but create one that suits your workforce and the brand. Throwing around a beach ball or having Friday afternoon happy hours may or may not work for team morale at your organization.</p><h3> 11. Hire for fit <br/>  </h3><p> When it comes to creating a community, hire people that are already embodying your culture in their everyday life. Use your organizational values as a basis for interview questions as a means to measuring how well they&rsquo;ll mesh organically into your culture. A business won&rsquo;t be able to succeed if you constantly have employees butting heads.</p><h3> 12. Encourage casual collisions <br/>  </h3><p> Create spaces where employees can spontaneously interact with one another. Think longer hallways, open seating areas, or break rooms. Doing this will encourage and foster a culture of collaboration, which can result in some great innovative ideas.</p><h3> 13. Create flexible spaces <br/>  </h3><p> Mix private work areas with open spaces. Sometimes people need a quiet area to focus on a specific task. And sometimes others thrive on the energy of constant chatter. Give your employees the option to pick workstations that suit whatever task they&rsquo;re tackling.</p><h3> 14. Offer growth opportunities <br/>  </h3><p> Employees don&rsquo;t want to be boxed in for life. They want to be at an organization that will nurture their professional growth, so offer opportunities for them to expand their skill sets. Whether it&rsquo;s offering extra training, moving them into another position, or letting them work on different projects, you&rsquo;ll be able to keep them sticking around much longer. How much longer? Organizations that offer professional development have a 10% higher employee retention rate, according to our research. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/professional_development.png\" width=\"500\"/></p><h3> 15. Measure your culture <br/>  </h3><p> Just like you&rsquo;d measure finance and productivity, you need to measure and assess your culture. Are employees happy? Do they feel engaged, or are there factors that are keeping them from completing their work? Use a simple tool like a pulsing survey to source this information and keep tabs on how your culture is holding up.</p><h3> 16. Be unique <br/>  </h3><p> Zappos has their own culture. So does Google. And so does your own company. Don&rsquo;t try to replicate other organizations. You can adopt certain aspects, but when you try to become a clone, your culture becomes inauthentic.

It is one of your available opportunities to tell the search engines what your web page is about, so it should contain your keyword(s) for that page.</p><p> The URL is made up of several components, primarily the Protocol, the Root Domain, and the sub-directory or path.</p><p> i.e. http://www.AdvisorWebMarketing.com/subdirectory/</p><h3> One Domain to Rule Them All <br/>  </h3><p> Whenever possible, use a single root domain for all of your web properties &ndash; don&rsquo;t have a separate URL for your blog. or separate micro-sites for each of your services or areas.</p><p> Splitting your web properties up results in multiple sites needing to be optimized individually &ndash; each will require fresh content and authority signals (i.e. backlinks), resulting in either more work or diminished results, or both.</p><p> Creating multiple sites used to be a common SEO strategy (and still is with some of my competitors) &ndash; the multiple sites allows you to create backlinks from one site to another &ndash; essentially creating a link farm. While this can still produce positive results in the short-term, Google has become very proficient at identifying these methods and will eventually penalize offending practitioners.</p><h3> Protocol <br/>  </h3><p> Almost 2 years ago, Google announced that having a secure site &ndash; adding an SSL certificate to your site, resulting in an https protocol rather than http &ndash; will result in a slight rankings benefit.</p><p> While not universally adapted yet (including on this site &ndash; yet), it is certainly a change to consider making. Learn more from  <a href=\"https://www.stonetemple.com/http-to-https.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Complete Guide to SSL and SEO </a> .</p><h3> Sub-directory, or Path <br/>  </h3><p> In order to be optimized for search, sub-directories should contain your keywords, be not be longer than 3-5 words, and should be separated by a hyphen.</p><p> i.e. http://www.AdvisorWebMarketing.com/how-to-write-an-seo-friendly-url/</p><p> While extending the length of your URL beyond 3-5 words (50-60 characters) will not impact your search rankings, it will make for a less user-friendly URL, and may negatively impact the click-through-rate from the Google Search Results Page.</p><p> The same is true for a hyphen. Search engines can read underscores, or even fill in blank spaces (using %20) but hyphens make the URL easier to read for potential visitors.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> WordPress URL SEO <br/>  </h3><p> For search purposes, set your WordPress blog so that your default URL subdirectory is the title of your post</p><p> i.e. http://www.AdvisorWebMarketing.com/how-to-write-an-seo-friendly-url</p><p> Note: If you have an existing blog, changing these settings will change the URL&rsquo;s from your already published posts! I would recommend instead, just customizing each as you post them (see below). However, if you are setting up a new WordPress blog . . .</p><p> If your current default settings result in a URL that looks like one of these . . .</p><li> http://blog.AdvisorWebMarketing.com/?p=123</li><li> http://blog.AdvisorWebMarketing.com/2013/24/02/how-to-write-an-seo-friendly-url/</li><li> http://blog.AdvisorWebMarketing.com/2013/02/how-to-write-an-seo-friendly-url/</li><li> http://blog.AdvisorWebMarketing.com/archives/123</li><p> . . . go to your WordPress dashboard and click on SETTINGS &gt;&gt;&gt; PERMALINKS &gt;&gt;&gt; and the POST NAME radio button, your posts will now display the blog title in the URL.</p><p> Although it doesn&rsquo;t affect your SEO, I would recommend not including the date of your post in your URL &ndash; it ages it in the eye of your reader, making them less likely to read, as you get further away from the publishing date.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Manually Creating Your URL in WordPress <br/>  </h3><p> If you want to manually customize the default URL &ndash; it may be too long &ndash;  or only make changes to future URLs (without changing your WordPress Settings), you can click on the URL &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; button . . .</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-To-Write-SEO-Friendly-URL.png\" width=\"564\"/></p><p> . . . and customize your URL. In this example, I could change it as follows:</p><p> http://AdvisorWebMarketing.com/write-an-seo-friendly-url</p><p> or I can remove &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; words (and, or, but, of, the, a, etc.)</p><p> http://AdvisorWebMarketing.com/how-write-seo-friendly-url</p><p> The URL is a simple, but important element of &ldquo;on-page&rdquo; SEO.

It is a complex process riddled with suppliers who innocently over promise and under deliver.</p><p> In fact, most of our clients come to us because they&rsquo;ve been under-served elsewhere and there is a heightened level of caution before proceeding. Selecting your financial marketing partners is a decision with a magnitude that should be right up there with buying a house.</p><p> In our world of silver bullets and quick fixes, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught in headlights of empty promises. There are plenty of self-proclaimed &ldquo;experts&rdquo; in almost all areas of marketing, and they are all clamoring for a piece of your advisor marketing budget.</p><p> The good news is that there are pragmatic steps you can take to move along and make the right decisions. What follows are some selection tips to help you figure out what questions to ask to help you make your decision.</p><h3> Types of Marketing &ldquo;Expertise&rdquo;: <br/>  </h3><li> Advisor Branding</li><li> Advisor Website Design &amp; Development</li><li> Seminar Marketing</li><li> Direct Mail Marketers</li><li> Telemarketers</li><li> Email Marketers</li><li> On-Demand Seminar Marketing</li><li> Multi-Media Marketing Kits</li><li> Sales Force Management</li><li> Social Media Coaches &amp; Marketing</li><li> Search Engine Optimization</li><li> Online Advertising and Lead Generation</li><li> Public Relations</li><li> Referral Generation Coaches &amp; Programs</li><li> Client Appreciation Event Marketing</li><h3> 9 Tips When Considering a Marketing Partner: <br/>  </h3><p> In order of importance, here are 9 selection tips to consider when researching and selecting a marketing partner to help grow your financial firm.</p><h3> 1. Hire for culture <br/>  </h3><p> The best partners to work with are built with people who enjoy their work, and working together. Equally important is a culture of not just about doing the right things, but doing the right things and achieving results. There are a lot of firms who have the ability to create great designs, but it&rsquo;s more important to find partners who focus on results first. The best cultures are the ones where the people aren&rsquo;t afraid of constructive debating and hard work to get the best results.</p><h3> 2. Hire for talent <br/>  </h3><p> After finding a marketing partner that fits with your culture, raw talent trumps almost everything else. Talent comes in a lot of forms. Consider creative, tactical, technical, and analytical talents in your search.</p><h3> 3. Hire for industry experience <br/>  </h3><p> Plain and simple, hiring a firm who understands the financial industry will save you time and headaches. Also make sure their marketing isn&rsquo;t too conservative and that they haven&rsquo;t been jaded by the inherent compliance-based limitations. Adhering to compliance restrictions is a must. Equally important is knowing how to collaboratively push the envelope.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Hire for breadth <br/>  </h3><p> Marketing firms with diverse talent have a more coordinated approach with more big-picture understanding and cooperation. Breadth yields a more complete solution and a focus on what the client needs versus having to recommend a narrower set of services.</p><h3> 5. Hire for integration <br/>  </h3><p> A coordinated approach is a pre-requisite for marketing success so make sure your marketing partners understand how differing tactics can work together for the best outcome.</p><h3> 6. Expand your talent pool <br/>  </h3><p> If you only search for local firms, you&rsquo;re potentially missing out on a much larger talent pool. Given today&rsquo;s desktop sharing and video conferencing capabilities, the old saying about location-location-location just doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore in most business to business relationships. As long as there are no language barriers, and as long as your marketing partners understand your local environment, your style, and your client base, you should be able to expand your search nationally or internationally to source the best people to get the job done.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 7. Don&rsquo;t choose by price alone <br/>  </h3><p> Shortcuts in marketing most often need complete re-dos when they fail. It&rsquo;s not like you can salvage a poorly designed website or a lackluster email campaign. There&rsquo;s wisdom in the saying, &ldquo;do it right the first time.&rdquo; Ensure pricing is only one criteria in your decision matrix. We&rsquo;ve all experienced situations where a seemingly low price wound up costing us more in the end because of the product quality.</p><h3> 8. Know who in your financial firm are the ultimate decision makers <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s important to know who is/are making the decisions. Everyone else should be contributing his or her insights to help them reach the best decision.</p><h3> 9. Hire for the future <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t hire a marketing partner based on what it did 5 years ago. Hire based on the company&rsquo;s understanding of marketing today and its philosophies and vision into the future.</p><p> These 9 tips will help you secure the best financial marketing available to you. All the best in your search.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-22 15:59:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-22 15:59:14.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_OsYh83I.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/your-search-for-the-best-financial-marketing-team-begins-here/\", \"post_id\": \"11957\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-22 15:59:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-22 15:59:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"your-search-for-the-best-financial-marketing-team-begins-here\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11956\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5820\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Your-Search-for-the-Best-Financial-Marketing-Team-Begins-Here.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"642\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466676000,"author_id":284,"chart_url":""}

Ginger throws out dozens of ideas &ndash; all of which are turned down:</p><p> &ldquo;We could&hellip;.!!!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Nah&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;We could&hellip;!!!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll never work.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;We could&hellip;.!!!&rdquo;</p><p> Lots-of-head-shaking.</p><p> Sound like a meeting or two you&rsquo;ve attended?</p><p> Finally, exhausted and frustrated, Ginger looks out over the crowd of chickens &ndash; all who are facing their demise, but none who seem to have the impetus to do anything about it, and says (in a wonderful British dialect), &ldquo;The fences aren&rsquo;t just around the farm, they&rsquo;re in your HEADS.&rdquo;</p><p> And I thought&hellip; yes.  Yes they are.  For most of us, our fences are in our heads.</p><h3> For most of us, our fences &ndash; the barriers that hold us back from being who and where we want to be &ndash; are in our heads.</h3><p> <br/> I see that with myself.  In all my reasons &ldquo;Why not&hellip;&rdquo;  In my need to be perfect before taking a leap.  All the barriers I erect in my mind to keep me safe.  Except they don&rsquo;t.</p><p> And I see them in all my participants, in my colleagues, friends, and family &ndash; because of course it&rsquo;s so much easier to see them in others than it is to look in the mirror.</p><p> I often say, when I lead a session, that if we can  name  it, we can do something about it.  What are your fences?</p><h3> If you can name it, you can do something about it. What are your fences?</h3><p> <br/> (Spoiler Alert!)  You will be happy to know that the chickens did eventually find the strength, creativity, focus, and fortitude to make it over the fence.  Yes, that was partly due to Ginger&rsquo;s incredible leadership and her talent for bridging the confidence of every chicken on the farm.  But she couldn&rsquo;t do it alone.  Each chicken had to find her own way to grapple with the fences &ndash; both real and imaginary.</p><p> For on the other side we might not only find the freedom we seek, we might just find our  <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/blog/project/speak/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  brave </a> .</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-22 16:10:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-22 16:10:53.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_1wmh0JQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-your-fences-a-barrier-to-being-brave/\", \"post_id\": \"11967\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-22 16:10:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-22 16:10:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-your-fences-a-barrier-to-being-brave\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11966\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5822\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-Your-Fences-a-Barrier-to-Being-Brave.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"625\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466694000,"author_id":281,"chart_url":""}

As a leader, stop expecting people to be good at everything. For example, few people walk the earth who are great at being both detail/task-oriented and engaging with people.

You&rsquo;ll also look smarter and increase your influence by being able to see your teammates as valuable assets, even if they think and act differently, than your way of operating.</p><h3> 3.

Therefore, we find it timely to discuss the client&rsquo;s historical need of a financial adviser. While the understanding of clients&rsquo; risk tolerances that robo-only advisors provide is undoubtedly an important part of investing, it remains only part of the picture. Of equal importance is taking into account the risk tolerance of investment markets and how this may impact the client&rsquo;s financial profile. Regardless of how much risk a person can afford to take, no one wants to enter an unstable market environment only to discover that he or she did not adequately account for his or her entire financial situation.</p><h3> The Singularity of the Individual</h3><p> <br/> Robo-only advisors can judge a client&rsquo;s risk tolerance very accurately if the client understands his or her goals, priorities, and situation very well. But how often is this truly the case? Clients often require more complex guidance as they crystallize their aims. A robo-only advisor is incapable of providing this type of guidance. It is not a stretch to believe that the narrow range of environments in which robo-only advisors excel will be a mitigating factor of their success.</p><p> It is understood that robo-only advisers are built by very intelligent people, but it appears that these engineers have forgotten the informal definition of an engineer: Someone who performs precision guesswork based on unreliable data provided by those of questionable knowledge. In their present structure, robo-only advisors are not equipped to blend the client&rsquo;s risk with market risk, both of which are dynamic. Because of this, there is ample reason to think they will have issues maintaining the trust of their user base.</p><p> Drawing on my past experience investing in the technology sector, I realized that the objective of technology is to spare people from performing mundane, repetitive tasks. Most innovation drives an increase in productivity by mechanizing repetitive functions that people do by hand. Think about TV dinners: Hot meals are time-consuming and costly to make, but because of the development of microwavable dinners, you simply have to unpackage a meal and pop it in the microwave to have a hot dinner ready. Viola!</p><p> However, this type of standardization only works when cooking and eating are viewed as tasks or chores. Tastes change, and most people don't want to eat the same thing over and over again (Unless it&rsquo;s pizza &mdash; everyone loves pizza). People seem to crave &ldquo;homecooked&rdquo; meals, despite the ready availability of microwavable meals. When it comes to food, most of us crave quality and variation. TV dinners fail to account for some people&rsquo;s desire for customization and craftsmanship.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Technology has proven highly effective at mechanizing the repetitive functions that hinder our day-to-day lives. It fails, however, at dealing with the exceptions to the rule. Human input, thought, and effort are required to handle tasks that are fluid, unpredictable, and complicated. Unlike people, robo-only advisors cannot easily adapt to new situations, hindering them in any environment that is not static and controlled.</p><p> Investing is built on singularities. Every individual has his or her own risk tolerance, return objectives, tax consequences, and family situation that need to be matched to the risks within the markets. The robo-only advisors&rsquo; strategy of forcing every investor into predefined buckets no matter the market environment may function when working with millennials, who are in the early years of saving and have adequate time to recover, but it trivializes the priorities and the circumstances that make us all unique.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-22 16:36:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-22 16:36:15.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_dLOS6eV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-robo-advisors-will-have-issues-maintaining-the-trust-of-their-user-base/\", \"post_id\": \"11976\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-22 16:36:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-22 16:36:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-robo-advisors-will-have-issues-maintaining-the-trust-of-their-user-base\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11975\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5825\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-Robo-Advisors-Will-Have-Issues-Maintaining-the-Trust-of-Their-User-Base.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"849\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466668800,"author_id":247,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5597,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Top Sales Producers: How They View and React to Objections Differently","link":"top-sales-producers-how-they-view-and-react-to-objections-differently","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Most sales reps hate getting objections. When they get them, their hands start to sweat, their heart takes the elevator down into the pit of the stomachs, and they start wishing they had gotten that graduate degree and avoided sales altogether.</p><p> This is how most sales reps react when they get objections, but not the top producers. Top producers view and react to objections very differently. To start with, because top producers thoroughly qualify their prospects up front they generally uncover and deal with many objections during the qualifying stage. Objections like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to show this to my partner,&rdquo; and others are already known and dealt with.</p><p> In addition, top producers have taken the time, long in advance, of scripting out two or three different rebuttals to the objections they get, so when they do get them, they know exactly what to say to overcome them. In other words, they are rarely caught off guard, because they know what to say to deal with them.</p><p> Third, because top producers know what the objections or stalls are likely to be in advance, and since they are prepared for them with solid scripts and techniques to overcome them, they are able to take advantage of the timing of &ldquo;when&rdquo; to handle an objection. Unlike most sales reps who feel they have to handle an objection the moment they get one (and hence instantly lose control of the call), top producers realize that they have three options as to when to handle an objection. They are:</p><h3> 1) When it comes up. Again, because top producers know what to say and how to effectively deal with objections, they have the choice of handling the objection when it comes up or of postponing it for later: <br/>  </h3><p> The first choice may be to handle the objection when it comes up. This is usually good if the prospect is rejecting a product or service at the beginning of the pitch because they haven&rsquo;t been through all the details (features and benefits) of the pitch yet.</p><p> The way to handle this is to use a script, of course. But the key is to handle the objection and then move back into the pitch. An example would be if a prospect objects to the price at the beginning. It might go like this:</p><p> Prospect: &ldquo;This is out of our budget &ndash; the price is just too high.&rdquo; (Or any other objection.)</p><p> Rep: &ldquo;You know, it might seem that way now, but the price actually breaks down to about $2.00 per (lead, incident, etc.), and when you look at it that way, it becomes very affordable &ndash; especially when you see how much time and effort it saves you. Let me just show you a couple of things&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> In this example, the rep answered the objection but instead of checking in with the prospect to see how the close landed, they instead kept control of the call by continuing on with the pitch.</p><h3> 2) The second option to handling an objection is to postpone it till the end of the pitch.This is ideal if the prospect seems willing to keep listening but is stuck on an issue or two. The important thing is to acknowledge that you heard the objection and promise to handle that at the end. It goes like this: <br/>  </h3><p> Prospect: &ldquo;This is out of our budget&hellip;,&rdquo; (Or any other objection.)</p><p> Rep: &ldquo;I can understand that but let&rsquo;s do this. Before you make any decision on this, let&rsquo;s talk about all the things this can do for you first, and then you&rsquo;ll be in a much better position to decide if this is worth it for you. I even have some payment options that might make the decision easier for you as well.</p><p> But first, let me show you this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> What you&rsquo;re doing here is delaying answering the objection and thereby retaining control of the call. The nice thing about this is that by the end of your pitch, many times the prospect won&rsquo;t even bring up the objection at all! You&rsquo;d be amazed by how often that actually happens once you begin using this technique.</p><p> In addition to this, if you know what the objection(s) are at the beginning of the pitch &ndash; or in the middle &ndash; you can begin pitching and building value around the known problem area (objection).</p><p> Postponing answering the objection like this is a great way to get your pitch in, keep control of the call, and prepare yourself for what you know might be coming at the end.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 3) The third time to answer an objection is&hellip;never! That&rsquo;s right. So many time prospects will test you and try to put you off with many questions, stalls and objections that it&rsquo;s just best to not respond at all. Here&rsquo;s how you do that: <br/>  </h3><p> Prospect: &ldquo;This is out of our budget&hellip;&rdquo; (Or any other objection.)</p><p> Rep: &ldquo;Some of our clients felt like that until they heard about&hellip;&rdquo; (Now give a benefit or two and keep pitching).</p><p> This way you&rsquo;ve acknowledged the objection but you remain positive and so sold on your solution that you let your enthusiasm drive the call &ndash; and often times your prospect&rsquo;s mindset. It is said that enthusiasm sells, and that&rsquo;s true in many cases. The problem with most sales reps is that as soon as they hear an objection they start to give up.</p><p> But by acknowledging, remaining positive, and continuing on with your pitch, you can often override any initial objection and get further into your pitch. In fact if you&rsquo;ve done this before, then you&rsquo;ll often find that the prospect changes to a different objection the next time they bring one up!</p><p> These three times to handle an objection also work for questions as well. The important thing to remember is that it is up to you as to when to break your rhythm and deal with an objection. The whole point is that you must remain in control of the call.</p><p> Try using the techniques and scripts above during your upcoming week of pitching your product or sale. You&rsquo;ll be amazed by how much easier your sale becomes &ndash; and how many more deals you&rsquo;ll get.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-22 16:49:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-22 16:49:48.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_MfdnMOm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/top-sales-producers-how-they-view-and-react-to-objections-differently/\", \"post_id\": \"11978\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-22 16:49:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-22 16:49:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"top-sales-producers-how-they-view-and-react-to-objections-differently\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11977\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5826\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Top-Sales-Producers-How-They-View-and-React-to-Objections-Differently.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"838\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466683200,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

Hopefully, this person will have some background in writing. You content guru will be the one in charge of developing and repurposing content across your channels.

Whilst much of my writing has been focused on the importance of the communication relationship between a company and the customer, I have not been as vocal about the almost equal criticality of the communication between a company and it&rsquo;s employees.</p><p> On a regular basis &ndash; and almost increasingly so &ndash; I come across people who appear to be confused about a number of things &ndash; and I am not talking about their lives outside of the work environment!! When I ask these people very simple questions, more often than not they seem incredulous as to the right answer. For example, have you ever asked someone what their company does. The response should not be complicated, but watch people squirm as they try to find the right descriptive words.</p><p> In an era where it is perfectly possible for any human to find out the answer to almost any question under the sun via the simple click of a mouse or &lsquo;swipe&rsquo; of a screen, these same humans do not know the fundamentals of what the companies they work for on a daily basis actually do. The major cause of this bizarre scenario is (in my opinion) a significant lack of communication between leaders of organisations and their employees.</p><p> This lack of communication is not exclusive to the subject of Customer Experience &ndash; it relates to most things companies do. Too many things concocted in swanky board rooms by &lsquo;men and women in suits&rsquo; (many of whom are unlikely to have good, accurate and real time information about how their customers and employees &lsquo;feel&rsquo; about the company) are done so in intentional secrecy. The dark art of &lsquo;strategy&rsquo; is played like a complicated game of chess, but a game behind closed doors and without any video cameras. I apologise to any &lsquo;man or woman in a suit&rsquo; who may be reading this &ndash; I am being slightly antagonistic and facetious &ndash; but sometimes a point needs to be made in a light hearted manner to bring a subject to life.</p><p> Please do not confuse my jocularity for ignorance &ndash; I am completely understanding of certain key decisions being made without the interjection of anyone but those people paid significant sums of money for having the experience and skill set to do so.</p><p> However&hellip;.. there is always one of those &ndash; when it comes to making decisions that have a direct impact on the experience that a company intends to deliver to its customers &ndash; failure to effectively communicate these decisions to the people who actually deliver the experience is a major error.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> I have seen some quite brilliant descriptions of organisational purpose in recent times &ndash; clear; simple; meaningful &ndash; descriptions that enable every individual in the business to understand the role they play in delivering the Customer Experience. Yet it is almost inexcusable that most people in these organisations have never seen it. Leaders, like their employees, have become so focused on fulfilling tasks, that they forget to communicate the point of why they are doing the task in the first place.</p><p> That is why I believe that you simply cannot &lsquo;over&rsquo; communicate with anything that is core to your business AND customer strategy. If you want your people to buy into your strategy; to support it; to be advocates of it; they need to know what it is and what it means for them &ndash; what you want/need them to actually do. If you have the intention of becoming a more customer-centric business &ndash; you need to tell your people. Not once. Not in a poster on a wall that quickly becomes a &lsquo;dust gatherer&rsquo; &ndash; but continuously &ndash; indefinitely.</p><p> Over the years I have communicated the importance of Customer Experience to the companies I have worked within almost to the point of irritation (I am sure there are many who may agree!!) &ndash; I have done so because as a leader committed to helping the organisations I work with to genuinely achieve their customer-centric goals, I know how important it is to continuously instil the message &ndash; instil it until the message has become embedded into the psyche of those you are communicating to &ndash; until mindsets have been fundamentally shifted.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Communicating the Customer Experience needs to be continuous, innovative and engaging. I and brilliant teams of people have done some quite radical things to get the message across. In 2010, two of my amazing colleagues came up with a communication campaign that we ended up calling &lsquo;Feet in the Street&rsquo;.</p><p> Working for an online retailer, we were very conscious of the fact that many employees had never actually had the opportunity to &lsquo;see, touch and feel&rsquo; the experience our customers were having on a daily basis. So, to bring it to life in the most effective way possible, we re-created the customer journey in the centre of our head office building.</p><p> With an enormous red stiletto shoe as the centrepiece, foot prints on the floor led our people through real life displays of the four stages of our customer journey. It was brilliant (even if I do say so myself) and a fantastic way of keeping Customer Experience &lsquo;front and centre&rsquo; in the minds of our people.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-22 17:07:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-22 17:07:38.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_ynSGDmM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-theres-no-such-thing-as-over-communication-in-customer-experience/\", \"post_id\": \"11982\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-22 17:07:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-22 17:07:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-theres-no-such-thing-as-over-communication-in-customer-experience\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11981\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5828\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-Theres-No-Such-Thing-as-Over-Communication-in-Customer-Experience.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1619\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466697600,"author_id":200,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5600,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Implications of Brexit: A Detailed Viewpoint","link":"implications-of-brexit-a-detailed-viewpoint","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The upcoming referendum today in the United Kingdom (UK) - on whether or not the country should leave the European Union (EU) - looms as the biggest potential &lsquo;known-unknown&rsquo; risk to global capital markets in the immediate future. Thanks to recent poll gains made by the Leave campaign, the prospect of &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo; has emerged as a very real possibility.</p><p> The decision to leave the EU is a tremendous one for the British people. The UK accounts for 13% of the EU&rsquo;s population and about 15% of its economic output. To put this into perspective, Brexit would be akin to the entire Northeast region of the United States, including the financial hub of New York, choosing to secede from the union because they pay a lot more in taxes to the center than the benefits they receive in return. The key issue is that while the British people are aware of the pros and cons of being in the EU (at least on the face of it), there is considerable uncertainty about the counterfactual, i.e. what British life would look like outside the union. While it is impossible to fully discern all the ramifications of Brexit, some of which may become clear only over a decade or so, we believe it is worthwhile to try and unwrap some of the issues the UK will have to deal with in the event of a negative vote. Even if Remain wins, the Brexit genie is now out of the bottle and the central question - to leave or not to leave - will persist. We begin with a brief history of UK - EU relations to shed some light on how the UK reached this point, and what that implies going forward.</p><h3> How the UK got here</h3><p> <br/> After a couple of attempts at membership in the European Economic Council (EEC) during the 1960s, both of which were vetoed down by France&rsquo;s Charles DeGaulle, the UK eventually entered the club of European nations in 1973.</p><p> Membership in the EEC was in fact put to a referendum (the current Brexit vote is not the UK&rsquo;s first official poll on EU membership) in 1975, and was overwhelmingly supported by 67% of the British public. However, it is important to understand that voters in 1975 were hoping that membership in the EEC would mitigate some of problems faced by the UK during that decade, such as industrial decline, union strikes, power outages and high inflation amidst the oil crisis. A different, more economically powerful Britain exists today in the minds of the public, a point we will come back to.</p><p> Since the 1970s the UK has had an uneasy relationship with the EU. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher negotiated a rebate on Britain&rsquo;s EU contributions in 1984, making the argument that it received much less in agricultural subsidies than other members (France being the largest recipient). Yet, on February 7th 1992, UK Prime Minister John Major (also from Thatcher&rsquo;s Conservative party), signed the Maastricht Treaty along with leaders of eleven other members of the European Council, essentially creating the European Union and the Euro currency (which Britain opted out of).</p><p> Crucially, the Maastricht treaty was never put to referendum in the UK, unlike in France, where it barely passed with 51% of the vote, and in Denmark, where it took two tries. In fact, uncertainty over its ratification led to considerable turmoil in currency markets in late 1992. The UK ended up withdrawing from Europe&rsquo;s common exchange rate mechanism (ERM), which sought to reduce exchange rate variability and promote monetary stability, after failing in its fight against currency speculators.</p><p> The Maastricht treaty was eventually ratified by the British parliament in 1993, but just barely so, as members of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s own party rebelled and put his government in serious danger of falling. At the time, former Prime Minister Thatcher was quoted as saying that John Major had &lsquo;put his head in the fire&rsquo; by signing the treaty.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/british-gdp-per-person.png\" width=\"724\"/></p><p> The intervening years between Maastricht and the upcoming referendum saw a pro-Europe Labor party in power, as well as the signing of the social chapter of the EU treaty (which governed employment) by Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p> The Brexit vote is a direct result of Prime Minister David Cameron&rsquo;s promise in January 2013 that, if his Conservative party were reelected in the May 2015 elections, he would renegotiate Britain&rsquo;s membership in the EU and hold an in-out referendum by 2017. While Cameron did attempt the renegotiations after his re-election, a final deal was elusive, and on February 20th of 2016 he set June 23rd as the date for the referendum.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Why Leave has gained momentum</h3><p> <br/> A confluence of factors has made the idea of Brexit more attractive to the British public over the past few years. Even people following the Brexit debate only marginally probably know that concerns over immigration have fueled support for the Leave campaign.</p><p> At the same time, it is important to point out that immigration by itself is not the only reason the Leave campaign has garnered wider support, especially among British elites. The desire for independence from a European Union hobbled by regulations and crises have come to the forefront as well, along with questions of national sovereignty. One hundred and fifty members of parliament, far from a fringe minority, support Leave as of this writing.</p><p> The concerns that drive the Leave campaign will not go away immediately, and hence, we believe it is worthwhile delving a little deeper into the issues that have sent the UK down this potential rabbit-hole.</p><h3> <strong>  Immigration </strong></h3><p> <br/> The key concern is that the current immigration regime allows an unfettered open door to other EU residents and only by leaving the EU can the UK regain control over its borders. The free movement of workers is one of the four fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Article 45 of the European Commission Treaty. Under these rules, any citizen from the other twenty-seven countries in the bloc can enter the UK without a visa to look for work or flee oppressive economic or political circumstances.</p><p> In recent years, net immigration into the UK has risen dramatically on the back of the country&rsquo;s relatively strong economic recovery after the Financial Crisis of 2008, reaching a near record 330,000 individuals in 2015 according to the office of National Statistics. Leave campaigners claim that the EU&rsquo;s free movement policy is chiefly responsible for this, and that stricter restrictions on migrant inflow would protect British jobs as well as boost stagnant wage growth.</p><p> On the other side, Remain activists contend that this is simply fear mongering, citing the fact that immigrants from the EU actually compose a smaller proportion of total inflow than those from nonEU states in South Asia and Canada. Further, they emphasize the boost to UK productivity, output and employment as a result of skilled and enterprising immigrant populations.</p><p> Currently, non-EU immigrants account for just over fifty percent of total net migration into the UK. Since 2010 however, inflows of immigrants from EU member countries have risen sharply. A significant portion of this recent influx has come from Bulgaria and Romania, causing a shift in immigrant population demographics.</p><p> These newer immigrants tend to be less skilled and more culturally separated, occupying rural areas and low-income urban neighborhoods. The apparent, unsubstantiated, causality between migrants taking advantage of open borders and domestic economic ills (like stagnant wages) has resulted in increasingly xenophobic public sentiment in Britain.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/migration.png\" width=\"517\"/></p><p> However, there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that immigration is solely responsible for slow wage growth. The UK has experienced tepid wage growth since 2008 (as has the U.S. we note), with wages not growing much above 2% annually. The movement of net migration correlates poorly with wage growth data, suggesting that the decline has more to do with sluggish global growth than with liberal immigration policies.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/earnings.png\" width=\"511\"/></p><p> The central principle underlying the Leave campaign&rsquo;s proposed model alternatives is the idea that Britain should be able to determine the size and composition of its immigrant population. They advocate a system wherein the UK can tailor their border policy to best suit the country&rsquo;s economic needs. For instance, some have proposed a points based scheme that evaluates visa applicants based on their English language skills, employment, age and education. Only those applicants who secure a certain number of &lsquo;points&rsquo; awarded on these criteria would be granted entry into the UK.</p><p> We should note that limiting the labor supply could be negative for an independent British economy. Rising wages and prices may satisfy political demands in the short-term, but they would almost certainly diminish the UK&rsquo;s ability to compete effectively with manufacturers in Asia under an open trade agreement. In order to control labor costs, the government would have to increase the labor force participation rate through investments in education and skills training. Further, it must ensure that British workers are ready and willing to fill the vacuum left behind by immigrants at the lower end of the labor market. It is an open question as to whether the UK can manage this transition adroitly.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Economic Independence </strong></h3><p> <br/> Another argument being made is that the UK has reached a point of economic strength and confidence relative to the EU that makes it possible for it to thrive, let alone survive, unencumbered by EU institutions. In the mind of British voters, the UK of the 21st century is vastly different from the one that existed in the 1970s, when membership in the European community seemed like the obvious answer to a multitude of problems. That the UK will be able to move more nimbly in today&rsquo;s world without being tied to a hobbled, crisis-ridden Europe has recently gained further currency. Since the second quarter of 2009, after the Financial Crisis, growth in the UK has been comparable to growth in the US, and significantly higher than overall growth in a Euro area crippled by austerity and seemingly jumping from one crisis to the next.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fred.png\" width=\"509\"/></p><h3> <strong>  National Sovereignty </strong></h3><p> <br/> The third argument, perhaps even more important, is the idea of restoring full national sovereignty to Britain as opposed to living under the auspices of a supranational European council - especially one that cannot directly be removed by the British electorate if they so desired, unlike in a more democratic system. By leaving the EU, the UK would regain control over various aspects of social and economic policy that were ceded to the European Union under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty.</p><p> We believe it is this argument that has helped Leave gain supporters across the political spectrum, and most importantly, it is this idea that will probably continue to resurrect the possibility of Brexit in the future, <strong>  even if Remain wins this round </strong> . What we are seeing now may only be the beginning of a protracted, perhaps even decades-long, campaign to wean Britain off the EU.</p><p> In the next section we discuss the potential impact of Leave coming out on top. While this question is impossible to answer in its entirety, we can certainly get a sense of the scale and scope of the issues Britain will face in the event of Brexit.</p><h3> <img alt=\"\" height=\"363\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/exports_0.png\" width=\"781\"/></h3><h3> Brexit Impact</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  Trade and the Economy </strong></h3><p> <br/> The United States is the UK&rsquo;s single largest trading partner, accounting for 11% of total exports in 2014. Collectively, however, EU countries remain the chief export destination of British goods, absorbing about 51% of the UK&rsquo;s export volume. Note that exports made up about 28% of UK GDP as of 2014.</p><p> Since 1973, the UK has benefited greatly from membership in the European single market. Under its rules, goods can move freely between any of the twenty-eight member states, unhindered by tariffs and other barriers. By proxy, the UK also profits from the fifty trade agreements the EU has signed with nations outside Europe. In the event of an exit, the UK must either negotiate a comprehensive Free Trade agreement (FTA) with the EU, or engage with the single market under WTO rules. If Britain is unable to secure a deal with the EU, it will be forced to rebalance its exports away from Europe and towards the United States and other large markets like India and China.</p><p> Thus, the future of the UK economy heavily depends on the adoption of a liberal, post-exit trade policy, as well as on reaching some sort of an agreement with the EU. Given that Britain imports more from the EU than it exports to them, one imagines that the EU would have some incentive to expedite this.</p><p> Yet the political fallout from a potential Brexit cannot be ignored. Germany&rsquo;s hawkish finance minister Wolfgang Schauble employed some harsh rhetoric recently, reminiscent of his attitude during the Greek debt crisis in 2015, saying &ldquo;In is in - out is out&rdquo;. The UK should not expect any good will or compromises (again, as in the case of Greece), if they choose to leave.</p><p> The idea is that Britain, or any other member state, entertaining the notion of leaving the EU sets a dangerous precedent and must be made an example of with devastating consequences. Germany, and perhaps even France, it seems, will have no qualms about employing the EUs set of economic weapons to &lsquo;punish&rsquo; Brexit. At the same time, this is exactly the sort of rhetoric that will continue to push the UK further away - if not now, then at some point in the future.</p><p> If the UK were unable to strike a deal with the EU, they would find themselves facing an incredibly uncertain economic future. Under such a scenario, there would be even more pressure to pursue free trade agreements and deregulate extensively. Of course, this would be a struggle. In a recent visit, President Obama of the United States (US) urged the British to remain in the union, remarking that an independent Britain would be &lsquo;at the back of the queue&rsquo; when it came to negotiating a free trade agreement with the US.</p><p> While the US is the single largest domestic market for British goods, its own consumption-oriented economy is hardly reliant on the UK, accounting for just 3% of its total export volume. Further, the export sector contributes just a little more than 13% of American GDP.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> All of this points to an alarming truth about the British economy. If cut off from the EU&rsquo;s single market, it possesses very little bargaining power in the international trade environment, and will need to undertake substantial reform in order to be competitive. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) estimate that the economy would experience at least a 1% reduction in 2017 if the public voted to leave, and that by 2020 the nation&rsquo;s GDP would be 6% smaller than it would have been had it remained in the EU.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trade-relationships.png\" width=\"757\"/></p><p> So how likely is this bleak economic scenario? This depends on the kind of deal the UK can finally negotiate with the EU. The graphic on top of this page details three models for a potential partnership between Britain and the EU.</p><p> It is important to note that in the event of Brexit, the UK would continue to retain the benefits of membership for two years to hash out the terms of a divorce. This prevents the possibility of an abrupt, hard restructuring of the economy, mitigating adverse economic effects as firms, households and markets adjust their expectations over the interim period.</p><p> At the same time, as we explained earlier, members of the EU will be reluctant to make things easy for Britain. They will in all likelihood reject any proposal to allow the UK to remain in the single market without continuing to maintain an open door pass for EU citizens. This will obviously create political havoc in the UK, especially since a prime motivator for Brexit is closure of the very same door.</p><p> Not having access to the single market will also have dire consequences for London&rsquo;s status as a financial center. This is a key reason as to why business services and the finance sector are most in favor of Remain amongst industries, while construction, agriculture, forestry and fishing are most in favor of leaving.</p><h3> <strong>  Capital Markets </strong></h3><p> <br/> Global capital markets have become increasingly jittery as Leave swung into the lead, with currency markets experiencing significantly higher volatility. In February, after the date of the referendum was announced, the pound fell to a seven-year low against the dollar. Since then, the currency has rallied on market expectations that Britain would vote to remain in the EU, but recent poll gains by the Leave campaign have induced a further drop in the pound.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"237\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/british-pound.png\" width=\"518\"/></p><p> Equity markets have not been completely immune either. UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 saw a drawdown of more than 7% between April 20th and June 14th, a period in which Leave gained significant momentum. We should point out that only about 25% of companies listed on the FTSE 100 come from within the UK. The rest are multinationals that will benefit from a devalued pound.</p><p> The tension has carried over to global equity markets as well. The European equity index basket, Euro Stoxx 50, fell more than 10% over the same period. U.S. equity markets were less directly impacted, with drawdowns close to 3%, but there has been a spike in volatility. The CBOE volatility index (VIX) jumped more than 40% over the first two weeks of June, as odds grew that Leave could win.</p><p> At the same time, bond yields across the world have continued to plunge, as investors look for safe assets amid increasingly pessimistic views on the global economy and the ability, or rather inability, of Central Banks to provide sufficient and/or effective monetary stimulus. We do note that UK bond (Gilt) yields have also fallen almost 50 basis points since the end of April (to 1.15 as of June 17th). This does suggest that while investors are worried about the implications of Brexit on the UK economy and trade relations, these concerns do not extend to the full faith and credit of the UK government to repay its bondholders.</p><h3> <strong>  Monetary Policy </strong></h3><p> <br/> The Bank of England issued a fresh warning on Thursday, June 16th, saying that Brexit could result in the UK sliding into a recession. The central bank said that spending has already reduced over the threat of the UK leaving the EU. Lower spending can subsequently lead to lower demand for labor and raise the unemployment rate (currently at 5.1%). Governor Mark Carney warned that Brexit could send the pound sharply lower, raising inflation and unemployment.</p><p> The Bank of England is already in the process of implementing contingency measures in the event of Brexit. The central bank plans to hold additional auctions of sterling to ensure that the banking system has enough funds to operate under that scenario.</p><p> The UK is also facing its largest current account deficit in peacetime since 1772, standing at 7% of GDP at the end of the first quarter of 2016, versus 5.2% for all of 2015. A deficit this large should lead to a fall in the currency, irrespective of the outcome of the Brexit vote.</p><p> In theory, a cheaper currency would help rebalance the economy by making British exports cheaper on the global market, and imports more expensive - narrowing the deficit. Then again, imports becoming more expensive could lead to higher inflation, even as UK exporters who use imported raw materials for their products face higher costs. So some of the competitive advantage of a cheaper currency would be lost.</p><p> A combination of influences on demand, supply and the exchange rate could potentially lead to a materially lower path for growth and a higher path for inflation. All of this could potentially put the central bank in a precarious position, having to choose between stabilizing inflation and employment.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Political Impact </strong></h3><p> <br/> Five out of twenty-one cabinet members (other than the Prime Minister himself) have openly campaigned for Leave, against the stated position of the Prime Minister, which is quite unprecedented. If the vote goes against Remain, we may well see David Cameron announce his intention to step down on Friday morning after the vote. It is highly unlikely that he will stick around to negotiate the terms of Britain&rsquo;s exit from the EU over the next two years.</p><p> The other issue is that of Scotland, which is significantly more proEuropean than the rest of the country. We may well see another push for independence should Brexit occur. The last referendum for Scottish independence, held on September 18th 2014, ended with 55.3% voting against it. However, the result may be different if Britain chooses to severe ties with Europe.</p><p> In any case, the political turmoil promises to be considerable if Leave wins, along with a not insignificant likelihood of the United Kingdom itself breaking up, with Scotland eventually choosing to go its own way.</p><p> The Big Question: How does Britain Navigate the Legislative Complexities?</p><p> European Union laws course through several veins of British law currently, including immigration, asylum, employment, agriculture, competition, regulation and environmental laws and standards, amongst others. These laws touch every facet of life in the UK. A Brexit vote will not instantly extricate the UK from this web of influence. In a recent report on Brexit, Lord Bosewell, chair of the House of Lords EU commmittee said:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"89\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-22-at-10.06.50-AM.png\" width=\"479\"/></p><p> All this would have to be done without creating a slew of new legal vacuums. EU provisions, including standards and regulations, will have to individually reviewed and subsequently retained, amended, or repealed. All the while keeping in mind that Britain&rsquo;s largest trading partner would continue to be the EU, at least in the short to medium-term.</p><p> For example, if Jaguar wanted to sell UK made cars in continental Europe, they would still need to meet EU emission standards, in which case these would have to bow directly be put into domestic law. Similarly, EU based consumer protection laws, say to prevent credit card fraud, would have to be enshrined into UK domestic statutes, or else they would disappear upon withdrawal from the Union.</p><p> Another example: Agriculture and fisheries, which cannot be ignored even though they account for less than 1% of domestic output in the UK, would require creation of an entirely new regulatory framework.</p><p> The Leave campaign has been supported by sides that have traditionally found themselves diametrically opposite each other. One side is anti-immigration, anti-globalization, and for national sovereignty while the other supports even more economic liberalization, small government and opposition to subsidies. Presumably, all of these disparate forces would have to come together and decide on the best course of action regarding practically every single statute.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/flag.png\" width=\"452\"/></p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> Britain leaving the EU may well emerge as one of the most consequential events in recent history. As the vote looms closer, political tensions have reached an all-time high in the UK, peaking with the tragic murder of Pro-EU Member of Parliament Jo Cox. This has shocked the country and led to more subdued campaigning in the days leading up to the vote.</p><p> While most forecasts expect the crop of undecided voters to break toward Remain over the last few days, the final margin may be fairly slim. Thus, irrespective of the outcome, Britain is sure to experience divided public opinion in the years ahead. As we mentioned earlier, the issues that propel the Leave side, such as immigration, economic independence and national sovereignty, will not simply disappear if Remain wins. Campaigners pushing to sever ties with Europe are likely to push for more referendums on specific EU treaties going forward, even if they cannot get another shot at a Brexit referendum in the short term. The rise of populism combined with the cloud of an ambivalent Britain remaining within the EU will create much uncertainty over the next decade or so, hampering overall growth.</p><p> In an effort to understand the dynamics of the conflict, this paper has placed the upcoming referendum within the historical context of relations between the United Kingdom and Europe. We have outlined several immediate, as well as long-term, implications of Brexit on the UK economy. Post-withdrawal, Britain is likely to experience difficult structural transformations that will almost certainly contract economic growth in the short-term. The labor market may well face significant constraints if a new immigration policy that is more restrictive is enacted. Trade relations will also have to be rebalanced, causing considerable chaos and uncertainty for business in the UK, and for Europe as well. We discussed scenarios that lay out the multiple routes Britain&rsquo;s political economy could take with respect to their relationship with the EU and the rest of the world.</p><p> It is impossible to unpack all the potential complexities of Brexit, but our goal was to gain a better understanding of the size and scope of the issues involved. Much of this work is speculative, far more dependent on the political cross-currents in London and Brussels than on economic theory. Come June 23rd, Britain will have an answer to the immediate question of separation, but it is far from likely that this will be the last time the question is asked. So irrespective of the outcome, expect turbulent times ahead for Britain and the European Union.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-22 17:11:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-22 17:11:08.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_G0QZ9Bh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/implications-of-brexit-a-detailed-viewpoint/\", \"post_id\": \"11993\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-22 17:11:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-22 17:11:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"implications-of-brexit-a-detailed-viewpoint\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11983\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5829\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Implications-of-Brexit-A-Detailed-Viewpoint.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1274\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466834400,"author_id":158,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5601,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"21 Ways to Gain a Competitive Advantage for Your Firm","link":"21-ways-to-gain-a-competitive-advantage-for-your-firm","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Finding a differentiator for your professional services firm is not an easy task. Many firms struggle mightily only to come up with a differentiator that doesn&rsquo;t really differentiate them at all.</h3><p> <br/> To be successful, a  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/developing-differentiators-how-research-can-help-you-pass-the-test\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  differentiator must meet three important criteria </a> :</p><li> It must be true. You can&rsquo;t simply make it up.</li><li> It must be important to potential clients. If not, what&rsquo;s the point?</li><li> It must be provable. If you can&rsquo;t demonstrate that it is true, it won&rsquo;t be believed. <br/>  </li><p> The sad reality is that most differentiators fail on at least two of these criteria.</p><p> But take heart. There are many successful differentiators. Here are 21 that work for many professional services firms. And remember, you can have multiple differentiators. They can be combined to  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/differentiation-guide-for-professional-services-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  create a powerful competitive advantage </a> .</p><h3> 1. Specialize in an industry.</h3><p> <br/> This is perhaps the easiest and most successful differentiator for most firms. Clients value the specialist in their industry. But be careful. If you try to specialize in too many industries, you will lose credibility.</p><h3> 2. Specialize in serving a specific role within your client&rsquo;s organization.</h3><p> <br/> This role-based specialization is also quite successful, especially if combined with an industry focus. If you head IT at a law firm, it&rsquo;s comforting to know that your service provider specializes in helping people just like you.</p><h3> 3. Specialize in offering a particular service.</h3><p> <br/> This is also quite successful, especially if the service you specialize in is rare and hard to find. But beware, unique service offerings can quickly become mainstream. Witness Sarbanes-Oxley compliance or  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/the-top-10-benefits-of-using-social-media-marketing-for-business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  social media marketing </a>  as two recent examples.</p><h3> 4. Offer a truly unique technology or process.</h3><p> <br/> By truly unique, we do not mean your process that starts with assessment and ends with monitoring results and making adjustments. We mean an approach that is a whole different way of approaching the problem that offers a unique benefit to the client.</p><h3> 5. Focus on understanding a particular target audience.</h3><p> <br/> A key differentiator for some firms is their in-depth understanding of a particular audience. Your firm might specialize in marketing to Baby Boomer women. Your clients might be retirement planners, insurance companies, or clothing retailers, for example.</p><h3> 6. Specialize in serving clients of a certain size.</h3><p> <br/> This is a common differentiator, although some folks don&rsquo;t think of it as such. Perhaps you work exclusively with the largest companies in the world. Contrast that with a firm that focuses on solo practitioners. Either firm could have a competitive advantage over the firm that serves clients of all sizes.</p><h3> 7. All of your staff shares a specific characteristic or credential.</h3><p> <br/> Everyone feels like they have a great team. So it&rsquo;s tough to make that stick as a differentiator. But what if all of your programmers hold PhDs in Computer Science? That is both provable and meaningful to a potential client. Or perhaps all your project managers are PMPs. Not as distinctive, but also provable and relevant.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 8. Specialize in clients that share a common characteristic.</h3><p> <br/> This differentiator is focused on a characteristic of your clients other than their industry or role. Let&rsquo;s say you provide accounting and tax services for expatriates.  They might be from any country, in any industry or any corporate role, yet you will have a competitive advantage.</p><h3> 9. Focus on solving a specific business challenge.</h3><p> <br/> Here, the spotlight is not on the client as much as on the nature of the business challenge they are facing. To work, it must be a challenge that is easily recognized and tough to solve without specialized skills and experience. Helping firms secure their first government contract is an example.</p><h3> 10. Have one or more individuals who are Visible Experts℠ in their fields.</h3><p> <br/> This is a time-tested strategy that works very well. Having the country&rsquo;s top expert in your specialty is a very powerful competitive advantage. Many firms have been built on this differentiator alone. Add multiple  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/the-visible-expert\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  high visibility experts </a>  and you will have a compelling and very valuable brand.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 11. Offer a unique business model.</h3><p> <br/> Everyone in your profession bills by the hour, but you offer a fixed fee. Voil&agrave;, a perfect differentiator is born! A  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/creating-the-ultimate-differentiator-tools-for-business-model-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  unique business model </a>  can be both meaningful and easy to prove. But be watchful. If it works well, you are likely to accumulate imitators.</p><h3> 12. Have a specific geographic focus.</h3><p> <br/> This is a very traditional differentiator that is losing some of its punch as technology and common business practices are making geography less important. But take heart, it can still work in situations where local knowledge or face-to-face interaction are still seen as important by potential clients.</p><h3> 13. Offer access to a unique set of information not available elsewhere.</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes, access to certain information can be very valuable to potential clients. Do you have benchmarking data that no one else possesses? Some firms have built very valuable practices around proprietary data not easily duplicated.</p><h3> 14. Offer a unique set of contacts or relationships not easily accessible.</h3><p> <br/> While the previous differentiator focused on information, this one is focused on relationships. Public relations firms have long used relationships with reporters and editors as differentiators. What relationships can your firm bring to the table?</p><h3> 15. Do business with a distinctive level of service.</h3><p> <br/> In most cases, offering good client service is simply the price of entry. Everyone does it, or claims to. So to become a differentiator, your level of service really has to truly stand out. Can it be done? Indeed, there are still some physicians who make house calls.</p><h3> 16. Distinguish yourself by the clients you have.</h3><p> <br/> Having an impressive client list is a plus for many firms. But what if you take it further? Some firms differentiate themselves based on their client list. For example, if your firm serves the higher education market and your clients are Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, you have a differentiator.</p><h3> 17. Focus on the size of your firm.</h3><p> <br/> We are the largest&hellip;fill in the blank. Size sends a signal that you are doing something right in the minds of many potential clients. This combines nicely with a specialization to show both relevance (the specialty) as well as success (the largest). Find a niche and dominate it.</p><h3> 18.  Emphasize your relationship with a parent firm or partner.</h3><p> <br/> A close relationship with a parent firm can be a limiter (potential clients may feel like you cannot be objective about other technologies for example). But for other potential clients, it can be a big asset. Who knows the ins and outs of the technology better? This same differentiator might also be applied to situations where your firm is a value-added partner rather than a subsidiary.</p><h3> 19. Focus on a notable signature accomplishment.</h3><p> <br/> Some firms can  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/the_brand_building_guide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  build a strong brand </a>  based on achieving a notable accomplishment. Firms that invented a technology or solved a highly visible problem for a very well known client are good examples. This type of notoriety can be leveraged throughout an industry and over time.</p><h3> 20. Specialize in producing a unique or very valuable result.</h3><p> <br/> Similar to number 9, where you focus on a notable business challenge, this differentiator focuses on a valuable result. The key difference is that you may need to overcome multiple business challenges to produce the valuable result. For example, you might specialize in  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/spiraling_up_create_a_high_growth_high_value_professional_services_firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  turning average growth clients into high growth firms </a> . This could involve solving a wide range of business challenges, rather than a single one.</p><h3> 21. Look or act differently than all of your competitors.</h3><p> <br/> Most professional services firms tend to look and act a lot like their competitors. Why? Perhaps you have been in the industry for a long time. Or perhaps doing things very differently feels risky. We see this all the time.

{"original_id":5602,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Feedback is Critical to Every Financial Advisor Practice","link":"why-feedback-is-critical-to-every-financial-advisor-practice","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Unless you want to grow your business, don&rsquo;t do feedback. Your Challenge: How do I create a formal feedback process and why? <br/>  </h3><p> Your Opportunity: Advisors who have a formal feedback process typically earn more than 10-50% more than advisors who don&rsquo;t have a client feedback process.</p><p> According to The FPA Financial Planning Association in the United States (Source USA FPA Research and Practice Institute study - Future of Practice Management -December 2013 ) 85% of advisors do not have a formal feedback process. Similar research by Business Health Australia (Source Business Health Pty Ltd. 2013 US Advisors Key Value Drivers USA* 85% of advisors do not have a formal feedback process. Are you kidding me? This leads me to two questions, why and why not?</p><p> The reason why not is because, up until now it has not been an important process for advisors. The top 15% who do feedback earn 10-50% more than advisor who do not have a formal feedback process. So why not have one?</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s examine three ways you can build a feedback process: <br/>  </h3><li> Surveys</li><li> Formal feedback process</li><li> Client board of directors <br/>  </li><h3> 1. Surveys <br/>  </h3><p> Surveys can come in many forms and with online software programs that can help you ( check with compliance because of confidentiality and privacy rules first) create a regular feedback process. There are practice management and coaching companies that may also have software or tools to help you create a process. Here are a few tips. First keep it simple and brief and you will get more responses.</p><p> Second, while surveys sent back to you for feedback are helpful, anonymous surveys ( surveys sent to a third party for data collection and confidentiality) allow your clients to be totally honest as their comments will not reflect back on them jeopardizing your relationship. Third, benchmark your client feedback against your peers to digest how your practice is doing in the marketplace. Collect client comments, no matter how small they are, their words will help you build a better practice.</p><p> What questions do you ask? What feedback are you looking for? How do you want to deliver the surveys, email, phone, mail or other? This is where you should consider hiring a firm to help you. Check with you company or practice management team or website provider to help you find options.</p><h3> 2. Creating a formal feedback process <br/>  </h3><p> This process will help you improve your unique value proposition and implement key strategies to grow your business. To improve your unique value proposition, we first need you to talk to your top 10 clients and get solid feedback from them. <br/> Select 5-10 client progress meetings in the next month with your ideal client win-win profile. If you want to start with clients you know well, and will give you good feedback, then select them first. Then select clients you would like to discuss for serious feedback .Ask five to ten clients for their feedback on your value and their experience. At the end of a progress meeting with these clients, ask them a question to get started such as: I am building an updated unique value proposition and could use your help. Can I take five minutes to ask you four questions? There are 4 KEY questions to ask</p><p> 1. What are the 3 things that you value the most about our services? (Ask both husband and wife and write them down as women and men vary in what they truly value) Note this is a double conundrum question. Conundrum number one, your client&rsquo;s may not know how to answer this because they have never looked at your business that way and conundrum number two is men and women will usually answer it completely differently.</p><p> 2. How important are these 3 things to your family's financial future? Are they important, very important or critically important? Is there anything else that is critically important? (this question may open up other discussions about planning or critical issues in their lives such as troubled children&rsquo; health problems or other concerns in their subconscious)</p><p> 3. What is it worth to you? (Usually they ask what do you mean, say the EXACT same question again, What is it worth to you?) You will be very surprised by the answers you get here. I will hold you in suspense, because it is worth waiting for.</p><p> 4. In our progress meetings, what is one thing that we can improve on to make our time more valuable and a better experience?</p><p> What you are asking is, how can we improve our progress meetings, since clients sometimes do not see a lot of value in them for the fees they pay. Is it 50 minutes talking about hockey and 10 minute of planning? How can we get better? How does this compare with your other professionals such as your accountant? Some responses you will receive will be the more or less category, such as more reports or less paper. There will be small items, but there will also be big issues that will help you propel your business more than anything else I say in this book. Doing this exercise with hundreds of advisors has helped practices more than any other idea, because it is from a client&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Then sit back and say, I value your comments, as we are rebuilding our value proposition and client experience to serve you better, we could use your help. How could we serve you better and improve the experience you have with our firm? What do you clearly value? How often do you want to see us? How can we make the progress meetings time more valuable and improve your experience? (Add in any question you feel important)</p><p> Now you have implemented the feedback process into your business. You have received feedback from 10 of your top clients and possibly additional prospects) and they have given you their level of confidence in the value you deliver. The bad news is it may not be 100% but that is the good news, they have told you where your potential blind spots are and given you valuable feedback to improve your business. I think this is more value than the price of any business book, and then some. You are on your way to building a world class practice based on feedback from your top clients and they value they receive. Now is a good time to write out 10 names and start building your world class practice and unique value proposition through feedback.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 3. Client board of directors <br/>  </h3><p> I am always asked, how did you build your practice? What is the one process that stands above all others that helped you grow your business. It was creating a client board of directors, as I discussed in previous practice management posts, the best practice management idea you will ever read. It was feedback from ideal clients that helped me build my business. That is why I am so passionate of any form of feedback including feedback questions at progress review meetings ( which I did) and creating not one but several client boards for feedback ( which I did) . In the end I did all three methods of feedback because I let my clients direct me and help me grow my business (which yours are willing to do and will enjoy helping you in the process).</p><h3> Can I ask for your help? <br/>  </h3><p> Try asking your ideal client this question at your next meeting. I need your help in developing my business? Can you help me out? What will there answer be. You have helped them and their family become financially secure with your comprehensive planning, and are extremely grateful of your services that they are willing to help you out. Now that you know my secret to how I grew my business, you could shut your computer or smartphone down and never return and become the success that you desire through ideal client feedback. <br/> One final question. Do you have a written client feedback system to see what your clients value the most about your services? Do you complete this annually and discuss with your top clients and staff?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-23 14:59:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-23 14:59:48.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_fj6s4Ti.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-feedback-is-critical-to-every-financial-advisor-practice/\", \"post_id\": \"11997\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-23 14:59:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-23 14:59:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-feedback-is-critical-to-every-financial-advisor-practice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11996\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5831\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-Feedback-is-Critical-to-Every-Financial-Advisor-Practice.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1206\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466758800,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

When we are asked to do something that points immediately to a weak area, we may cringe but we know it&rsquo;s even worse to not try. So we do our best knowing the results may not be stellar. And so it was today that I attempted to fulfill a simple enough request but the outcome left something to be desired.  </p><p> The following advice applies directly to advancing your career or building a more robust business, and is certainly sales related.  As others see you embracing these success strategies, your actions will signal a strong personal brand as well as imply excellence in customer service.</p><p> &ldquo;Learning becomes the momentum to propel us forward.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  My Story </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> I was asked to film a video tour of a property. It seemed like a very straightforward request. The only problem is, I view things from a creative standpoint instead of technical.</p><p> It seemed to me that in order to capture the essence of each room, a wider view would help considerably. So I turned the camera sideways to film half of the rooms comprising the property. Watching the film later in the day, I recognized the requesting party would have to turn his head sideways in order to enjoy the film. It was my turn to make a request, and that was that he laugh!</p><p> On the upside of the embarrassing situation, the younger people also reviewing the property claimed they were both unable to send videos via email because the files always seem to be too big.

Try <br/>  </h3><p> Although it&rsquo;s easier not to try, the problem is, if we don&rsquo;t try, we will never improve. </p><h3> 2. Laugh <br/>  </h3><p> Early attempts make us feel foolish at times. The best remedy is laughter. Once we do, we&rsquo;re ready to move forward.</p><h3> 3. Learn <br/>  </h3><p> As we humbly move past these hurdles, there are excellent lessons to be learned in many regards.</p><h3> 4. Try Again <br/>  </h3><p> Understanding where the trouble spots reside, it&rsquo;s easy to fix and try once more.</p><h3> 5.

These include ways other insight skills can help. For example with problems like getting your multi-channel interactions optimised.</p><p> As we&rsquo;ve shared before, Holistic Customer Insight is much more powerful. It benefits from the synergy of using data, analytics, research &amp; database marketing together. Previous posts have focussed on how this approach helps proposition development or marketing measurement, but database marketing can also benefit.</p><p> Understanding from research the &lsquo; <i>  felt experience </i> &rsquo; of your customers in response to targeted comms or inbound prompts, can help improve their design. Improved analytics and data visualisation can help both improve targeting &amp; spot unintended consequences of optimisation.</p><p> So, for this post, I&rsquo;m returning to the world of reviewing other data, analytics &amp; research related blogs. Sharing videos or articles I think should be of interest, to those leading database marketing or insight teams.</p><h3> <b>  How is data visualisation developing? </b> <br/>  </h3><p> I suspect most of you have heard of IBM Watson Analytics, the research and products from IBM under the brand of their Machine Learning champion. What IBM chooses to call a &lsquo;data discovery service&rsquo;.</p><p> It&rsquo;s encouraging to see the team there now engaging with wider topics of interest to those working with analytics (beyond just more advanced AI or modelling algorithms). Their &lsquo;Expert Series&rsquo; of YouTube videos is worth watching. They are short &amp; include a good range of different analytics experts &amp; pundits.</p><p> A recent episode is this video focussed on trends in Data Visualisation. Good to see Randy Krum share from his real experience in this area. Given the need for database marketers to engage with new ways to better understand complex multi-channel performance data, these developments should be very relevant. Well-designed interactive data visualisations surely have the potential to transform dull &amp; sometimes obscure campaign reporting:</p><h3> <b>  Can Machine Learning deliver the optimisation you need? </b> <br/>  </h3><p> An even hotter topic than data visualisation, as you&rsquo;ll have seen on social media, is Machine Learning. It seems like almost every vendor now feels the need to offer something in this space of express an opinion.</p><p> There are also a lot of useful resources out there, including those I&rsquo;ve shared on Twitter &amp; Google+ (e.g. courses &amp; resources from Jason Brownlee)</p><p> Of particular relevance to Database Marketers, is the potential for Machine Learning (AI) algorithms to learn how to best optimise leads. Lots of bloggers will talk a good theory in this regard, but this very helpful tweet from Per Harald Borgen shares how he did it. He includes APIs &amp; scripts used to prepare data and develop the model. Well worth a look if you&rsquo;re tackling multi-channel leads &amp; how they can be optimised.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <b>  Are brands being damaged by tech-led customer research? </b> <br/>  </h3><p> Brand research can sometimes feel like the other end of the spectrum of customer insight skills, from the commercially minded database marketers. Pragmatic DBM analysts can view such research as somewhat fluffy or high-level and perhaps not of relevance to their work.</p><p> However, a clear understanding of how a brand is perceived &amp; impact of interactions and campaigns on brand sentiment can be key to improving that impact. Without an appropriate programme of research, database marketers risk being blind to the emotional impact &amp; recall being prompted in customers by their messages.</p><p> Many organisations have been keen to benefit from technology developments in research (inc. survey) execution. This is often because of the promise of reduced costs &amp; faster delivery. However, this post from Jeri Smith sounds an important alarm as to the risks of being led by such technology options.

Yet, many of the challenges firms have faced in the late 90's still exist today.   <br/> <br/> Spanning these two decades, our report accurately predicted key trends such as the impact of technology disruption, cost pressures, and the rise of social impact investing. However, for as many predictions we got right, we had not foreseen the Financial Crisis and its related impact on regulatory oversight, the delay in Asia-Pacific overtaking North America in HNWI population and wealth, and the persistently high levels of cash held by HNWIs. <br/> <br/> None-the-less, today, I am very honored to have the opportunity to release Capgemini's 20th Anniversary of our annual World Wealth Report. We have interviewed thousands of senior executives in the wealth industry and tens of thousands of HNWIs and wealth managers across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific since the inaugural report was launched in 1997. Each year we make great strides in continuing on the excellence of our previous work, but finding new ways to enhance the valuable insights we can share with the industry and our clients.</p><h3> <strong>  After years of speculation, Asia-Pacific has now passed North America to become the region with not only the most High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI), but also the most wealth held by HNWIs.  <br/>    </strong>  </h3><p> Asia-Pacific achieved this in commanding fashion with a HNWI wealth growth over 4x (9.9%) that of North America (2.3%). In fact, nearly 60% of the newly minted HNWIs world-wide came from China and Japan.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"537\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chart-1.png\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> The Asia-Pacific HNWI population is now 5.1m individuals holding US$17.4 trillion, compared with North America at 4.8m and US$16.6 trillion.  Given the current pace of growth, the total HNWI wealth worldwide could rise from US$58.7 trillion in 2015 to over $100 trillion by 2025.  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chart-2.png\" width=\"800\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Despite slower growth, big opportunity still exists with only 1/3 of HNWI wealth managed by a wealth manager </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Huge gains were made in rebuilding HNWI trust and confidence in their wealth management firm (17 percentage point increase to 74%) and Financial Markets (30 percentage point increase to 61%).  However, trust and confidence levels in HNWI's wealth managers' plateaued with only a 2 percentage point increase to 59%.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"454\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chart-3.png\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> The industry can take credit and solace that their efforts and investments to regain the trust of the clients is starting to pay off. However, the trend is also disturbing for wealth managers.  In a time where a wealth manager's value proposition is being challenged and roboadvisors are gaining steam, the pressure is on for wealth managers to truly deliver a differentiated, holistic wealth management service.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Demand for digital is not only coming from HNWI clients, but also from wealth managers </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Over the past two World Wealth Reports, we have showcased how important digital capabilities are to HNWIs, especially for Informing and Transacting activities.  And while this is largely driven by the younger millennial generation, we found demand for digital was strong for Gen X and Baby Boomers as well. With rare exception, most industry executives have historically noted their biggest challenge was getting their older wealth managers to buy into leveraging new technology. This now seems to be shifting as we found over 80% of wealth managers are demanding access to digital tools.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chart-4.png\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> However, what is really concerning is only 45% of wealth managers are satisfied with the digital tools and 39% are likely to leave if they are not satisfied with the digital capabilities of the firms.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chart-5.png\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> And more importantly, 73% of HNWI clients across the globe note that the digital maturity of their wealth management provider has a significant impact on their likelihood to increase the amount of their assets they invest with a firm.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chart-6.png\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> This is becoming even more important as HNWIs comfort level with automated advisory services (aka roboadvisors) is on the rise.  Last year, 47% of HNWIs across the globe noted an interest in investing in a roboadvisor capability.  That number rose to 67% in 2016.  Yet, only 31% of Wealth Managers believe their HNWI clients would consider using an automated advisory service.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chart-7.png\" width=\"800\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Capgemini's DigiWealth Maturity Assessment Model is a diagnostic tool which examines digital capabilities from three perspectives:  Firm, Client, and Advisory. </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Our analysis based on self-assessments by senior industry executives highlights the industry has only achieved moderate levels of digital maturity to-date.  And given these are self-assessments, it is very likely that actual maturity levels may be substantially lower if analyzed independently.  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chart-8.png\" width=\"800\"/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chart-9.png\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> However, the good news is wealth managers have noted higher levels of satisfaction with digital tools than they did just a few years ago.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-23 16:13:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-23 16:13:08.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_KOQlsEd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-can-be-learned-from-20-years-tracking-wealth-management-trends/\", \"post_id\": \"12012\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-23 16:13:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-23 16:13:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-can-be-learned-from-20-years-tracking-wealth-management-trends\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12002\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5834\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/What-Can-be-Learned-from-20-Years-Tracking-Wealth-Management-Trends.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1343\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466827200,"author_id":63,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5607,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Whose Side Is Your Financial Advisor On?","link":"whose-side-is-your-financial-advisor-on","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adviceperiod\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AdvicePeriod </a></p><p> Imagine you must choose between two restaurants&mdash;one with a Department of Health letter grade&mdash;&ldquo;A&rdquo;&mdash;in the window, and the other with no grade in sight. It&rsquo;s not a hard call: All else being equal, you&rsquo;ll head to the restaurant whose cleanliness and quality aren&rsquo;t a matter of mystery.</p><p> The world of restaurants is a lot like the financial advice industry. In one category are traditional brokers, many with conflicted, murky compensation practices&mdash;like restaurants with no letter grade. In the other category is a smaller but growing group of Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs), including AdvicePeriod, who are legal fiduciaries&mdash;the group proudly hanging an &ldquo;A&rdquo; in the window. Fiduciaries are bound by law to serve clients&rsquo; best interests.</p><p> Unfortunately, it is not that easy to tell which financial professionals are on your side&mdash;after all, they don&rsquo;t actually come with letter grades or other clear labels. What&rsquo;s more, brokers often muddy the water by calling themselves &ldquo;advisors,&rdquo; &ldquo;consultants&rdquo; or &ldquo;planners&rdquo;&mdash;anything but &ldquo;brokers.&rdquo; Yet brokers and fiduciaries are as different as those two restaurants.</p><p> Just like car salesmen and real estate agents, investment brokers earn commissions for each sale they make. And they face constant temptation to steer clients toward the products with the fattest payouts&mdash;that&rsquo;s just human nature. AdvicePeriod&rsquo;s preference is to charge our clients a fixed fee&mdash;freeing us to offer advice that is in our clients&rsquo; best interest, with no economic horse in the race.</p><h3> Brokers are regulated by their own industry, which does limit them to selling &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; products. But the suitability standard leaves plenty of room for conflicted behavior, as a 2012 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research made clear.</h3><p> <br/> In the study, hired actors asked brokers to evaluate portfolios that the researchers had created. The brokers routinely recommended changes, even to solid portfolios not in need of change. And they pushed high-cost mutual funds over lower-cost index funds. Do you think a broker&rsquo;s advice is impacted by how they get paid?</p><p> Unfortunately, consumers are frequently not aware of the material differences between brokers and fiduciaries. We often hear, &ldquo;But surely a broker is required to inform their clients of potential conflicts of interest.&rdquo; No, they&rsquo;re not. Brokers are not required to disclose information to their clients which highlights important conflicts of interest and would empower a client to make the best decision.</p><p> On the other hand, fiduciaries, such as RIAs, are legally required by federal and state governments to put clients&rsquo; interests ahead of their own. Crazy notion, right? They must do what is in their clients&rsquo; best interest. As a client, you should not accept anything less.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Fiduciary advisors face far fewer conflicts than brokers because they sell advice, not products, and charge fixed fees rather than sales commissions. Should a conflict of interest arise, fiduciary advisors are required to disclose it promptly and clearly. Not so with brokers.</p><p> Lately, the federal government has been championing the fiduciary standard. In early April, the Department of Labor (DOL) attempted to expand the application of the standard. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking to bring brokers under the same strict standards that govern RIAs.</p><p> To the surprise of no one, the brokerage industry is fighting these efforts tooth and nail&mdash;so the outcome is up in the air. Thanks to the broker&rsquo;s powerful lobbying efforts, the DOL ruling was a watered down and marginally useful expansion of the standard with the potential to cause more harm to consumers than good. The government&rsquo;s inability or unwillingness to make the fiduciary standard the only acceptable practice is hard to fathom.</p><p> As a result, it&rsquo;s consumers, along with the professionals who counsel them, who can make the biggest impact. Reserve your patronage for fiduciary advisors who are truly on your side.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-23 16:18:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-23 16:18:14.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_WvMAkXJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/whose-side-is-your-financial-advisor-on/\", \"post_id\": \"12016\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-23 16:18:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-23 16:18:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"whose-side-is-your-financial-advisor-on\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12015\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5836\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Whose-Side-Is-Your-Financial-Advisor-On.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"575\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466762400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5608,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do You Possess These 11 Qualities That Make Great Sales Leaders?","link":"do-you-possess-these-11-qualities-that-make-great-sales-leaders","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> One of the biggest factors in improving sales performance are the individual sales leader qualities. <br/>  </h3><p> Independent research, including our own at RAIN Group, has clearly shown that great sales managers and leaders have a massive and disproportionate impact on win rates, sales force motivation, retention of key sellers and &ndash; interestingly &ndash; seller mindset and motivation.</p><p> In short, if you want better sales results, focus on hiring better sales leaders.</p><p> But what exactly makes a &ldquo;better sales leader&rdquo;? What are some sales leader qualities that you should be looking for when deciding who to hire in key positions inside your organization?</p><p> From experience and research, I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of 11 qualities that make a great sales leader. But don&rsquo;t think of this list as exhaustive. Think of it as a place to start.</p><h3> #1. Transparency <br/>  </h3><p> Great sales leaders (and great leaders in general) are transparent about their objectives, goals and motivations. They don&rsquo;t play political games, or keep hidden agendas. They tend to read like an open book, and be clear about what they are trying to accomplish, and what it&rsquo;s going to take.</p><p> A great sales leader doesn&rsquo;t hide from the facts, either. If the road ahead is tough, he (or she) will be up front about the challenges, and the journey to get to where they need to go.</p><h3> #2. Confidence <br/>  </h3><p> Great leaders are confident, especially in the face of chaos and uncertainty. This doesn&rsquo;t mean they operate with blinders on, or refuse to be open up to input and criticism from others.</p><p> It simply means they have a quiet, inner compass that guides their actions and lets them know they&rsquo;re on the right track. They exude confidence, but mixed in with a little humility. They&rsquo;ll welcome input from others, but will ultimately make up their own mind.</p><h3> #3. Focus <br/>  </h3><p> As I&rsquo;ve had to discover for myself, focus is a key aspect of success in any area of life and business. If you truly want to excel at something, you&rsquo;ll need to invest in that area to the exclusion of everything else. At least for a time.</p><p> As Daniel Goleman (author of the appropriately named book &ldquo;Focus: The Hidden Driver Of Excellence&rdquo;) says, &ldquo;One way to boost our will power and focus is to manage our distractions instead of letting them manage us&rdquo;.</p><h3> #4. Inspiration <br/>  </h3><p> Great sales leaders don&rsquo;t just build focus for themselves &ndash; they are able to inspire others to focus as well. In short, they act as an inspiration to their teams, their peers and their organization.</p><p> This doesn&rsquo;t mean that every sales leader has to live up to the image of the stereotypical &ldquo;charismatic leader&rdquo; (whatever that is). It means they are able to inspire others &ndash; through their words, actions and behaviors &ndash; to follow in their footsteps.</p><h3> #5. Kindness <br/>  </h3><p> I find that kindness is a word underused in business. At its purest, it simply means to go easy on others when the situation calls for it. True leaders know when it&rsquo;s time to take the foot off the gas for a moment, and simply &ldquo;sit down&rdquo; with someone.</p><p> They understand that &ldquo;when the going gets tough&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not always &ldquo;the tough who get going&rdquo;. They see that it&rsquo;s often in those moments of adversity that we have a rare opportunity to connect with our teams on a deeper, personal level, and forge strong connections that last a lifetime.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> #6. Passion <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s no leadership without passion.</p><p> People don&rsquo;t follow those without passion, because there&rsquo;s nothing to follow.</p><p> Great sales leaders are passionate, and they express that passion on a daily basis. Passion for results. For clients. For their people. For their products.</p><p> Being a nay-sayer is easy. Being passionate is not.</p><p> Great leaders find their passion within themselves, and bring it out to the world.</p><h3> #7. Open-mindedness <br/>  </h3><p> If confidence is a key quality for any sales leader, then open-mindedness is a close second. Without an open mind, confidence turns into dogmatic thinking. It closes us off to the world, to second opinions and to alternative (and often better) options.</p><p> Open-mindedness is like the conscious of confidence. It keeps us honest, flexible and humble.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> #8. Persistence <br/>  </h3><p> Without the power of persistence, passion and focus are simply words. It is often in the passionate pursuit of our goals that we connect with our higher selves, transcending our own boundaries, and inspire others to do the same.</p><h3> #9. Accountability <br/>  </h3><p> Truly genuine leaders have not only high hopes, but high expectations. They religiously set goals for themselves and their teams, and monitor progress closely.</p><p> There is no duality in their thinking. You either achieve, or you don&rsquo;t. And if you don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;d better be a good reason why. No excuses. No fluff.</p><p> True leaders hold everyone &ndash; themselves first &ndash; accountable for results. Because they know that failing to achieve ultimately means failing ourselves.</p><h3> #10. Restlessness <br/>  </h3><p> Great sales leaders are never satisfied with the status quo. They relentlessly seek to do better. Improve. Tweak. Aim higher. Shoot further.</p><p> Someone once told me that great leaders have &ldquo;just enough anxiety&rdquo;. Where I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the word &ldquo;anxiety&rdquo;, there is a kernel of truth in there. Great sales leaders are always looking to push the envelope &ndash; in essence, that&rsquo;s what makes them great.</p><h3> #11. Balance <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s a reason why our planet has seasons. Games have half-time. Day has night.</p><p> We all need time to regenerate, re-energize and resource ourselves. Great leaders understand that the world doesn&rsquo;t function in full throttle alone, and neither do their teams.</p><p> They understand that a good life is a balanced one. With plenty of time for work and play.

{"original_id":5609,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Financial Companies CAN Get Leads from Social Media!","link":"financial-companies-can-get-leads-from-social-media","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Financial companies out there, listen up.</h3><p> <br/> With one third of professionals on planet Earth using LinkedIn, and almost 30 billion LinkedIn profile views in Q3 of 2014, it&rsquo;s pretty clear what the most powerful business website in the world is.[1] Yet hedge funds, broker-dealers, financial advisors, and investment managers insist that their clients are not using these websites, so trying to generate leads on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter is useless.</p><p> (Pause). So while it&rsquo;s obvious that this is not a true statement, the more interesting question to ponder is why are they attesting to its veracity? There are a few reasons.</p><p> First of all, hedge funds, broker dealers, and investment managers are heavily regulated entities that must have marketing materials compliance approved, for the most part, before dissemination. Adding another layer of administrative burden, they must submit all public advertisements (over a certain amount of people solicited) to the regulators. What this means is that software like Global Relay must be used to archive and record these communications, and marketers must work with the Chief Compliance Officer before anything goes out. So it is perhaps this additional workload that takes the fun out of tweeting. Annoying, but not impossible to overcome.</p><p> The second reason that many financial companies are ineffective at social media lies within the very definition of the word social. Let&rsquo;s face it, everyone. There are exceptions, but the financial industry on the whole ranks typically a 9.5 on the arrogance scale (10 being the highest possible score.) So to ask a financial company to interact pleasantly with people, in writing nonetheless, where tone can be easily misconstrued, is like inviting the bull to dance in the china shop. Some of the bigger hedge funds hire a marketing person to handle the task of socializing with the public. This marketing person does usually have good manners, unlike the analysts who work at the firm (see folks, I keep it real), but that person might not have an analytical background. People with true marketing skill and financial knowledge are really hard to come by &ndash; these are two completely different skill sets. So often the marketing content becomes diluted and the hedge fund can&rsquo;t differentiate itself to a sophisticated investor. For many of the smaller funds, broker dealers, and RIA firms, there is no marketing support and the analytical people have to write their own materials. This tendency for smaller shops to wing it has lowered the level of marketing skill in the industry as a whole. High net worth investors have become accustomed to dull, dry, stale, deceptive, and overly theoretical 40 page pitch books which is why they&rsquo;ve tuned out.</p><p> If hedge funds were to use social media, they&rsquo;d have to step their game up and find something creative, engaging, and relevant to say. But right now, they all say the same thing and it&rsquo;s this inane line &ldquo;our fund exhibits stock like returns with bond like volatility.&rdquo; The statement is too stupid for words. What does that even mean, anyways? What number exactly does stock-like return represent? What standard deviation qualifies as bond like volatility? And the worst thing about this statement is that none of the hedge funds did this in the year 2008! Almost all of them acted like stocks when they were supposed to act like bonds and due to leverage they in fact exhibited volatility higher than the stock market itself! You&rsquo;re not fooling any of us, you hedge funds, we saw your true colors the last time that market crashed and you all went down with it (and then some)! So stop trying to deceive us and you&rsquo;ll probably get more credibility.</p><p> Most of those hedge funds were casualties of the 2008 market collapse and the people who used to sell them are now selling portfolio analysis software at Morningstar or MSCI index data subscriptions to put their kids through college. Rightfully so. Maybe it is a good thing because clearing out all the junk might enable hedge funds to start saying something worth listening to. And when they do, they&rsquo;ll get the massive following and the leads on social media that they aren&rsquo;t right now.</p><p> Listen up, hedge funds, broker-dealers, and investment managers; if 41% of millionaires use LinkedIn and 57% are on Facebook[2], the high net worth investors are out there.</p><h3> They ARE on social media and they are ripe for the taking, but you&rsquo;ve got to swallow the compliance regulation pill, get creative, and step your game up. <br/>  </h3><br/>[1] Bullas, Jeff. &ldquo;25 LinkedIn Facts and Statistics You Need to Share.&rdquo; December 2, 2014. http://www.jeffbullas.com/2014/12/02/25-linkedin-facts-and-statistics-you-need-to-share/<br/>[2] Frank, Rob. &ldquo;Millionaires prefer Facebook over Twitter&rdquo;, CNBC, July 18, 2014. http://www.cnbc.com/id/101846130","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-23 16:23:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-23 16:23:28.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_vOVmD0W.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/financial-companies-can-get-leads-from-social-media/\", \"post_id\": \"12020\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-23 16:23:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-23 16:23:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"financial-companies-can-get-leads-from-social-media\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12019\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5838\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Financial-Companies-CAN-Get-Leads-from-Social-Media.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"708\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466758800,"author_id":424,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5610,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Strategies Firms Must Follow to Help Next-Gen Hires Bring in Business","link":"6-strategies-firms-must-follow-to-help-next-gen-hires-bring-in-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> At most advisory firms, the founders are the primary rainmakers. They seem to have this innate, magical ability to bring in new business, and their entire firms have grown up around them to support them in that role.</p><p> The message to many of the next-generation hires, meanwhile, is that &ldquo;you either have this innate skill or you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; But what can firms do if they want to foster and build a business development culture? If you want all your advisors to develop new business, you&rsquo;ll need to create a firm culture that makes generating sales a way of life &mdash; for the entire firm.</p><p> Many firm owners share stories of frustration when it comes to getting advisory staff to take on the vital role of developing new business. They think the answer lies in the compensation structure &mdash; but I believe it takes more than monetary rewards to build an organization focused on successful business development.</p><p> The answer lies in implementing these six key strategies.</p><h3> 1. EMBED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EVERYWHERE <br/>  </h3><p> Make business development a part of everything the firm does, and something that is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility.</p><p> Business development activities and expectations must be formally written into job descriptions; make it clear that generating new revenue is a part of the job. Set clear expectations and provide regular feedback.</p><p> Then create specific goals that can be tracked regularly and frequently &mdash; something essential to sales success. To drive action and create accountability, consider activity-based goals: number of phone calls made, meetings attended or referrals collected.</p><p> Activities drive results, and you can also measure and reward those &mdash; such as new clients and net new assets.</p><h3> 2. HIRE INTELLIGENTLY <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t force people on your team into a sales role if they are not suited for it. It is important to ensure you have the right people taking on the tasks most appropriate for them. Selecting the wrong people to go out and network with prospects, or to speak in public, can be disastrous for both the individual and your business.</p><p> Instead, understand the characteristics and traits associated with successful sales professionals, and then hire people who match that profile.</p><p> In virtually any industry, most successful salespeople tend to be relentlessly persistent, strongly oriented toward goals and accomplishments, inquisitive and attentive, and passionate and enthusiastic about their industry and offering. In addition, they always take responsibility for their results.</p><p> I would argue that these traits and characteristics are not trainable. Rather, your best tactic is to screen and hire individuals who possess several (if not all) of these attributes. Then you can play to your team&rsquo;s strengths and avoid setting people up for failure.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 3. SUPPORT YOUR TEAM <br/>  </h3><p> Training and coaching are the key elements of success in cultural change. It is important that everyone in your firm understands why clients should choose your firm over your competitors &mdash; and is able to articulate this to prospects with a high degree of confidence and conviction.</p><p> So make sure you&rsquo;re arming employees with the right messaging so they can be successful in finding new clients.</p><p> I recommend that a firm&rsquo;s original rainmakers take on this important role; you could also hire a sales and marketing manager with a proven track record of success as a &ldquo;player coach.&rdquo; Whoever performs this critical function, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure the entire firm gets training and coaching.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4. COMMUNICATE <br/>  </h3><p> Champion the business development cause vocally and frequently.</p><p> The leaders of your firm should motivate the team and create engagement by communicating regularly, discussing new business goals and reporting the progress that is being made toward quarterly, semiannual and annual goals.</p><p> Make sure everyone knows the firm&rsquo;s business development plan and their role within that plan.</p><p> Business development is a process that takes time &mdash; particularly when you are starting out &mdash; and results do not come overnight. That makes it even more important to celebrate smaller milestones and reward those who contribute to the firm&rsquo;s achievements.</p><p> But don&rsquo;t just celebrate successes: Identify the areas in which the firm has fallen short, and discuss changes that can be made to improve performance.</p><h3> 5. RETHINK FIRM PROCESSES <br/>  </h3><p> To support the business development process, you&rsquo;ll need to invest in the right organizational structure, tools and resources.</p><p> Ask yourself: What have you done to free up your lead advisors so they can spend more time working with client referrals and prospects? If your organizational structure does not provide your advisors with leverage by using junior advisors and administrative support, and your top advisors spend all of their time serving existing clients, how much time can they realistically commit to developing new business?</p><p> To be successful, advisors need to allocate time every day to business development activities. Does your structure include marketing staff and resources to assist them in their efforts? To what extent are you utilizing your CRM solutions to free up advisors&rsquo; time?</p><h3> 6. PAY FOR SUCCESS <br/>  </h3><p> Compensation plans don&rsquo;t manage people&rsquo;s performance; people manage their own performance. Many of the firms that contact my firm about creating a sales incentive plan have an existing plan in place &mdash; but often it hasn&rsquo;t paid out in a long time (if ever). And most of those firms are not addressing this lack of achievement with the individual advisors directly.</p><p> Let me be clear: Incentive compensation plans are not a replacement for performance management, active communication and development of your people; they cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p> That said, however, incentive pay has some advantages: It can motivate, align and reward good performers, incentivize specific behaviors and outcomes, communicate powerfully, and align individual and firm results. <br/> Your compensation plans should recognize activity and reward results &mdash; both behaviors and outcomes. Ask yourself what results and behaviors you want. Do you want to reward volume or quality? Team or individual results? Are you looking to drive client satisfaction, client retention, net new assets or net new revenue?</p><h3> WHAT TO REWARD <br/>  </h3><p> A few things that I recommend for using incentive pay to spur business development:</p><li> Only pay for clients that fit your defined target profile.</li><li> Align the actual timing of the payments with the timing of the contribution &mdash; paying quarterly, for instance, instead of at year&rsquo;s end.</li><li> Consider using a hurdle (or stepped) incentive, which will pay out only if a particular target is hit; you can add a higher payout if the target is exceeded.</li><li> Model out the plan to confirm that the business can sustain the payouts over time; nothing undermines a sales culture more effectively than constant changes to a plan&rsquo;s rewards.</li><li> Most important, keep the plan simple: If it becomes too complicated to explain to your team, or for them to track and calculate, it will fail to motivate employees.</li><p> Remember a firm that successfully creates a culture of business development won&rsquo;t have to rely on a few rainmakers to support the entire firm. Each member of the firm, from the receptionist to the partners, can contribute their unique skills and insights to constantly improve existing client relationships and cultivate new ones.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-23 16:25:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-23 16:25:13.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_LUw7qdk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-strategies-firms-must-follow-to-help-next-gen-hires-bring-in-business/\", \"post_id\": \"12022\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-23 16:25:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-23 16:25:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-strategies-firms-must-follow-to-help-next-gen-hires-bring-in-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12021\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5839\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6-Strategies-Firms-Must-Follow-to-Help-Next-Gen-Hires-Bring-in-Business.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"534\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466766000,"author_id":270,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5611,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Have You Considered if Your Leadership Should be a Partnership?","link":"have-you-considered-if-your-leadership-should-be-a-partnership","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;When it comes to partnership, some humans can make their lives alone &ndash; it&rsquo;s possible. But creatively, it&rsquo;s more like painting: you can&rsquo;t just use the same colors in every painting. It&rsquo;s just not an option. You can&rsquo;t take the same photograph every time and live with art forms with no differences.&rdquo; &mdash; Ben Harper</h3><p> <br/> They say that, &ldquo;variety is the spice of life.&rdquo; I believe that this is particularly true in leadership. One opinion; one way of doing things; decisions based on the experience of one person, these can all spell disaster for your leadership. So, here are some of the reasons that your leadership should be a partnership.</p><h3> You don&rsquo;t know it all <br/>  </h3><p> I don&rsquo;t care how educated you are or how long you&rsquo;ve been in the business; you don&rsquo;t know it all! Thinking you know it all will eventually lead to your downfall. But, when you view your leadership as a partnership you can benefit from the experience and knowledge of employees, suppliers, and even clients.</p><h3> You can&rsquo;t do it all <br/>  </h3><p> I don&rsquo;t care how efficient you are or how well you think you can multitask; you can&rsquo;t do it all! When you try to do it all, you eventually become the single point of failure. But, when you partner with others you create a team of qualified individuals who you can depend on to get the job done.</p><h3> Co-creation is superior <br/>  </h3><p> There have been very few times where the ideas, products, and innovation of a single individual have been better than those developed by a team of individuals working together. Since you can&rsquo;t know everything, and you can&rsquo;t do everything, it follows logically that you can&rsquo;t create everything by yourself either. You may have some great ideas, but so might your colleagues. So, why not partner and co-create something superior?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Respect and trust <br/>  </h3><p> When you partner with your employees, customers, and suppliers, you show that you respect and trust them. And, guess what? You will never gain their respect and trust until you give it first. When you partner with others you send the message that you value their knowledge and experience and that you see them as your equals. This is the behavior that builds the respectful, trusting relationships that allow you to succeed as a leader.</p><h3> Develop Partnerships <br/>  </h3><p> I can say with a fair amount of confidence that you will never succeed alone. It takes the support of a group of people to accomplish anything worth accomplishing. Yes, you could treat your people as employees, dictating the work to be done but, true success comes from developing partnerships.

Hat tip to James Lawther for inspiring me to actually flip the tables here and think about emotionally-challenged employees, instead. <br/> <br/> The question I posed in response to his comment on that post was: Why do we transform from humans into robots as soon as we walk into the office building? Unless people are emotionally unavailable and incapable of having relationships before they even walk into the office, why do we suddenly become something we're not? Why can we no longer think for ourselves once we're on the other side of that door? <br/> <br/> At this point, I have more questions than answers about what happens at work. For managers, these questions apply as you think about both employees and customers.</p><li> Why can't you stick to your own morals and values and let them guide you throughout the work day?</li><li> Don't your values align with those of the organization?</li><li> Why do you make life difficult for yourself and for your customers? for your employees?</li><li> Why aren't you thinking of ways to make processes easier for everyone?</li><li> Why don't you push back if someone questions you trying to do that?</li><li> Is this how you run your life? your household? your own finances?</li><li> Is this how you treat your family? your friends?</li><li> Do you talk to your loved ones the same way?</li><li> Do you really lack the ability to express sympathy or empathy?</li><li> Are you emotionally unavailable?</li><li> Do you create rules and policies within your own life and relationships that make it difficult to get along with, or be friends with, others?</li><li> Do you hide your phone numbers and email addresses so friends and family can't find them?</li><li> Do you regularly ignore their phone calls, texts, and emails?</li><li> Do you set expectations, then fall short of them? </li><li> Do you commit to something and then ignore the commitment?</li><li> Do you make promises, only to break them?</li><li> Do you try to earn trust but screw it up? Or don't try at all?</li><li> Do you fail to trust others? or believe they shouldn't be trusted?</li><li> Do you lie to your friends and family?</li><li> Do you forget their names?</li><li> Do you treat them like bank accounts rather than as humans?</li><li> Do you not care about them and simply think of them as a number, not as family?</li><li> Do you fail - or not care - to understand the needs of your significant other?</li><li> Do you forget your manners? Please and thank you? Being responsive?</li><p> The questions could go on and on. The point is, we are all generally good people. More importantly, we are all customers. Someone's customers. We know what it feels like to be a customer. We know how we want to be treated. So why do we do such an awful job of designing and delivering a great customer experience for others, for our customers? <br/> <br/> Do you really have to be told that what you do, regardless of whether you're on the frontline or in the back office, impacts the customer experience? <br/> <br/> Do you really have to be reminded that the company is in business to create and to nurture a customer? And that the customer pays your salary?  <br/> <br/> Why do we turn into robots as soon as we walk into the office building, incapable of doing anything but what we're programmed/told to do, without question? </p><p> ##TRENDING## <br/> <br/> Because of the culture. The leadership. It's toxic, and we do things we're expected to do, despite the fact that those things deviate from our own norms and values and what we believe is right. <br/> <br/> Clearly, there are two things that can happen next, if you find yourself in this situation:</p><li> Get out. There's no alignment with the values of the organization, and there's no culture fit for you.</li><li> Stop yourself. Be different. Be the change you want to see within your organization. Model the behavior that you hope others will aspire to. Be a leader. If no one chooses to follow, revert to #1.</li><p> \"For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday, and lessen the suffering of others.

{"original_id":5613,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Investing 101: Blending All the Available \"Ingredients\" Can Produce the Desired Outcome","link":"investing-101-blending-all-the-available-ingredients-can-produce-the-desired-outcome","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My Kindle is always filled to the brim with new e-books&mdash;many of which I read simultaneously. And while Dorothy L. Sayers&rsquo;s wonderful and classic Lord Peter Wimsey mystery series is perfect for lazy beach reading, what has my attention at the moment is the much more mind-bending  How to Bake Pi: An Edible Exploration of the Mathematics of Mathematics  by Eugenia Cheng.</p><p> Wait! Don&rsquo;t run! What&rsquo;s fabulous about Cheng&rsquo;s approach is how she uses cooking (and, more precisely, recipes) to explain some pretty complex mathematical theories, some of which I think I&rsquo;m fully grasping for the first time. Of course, it&rsquo;s no surprise that my mind immediately began to translate this idea to the world of investing, and I&rsquo;ve already found the analogy of following a well-balanced &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; to be a great tool for introducing some important financial concepts.</p><p> Cathie, a brand new client, came to my office for our first meeting, and before I even had a chance to begin the conversation about her financial needs and goals, she blurted out a big barrier to success: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the stock market.&rdquo; She went on to tell me why. &ldquo;My father taught me the value of  <strong>  real estate </strong> , and that&rsquo;s the only way I want to invest.&rdquo; Whoa. I had to put on the brakes and throw our whole discussion into reverse. And with the help of  How to Bake Pi , I found myself talking about the importance of recipes. And cooking. What I shared was this:</p><p> Investing, quite technically, is &ldquo;the act of committing money or capital to an endeavor with the expectation of obtaining an additional income or profit.&rdquo; And yet investing is just a means to an end&mdash;to reaching your personal goals. Everyone&rsquo;s goals are unique. They might include retiring early, opening a business, putting your children or grandchildren through college, or traveling the world.</p><h3> The options are endless. Whatever your goals may be, it&rsquo;s important to follow the right recipe, blending all the available &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; in a way that produces the desired  outcome .</h3><p> <br/> Think of it this way: flour by itself isn&rsquo;t very appealing. The same is true for salt, a raw egg, vinegar, and baking soda. But when these ingredients combine with others, we can create a vast menu of  outcomes &mdash;anything from pancakes to a buerre blanc sauce to a chocolate pudding. It just depends on the recipe or method we use to get there. Each ingredient presents an opportunity, and the more complex the menu, the longer the grocery list. To determine the best recipe to reach Cathie&rsquo;s goals, we needed to consider every ingredient in our investing &ldquo;pantry.&rdquo; <strong>  Stocks </strong> ,  <strong>  bonds </strong> ,  <strong>  mutual funds </strong> ,  <strong>  real estate </strong> , and more. And it was most important to focus on the desired  outcome &mdash;not the individual ingredients.</p><p> There&rsquo;s chemistry involved in cooking and investing. Taking away  <strong>  stocks </strong>  would be a lot like throwing out the flour and trying to bake a great loaf of bread. Can it be done? Yes. But it surely won&rsquo;t create the same outcome as the recipe with flour. Of course, time plays an important role as well. If the loaf of bread doesn&rsquo;t have enough time to bake, we end up with an inedible, gooey mess. But when we combine the  right  ingredients and bake them at the  right  temperature for the  right  amount of time, the result may even exceed our expectations.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> By the end of our discussion, Cathie agreed to keep our pantry of ingredients full, and I had a clear understanding of her short- and long-term goals so I could determine the most appropriate recipe. I&rsquo;ll certainly include  <strong>  real estate </strong>  as part of the equation since she has a &ldquo;taste&rdquo; for that particular ingredient, but by agreeing to let me toss in the right amounts of  <strong>  stocks </strong>  and  <strong>  bonds </strong>  plus a dash of low-cost  <strong>  mutual funds </strong> , we&rsquo;ve created a time-tested recipe that should deliver just what she&rsquo;s looking for.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-23 18:01:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-23 18:01:16.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_eEV7bmL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/investing-101-blending-all-the-available-ingredients-can-produce-the-desired-outcome/\", \"post_id\": \"12028\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-23 18:01:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-23 18:01:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"investing-101-blending-all-the-available-ingredients-can-produce-the-desired-outcome\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12027\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5842\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Investing-101-Blending-All-the-Available-Ingredients-Can-Produce-the-Desired-Outcome_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"838\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466823600,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5614,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: The Value of Planning is Zero if You Don't Charge for it","link":"advisors-the-value-of-planning-is-zero-if-you-dont-charge-for-it","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIJohnA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  John Anderson </a> | <a href=\"http://www.seic.com/enUS/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SEI </a></p><p> Last week, I got a letter from my accountant. This being June, I was a little excited, thinking that I was being invited to a client appreciation event or he was notifying me of an error that saved me thousands on my tax return.</p><p> Instead, I was disappointed to find that it was a bill. My CPA had the unmitigated gall to send me a bill for his services. Compounding my disappointment, I realized the bill was slightly higher than what I paid last year or the year before that &ndash; the nerve of that guy! After all, what did he do? He only:</p><li> Completed my federal, local and two different state tax forms</li><li> Met with me to go over 2015 and answer my questions regarding certain tax credits that I was eligible for</li><li> Electronically filed my returns and forwarded me both pdf and hard copies</li><li> Made himself available a few times throughout the year to answer questions from my advisor, my wife and me <br/>  </li><p> This CPA billed me for his work and guess what? I paid it. As I was writing the check, I wondered: if I will pay a trusted professional for services that I need and value,  <strong>  why do most advisors shy away from charging for the work their clients value most? </strong>  Why are most advisors not charging for the initial planning work they do?</p><h3> <strong>  How do we charge? </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you look at the client/advisor lifecycle, there is no doubt that the first year is the most important. Typically, advisors work their hardest in the first year, as they are gathering data, organizing clients&rsquo; financial lives and creating a financial plan. It is not uncommon to spend 30 or more hours devoted to each client&rsquo;s financial future in that first year.</p><p> But traditionally, the advisor does that work based on the hope that the client will move their assets over to the advisor to manage for a fee (either transaction or AUM fee).</p><p> I have talked to many advisors who say that they can usually tell if a client will move their assets before they do the work or that it may be too high of a hurdle for some clients to pay a fee for the plan, so they don&rsquo;t charge for the upfront planning work. In fact, in our survey Fees at a Crossroads, we found that only 26% (of 775 advisors surveyed) charged an upfront fee for planning services.</p><p> There is a disconnect here.  <strong>  If we don&rsquo;t charge for planning, are we really a planner in our clients&rsquo; eyes? </strong>  If the client only pays via the AUM or transaction fee, aren&rsquo;t we telling them, through our actions, that the importance of our relationship is really around the investments and not planning? Why do we give away what the client values and charge on what they may not?</p><h3> <strong>  Advice or investments? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s be honest; ongoing AUM fee pricing makes it easy for most advisors. Not having to ask a client for a planning fee eliminates a potentially uncomfortable discussion. The fee is deducted quarterly out of the account, buried in the statement and typically not discussed. But is easier always better, or does deferring the discussion set up a more problematic discussion down the road?</p><p> I&rsquo;m not suggesting that advisors are having difficult discussions with every one of their clients today, but what about the next downturn? What about when clients start seeing fee discussions due to the press, competitors and the government talking about the DOL rule? My guess is that over the next 12 months, many clients are going to be wondering how they compensate their advisors and what they are actually paying for. Are they paying planning fees or investment advice fees?</p><h3> <strong>  Positioning </strong></h3><p> <br/> The good news about our business is that as independent advisors, many of us can experiment with how we price our services. Trying new ideas and strategies on a prospect can give you good feedback about running a better business. For those of you who don&rsquo;t charge a planning fee, maybe it is time to try out a different conversation.</p><p> Here are a couple of ideas that may get you started:</p><li> Before anything else, make sure your custodian has the ability to  <strong>  name the fee type on your statements </strong> . If you can, rename your fee to &ldquo;planning fees&rdquo; or &ldquo;financial planning fees,&rdquo; rather than the more traditional &ldquo;investment advisory fees&rdquo; that typically show up in the statement. Call the fees what they are.</li><li> <strong>  Discuss the value of planning upfront and then charge for that value </strong> . It is an easy way to check to see if the client is committed. If the client balks, are they really the best client for you? Have they fully comprehended the value of the work you do and the benefits of your services? If they don&rsquo;t get it now, will they be a good client in the future?</li><li> <strong>  Discuss the difference between the upfront work and the ongoing planning. </strong>  Need help? See  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/client-service/why-your-clients-cant-distinguish-you-from-other-advisors-and-what-to-do-about-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Why Your Clients Can&rsquo;t Distinguish You from Other Advisors &ndash; and What to Do About It. </a> <br/>  </li><p> Still having problems with the conversation? Try discussing &ldquo;onboarding fees,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;initial planning fees,&rdquo; with the client. By rephrasing the name of the fee, you may be able to show planning as an ongoing event and the upfront fee (where you spend a lot of hours and expertise) as an additional expense.</p><h3> <strong>  Paying for value </strong></h3><p> <br/> As I wrote my check to my CPA, I certainly wasn&rsquo;t thrilled, but I saw value in what he did and paid what he was worth.

{"original_id":5615,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Remember! Clients Are Calling Because They May Need Help","link":"remember-clients-are-calling-because-they-may-need-help","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My colleague and I had no choice but to rent a car one night when a canceled flight left us stranded, five hours away from our destination.</p><p> Two hours into the drive, we encountered what felt like a monsoon. It was then we discovered that one of the windshield wiper blades was bare metal, sans rubber. Though I am a fan of some alternative music genres, metal scraping on glass is not one of them.</p><p> It was pitch black, the only light source coming from large trucks. At times we had to stick our heads out the window to see where we were going. We called the car rental company (a large national chain we all know) for roadside assistance, which amounted to them suggesting we find a 24/7 Walmart. No luck.</p><p> Prognosis: we were down one blade for the entirety of the trip, forced to listen to metal on glass wipe back and forth for hours. It was dangerous and excruciating.</p><p> When we returned the car, we were given a $100 gift certificate (good for one year) and went on my way. I wanted to ask for a free future rental along with a full repayment of my graduate school loans, but the customer service rep was so nice and empathetic I took the gift certificate.</p><p> One year and three days later I needed to rent a car again, but I was told that the gift certificate&rsquo;s expiration was final and &ldquo;absolutely nothing could be done.&rdquo; We can successfully perform a heart transplant on someone but issuing a new gift certificate for a rental car, that&rsquo;s beyond our human capability. For several weeks after I dealt with reps that told me there was nothing they or anyone could do for me. They saw &ldquo;one year&rdquo; and their brain thought, &ldquo;game over.&rdquo;</p><h3> Here was a customer service department deeply rooted in what Carol Dweck calls a &ldquo;fixed mindset.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> If you haven&rsquo;t read  Mindset  yet by Carol Dweck I highly recommend it. I have been rather obsessed with the concept of  fixed vs growth mentalities she outlines. A fixed mindset being one that, in plain terms, believes change is not possible, whatever the scenario. A growth mindset would be one that believes the possibility of change does exist, whatever the scenario.</p><p> If you struggle with your piano lessons at first and have a fixed mindset you&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re never going to get better, it&rsquo;s not going to get any easier, and it&rsquo;s a waste of time. Someone with a growth mindset will approach the task thinking that while it&rsquo;s difficult now the fruits of their labor will ripen later.</p><p> Many of us can feel the hot breath of a fixed mindset when we are on the phone with a customer service representative for a large corporation. If you want something from Comcast or Verizon that involves anything resembling a discount before your plan is up chances are you&rsquo;re not going to get it, but then tell them you want to cancel your plan and suddenly you are transferred to the customer retention department who are leading the way in growth mindset, albeit much to our annoyance.</p><p> It&rsquo;s understandable why large corporate customer service departments would have rules to follow. Without them, there is no consistency. However, perhaps one of the rules should be:</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> &ldquo;Remember that customers are calling because they need help.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> The mantra &ldquo;the customer needs help&rdquo; should pulse throughout customer service departments. When people need help they are in a position of vulnerability. Vulnerable people have their guard up, primed to fight, expecting their needs will not be met. It takes very little to turn a situation from bad to ugly or conversely surprise someone with just a modicum of empathy.</p><p> A fixed mindset in customer service creates a vacuum. It suffocates the interaction between customer and company. A growth mindset breathes oxygen into the conversation, allowing for empathy.</p><p> There is a story I love in Tony Hsieh&rsquo;s book  Delivering Happiness  where he and some Sketchers reps are hanging out in a hotel room and they want to order a pizza but don&rsquo;t know who to call. Hsieh has them anonymously call Zappos to prove how amazing his customer service department is. The Zappos rep they speak with does in fact find them a pizza place in their area that will deliver to them. That type of culture starts with the premise that someone is calling you because they need help. Zappos is not in the business of finding pizza delivery, but they are in the business of customer service.</p><p> After reading  Mindset  I am convinced the fixed vs growth mindset debate is at the core of all failures and successes, whether in business or our personal lives. With a tight fixed mindset every time you get into a fight with your romantic partner you will call it quits. You will then get into that same fight in every subsequent relationship. The fixed mindset will prevent you from ever evolving from that fight. The fixed mindset puts a stranglehold on your personal evolution.</p><p> A growth mindset will lay the grounds for emotional maturity. Even if you don&rsquo;t agree with the other person&rsquo;s point of view you can rise above it and think, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with their argument but what is it they want? Maybe we can get to where we both want to be without insisting the other agrees with us.&rdquo;</p><p> When it comes to customer service, a rep can think, &ldquo;I have to adhere to my company&rsquo;s policy but maybe there&rsquo;s  something  I can do to help.&rdquo; It comes down to the individual. How do you want to lead your life? How stuck or unstuck do you want to feel?</p><p> If you are a customer service rep and someone calls with a request outside of the company policy it is very easy to simply say &ldquo;No.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t have to make up your own rules to have a growth mindset though. The reps I spoke with could have thought, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the power to issue a gift certificate but I empathize with her experience of listening to metal on glass, and being afraid for her life. Maybe I can help her in some way, maybe I can plead her case to my manager.&rdquo;</p><p> This requires more energy and verve. It requires effort. Work. That&rsquo;s where the wall goes up. The aversion to effort blocks our human potential. It&rsquo;s not just about being a good customer service representative, it&rsquo;s about being a fellow human being, listening to what&rsquo;s being expressed to you, and having empathy. And energy!</p><p> There are of course factors other than company policy at play here: how much reps are paid, the success of their personal lives, everything that has happened to them in their respective lives before getting on the phone. All of those experiences combined with their emotional make-up have contributed to them having either a fixed or growth mindset.</p><p> The good news is our stories can be rewritten &ndash; and our brains rewired &ndash; simply by encouraging, training and helping reps have some freedom of thought.</p><p> Which is why it is important to empower your customer service reps to have some freedom of thought. Establish a policy that puts service first and reminds them that people are calling &ndash; not because they love to argue and complain &ndash; but because they need HELP.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-23 18:16:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-23 18:16:25.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_XM6pzFk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/remember-clients-are-calling-because-they-may-need-help/\", \"post_id\": \"12032\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-23 18:16:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-23 18:16:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"remember-clients-are-calling-because-they-may-need-help\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12031\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5844\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Remember-Clients-Are-Calling-Because-They-May-Need-Help.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"643\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466780400,"author_id":156,"chart_url":""}

The ideas and rules may be in your head &hellip; or they may be in constant flux. Either way, it&rsquo;s time that changed.</p><p> Here are 11 good reasons why you and your company need to create clear brand guidelines. A brand guidelines document will:</p><h3> 1. Boost output</h3><p> <br/> Enable different team members, especially in the marketing department, to work more effectively together.</p><h3> 2. Improve consistency</h3><p> <br/> A brand guideline will help ensure that there is consistency across all of your firm&rsquo;s communications, from internal HR emails to client-facing microsites.</p><h3> 3. Spread the word</h3><p> <br/> A formalized and well-designed brand guideline will highlight the importance of the brand in relation to your firm&rsquo;s public image.</p><h3> 4. Provide direction</h3><p> <br/> Provide practical instructions on daily usage, so you&rsquo;ll have to answer fewer questions. Your coworkers will thank you for this clarity.</p><h3> 5. Strengthen reputation</h3><p> <br/> An inconsistent look and feel can weaken your firm&rsquo;s reputation. So provide guidelines that reinforce a positive perception of your company.</p><h3> 6. Guarantee look and feel</h3><p> <br/> Little things, like the regular vs. the narrow version of a font, can have a big impact.

{"original_id":5617,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Here's How to Position Your Portfolio for Brexit","link":"heres-how-to-position-your-portfolio-for-brexit","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://www.oppenheimerfunds.com/advisors/portfolio-manager/krishna-memani\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Krishna Memani </a>  Chief Investment Officer, Portfolio Manager |  <a href=\"https://www.oppenheimerfunds.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  OppenheimerFunds </a></p><h3> With the June 23 referendum on whether Britain should exit the European Union (EU), the so-called Brexit, looming large over global markets, let me start by saying Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Janet Yellen&rsquo;s instinct on how it might play out has proven prescient.</h3><p> <br/> Even when the probabilities of a Brexit were relatively low in the polls, Yellen and the members of the Federal Open Market Committee recognized that there was a chance the vote might end up being closer than everyone thought a few months ago. With that possibility in mind, she prepared the U.S. markets for the likelihood that the Fed would skip a tightening in June because it was too close to the Brexit vote date, and that is exactly how things are playing out. Of course, she probably didn&rsquo;t count on the  <a href=\"https://www.oppenheimerfunds.com/advisors/article/may-jobs-report-derails-june-rate-hike\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  May U.S. payroll data </a>  being a massive whiff, which made Brexit irrelevant for the Fed&rsquo;s June tightening purposes.</p><p> Brexit, however, is the most relevant thing for global markets at the moment. As the probability of a &ldquo;Leave&rdquo; vote has strengthened in the polls, the markets have taken a precarious risk-off turn. Equities are lower, credit spreads are wider, the British pound is down, the Japanese yen is up, and implied volatility has risen all around. The result is a classic risk-off scenario in the global markets.</p><p> The question is what to make of the increasing probability of a Leave vote?</p><p> I don&rsquo;t have any special insight into whether the Leave campaign will carry the Brexit vote. I hope it doesn&rsquo;t, primarily because the near-term impact on the global economy will be quite bad. Economic activity has been slowing on a global basis for quite some time and another shock to the system is the last thing the world needs. While we can debate the magnitude, if the Leave campaign wins it is fair to say that the impact on the global economy and global markets will be negative.</p><h3> Portfolio Positioning Ahead of Brexit</h3><p> <br/> That is the easy part of the analysis. The more difficult and pertinent question, however, is what am I supposed to do with that rudimentary insight for my portfolios ahead of the vote? Given the rise in risk, am I supposed to reduce risk and sit out the vote?</p><p> The challenge is further aggravated by the fact that the Brexit vote will be a binary outcome: the UK either stays in the EU or it leaves. If Brexit fails, the markets will breathe a sigh of relief and probably rally modestly. In other words, any portfolio de-risking may prove to be catastrophically bad. With the flash rally in February fresh in most investors&rsquo; minds, they may not be inclined to do that.</p><p> To answer these questions, I believe I need to go back to my original outlook, with or without Brexit.</p><h3> Global Impact of a Brexit</h3><p> <br/> The world is dealing with deflationary deleveraging issues. A British exit from the EU may compound those issues marginally, but at the end of the day does not materially change things. Growth has been and will remain modest, and global central bank policy support will remain in place with or without Brexit.</p><p> That said, this is unlikely to be a Lehman moment that tips the global economy into a crisis, in my view, for the simple reason that the overall leverage situation is more under control and investors&rsquo; tone and risk taking have been skeptical of the rally. Further, given the increased risk, I am quite sure that central banks worldwide are cooking up contingency plans to support the various economies, including a revival of quantitative easing programs in many countries.</p><p> In other words, there is a reasonable case to be made that while the impact of Brexit will undoubtedly be negative, after the initial drawdown the global economy may stabilize at a modestly lower level and markets will start recovering from that lower level.</p><p> Finally, there is a definite possibility that if the shock of Brexit proves to be too large, the developed world will enter a recession. However, given the state of the global economy-where capital expenditures have been low and consumer leverage is flat to lower on a global basis -such a recession may prove to be relatively shallow.</p><p> Against the backdrop of these possibilities, my outlook had been for low rates, modest returns, and high volatility, even before Brexit, and I structured my portfolios accordingly-modest overweight in risk.</p><h3> Stay the Course</h3><p> <br/> When I weigh the potential for a binary outcome in the Brexit against:</p><li> The potential cost of adjusting portfolios,</li><li> The high cost of buying protection,</li><li> An innate desire not to be too tactical, especially when faced with this type of binary choice,</li><li> A great deal of faith in global central bank policy makers to support the markets if bad things happen, and</li><li> A decent probability that the damage to my portfolio may be modest even with a bad outcome,</li><p> My bottom line is that I am leaving my portfolios unchanged.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-23 19:48:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-23 19:48:07.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_oGpBsIn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/heres-how-to-position-your-portfolio-for-brexit/\", \"post_id\": \"12036\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-23 19:48:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-23 19:48:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"heres-how-to-position-your-portfolio-for-brexit\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12035\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5846\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Heres-How-to-Position-Your-Portfolio-for-Brexit.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"750\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466709300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5619,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Can You Balance Business on the Dirty Road Between I Can and I Will?","link":"can-you-balance-business-on-the-dirty-road-between-i-can-and-i-will","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We&rsquo;ve all heard it before, &ldquo;believe it and speak it&rdquo; or &ldquo;words give things power.&rdquo; My personal favorite touted by my personal development peers, pastors and gurus, &ldquo;Speak life in to what you want and be grateful for it now, in advance.&rdquo; Then there&rsquo;s the notion of, &ldquo;You will attract what you want if you truly want it.&rdquo; Is that right?</p><p> Well, yes. I live by these affirmations that are enforced by the laws of the universe as well. Though, it&rsquo;s not quite as simple as that now is it&hellip; Education, aptitude, experience and faith have shown me a few hidden truths through these past few years.</p><p> One truism is certain, there&rsquo;s a long and twisted dirty road that fills the space between your acknowledgement and belief that you can do something and the achievement of getting said thing, done.   <strong>  Our minds are tormented with distractions, doubts, mini- aha moments </strong> and as one friend likes to say- the hopeium that sprouts on the edge of opportunity that&rsquo;s only a few steps away.</p><p> We venture on this road because we know we can do great things in this world, through business, as leaders and as people who are determined to impact change. We skip out the door excited, hearts racing and determination fueling our steps. Until, we notice the air seemed to get dry and thick a few miles back.</p><p> For some reason, there is radio silence in the air and there is a tension building. We realize that although we are strong, courageous and unwavering we are also becoming increasingly tired of being on the road alone.</p><p> On this road, in this often suffocating air, <strong>  between gasp and deep breaths </strong> to calm us during the shallow times, our mind wanders into pitfalls of comparison. It may not be between ourselves and our peers; in fact, it&rsquo;s most likely between our current self and who we want to be at the other end of the road.</p><p>  For some, its temporary motivation, for others it&rsquo;s immediately draining. You begin to wonder if you have enough fuel in your tank to get you to that other side of yourself. Your pace has changed and your gait is awkward. Somewhat embarrassed by this outward reflection of confusion in your mind, you are aware it&rsquo;s simply a side-effect of breathing in this dirt road air too long.</p><p> With every step, you are <strong>  trying to balance your can, with your doing and your will do </strong> while not faltering. In the background you can hear a few faint cheers muffled by the stifling sound of snarky comments of preferred defeat. Is it in your mind, or is it real? How will you keep moving under the pressure of time and continuously draining energy between right now and one day soon?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 1. <strong>  Hydrate. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Before you go into the sun, kicking open that door of I can to venture out into your journey, make sure you prepare for what&rsquo;s coming. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you should fill your head with a ton of negative thoughts or possible failure points. The same way you should not over drink your H 2 0 before a run, <strong>  do not over think </strong> . However, you do want to drink up in anticipation of what you might do to yourself to prepare a plan of offense. For instance:</p><li> Prepare to cancel the negative talk that will come when you get fatigued with a power statement like, &ldquo;Today I will win.&rdquo;</li><li> Recognize that you may want to stop and pivot toward something less valuable but easier. When those moments come, envision yourself at the finish line of I will that becomes, I have .</li><li> Understand that everyone who comes along with something in their hand won&rsquo;t have good intentions. Many are only interested in borrowing from your energy/resources/network to gain momentum in their own lane. As an advisor recently told me, make sure they earn it first!</li><p>  ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 2. <strong>  Focus. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sounds like another one of those easier said than done statements, however it&rsquo;s key. What you focus on you will find. So keep your eye literally glued to the prize of completion. Yes, shiny objects will bounce in your view, but remember that on this long twisty dirt road they are most likely specs of dust mixed with the glare of illuminated delusion that you secretly hope will convince you to change your course. It&rsquo;s all from fatigue, doubt and wonderment of whether you will obtain your desired outcome.</p><li> When shiny objects come, and they will- ask yourself two questions. <br/>  </li><li> Will this help me become the will that I want?</li><li> Am I looking for a way out of where I am because I no longer believe that I can handle my process? <br/>  </li><li> If you answer those questions honestly, 98% of those shiny objects will flicker away. The 2% that linger may be actual cause of a pivot. However you&rsquo;ll feel an unexplainable peace inside you if those moments occur. <br/>  </li><h3> 3. WHY <strong>  Balance </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> The balance of what you were already juggling before this new door opened is often what people worry will throw their focus off the most. You have family, task, projects, responsibilities, current client or consumer initiatives and prospective opportunities on the rise.</p><p> <u>  Here&rsquo;s the key: </u></p><li> You must have a strong WHY that drives you past doubt, concern and over-apologetic defaults to explain to everyone in your life how you can keep the pace you have in your life and business.</li><li> The WHY must be bigger than you but include a value that will benefit the world.</li><li> Your WHY can include a bit of selfish! As much as your why should benefit the world, you should enjoy the perks of your why as well. Will your why allow you to have financial freedom, time with your family, room for intimacy in your relationship, energy?</li><li> Having a strong, big, selfish WHY adds balance to your life and business, especially on the dirty road between I can and I will. <br/>  </li><h3> So what&rsquo;s your WHY that will balance you on your journey today? <br/>  </h3>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-24 16:24:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-24 16:24:52.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_PbHMtU5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/can-you-balance-business-on-the-dirty-road-between-i-can-and-i-will/\", \"post_id\": \"12040\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-24 16:24:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-24 16:24:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"can-you-balance-business-on-the-dirty-road-between-i-can-and-i-will\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12039\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5849\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Can-You-Balance-Business-on-the-Dirty-Road-Between-I-Can-and-I-Will.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1392\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467043200,"author_id":357,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5620,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Race Against Digital Darwinism: The Six Stages of Digital Transformation","link":"the-race-against-digital-darwinism-the-six-stages-of-digital-transformation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/briansolis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brian Solis </a>  | <a href=\"http://www.briansolis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  BrianSolis.com </a></p><p> We live in a time of digital Darwinism, an era when technology and its impact on business and society are constant with varying, but inevitable, degrees of both evolution and revolution. The effect of digital Darwinism is real and it&rsquo;s enlivened though changes in people (your customers, employees and partners) and how markets are advancing as a result. To thrive in these times, many companies are investing in digital transformation to drive business evolution and modernization. In fact, all the big research firms and consultancies from Deloitte to Accenture to CapGemini and also my team at Altimeter Group are dedicating significant resources to study how companies are changing because of digital. </p><p> For all of its exposure (or over exposure), digital transformation is relatively young and still developing with much still to understand. For example, in my previous research, I found that most companies claim to be undergoing digital transformation (88%) but only 25% were doing so with purpose beyond investing in new technology as a means to modernize technology infrastructures. What became clear over the years is that many of the executives who are driving change did so from a technology-first perspective when in fact, this work represents so much more.</p><p> Digital transformation is one of those terms that means different things to different people. After studying the space and talking to those leading change, I sought to capture a definition based on what I heard time and time again. The working definition for digital transformation I ended up with was this&hellip;</p><p> Digital transformation as the realignment of, or new investment in technology, business models, and processes to create new value for customers and employees and more effectively compete in an ever- changing digital economy.</p><p> What started as enterprise initiatives led by progressive CIOs and IT organizations has spread throughout every facet of business. Now, executives in other critical functions are also leading investments to bring their own technology roadmaps to life. In some cases, there&rsquo;s internal competition between groups. For example, CMOs are often cited as the rival to CIOs in spending when it comes to new technologies and resources. But over time, all facets of business must work together under a common vision and aspiration if it is to excel in an era of digital Darwinism. This, I&rsquo;ve learned, is something that happens only after departments attempt change independently. Eventually, there&rsquo;s momentum and support to drive collaboration across the enterprise.</p><h3> <strong>  How is it that companies start working as one entity?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Time and time again, it comes down to how people are changing as customers and employees, how their relationship with technology impacts behavior and ultimately how companies, in addition to drive profitability, continually invest in new and emerging tech to remove friction, create new value and scale. This is just the beginning of the digital transformation story. As part of my latest research study, I learned that change plays out in a series of common phases that span several key areas of most organizations.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/six-stages.png\" width=\"669\"/></p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Introducing a Maturity Model To Guide Your Digital Transformation </strong></h3><p> <br/> Over the last three years, I&rsquo;ve studied the maturity paths of some of the world&rsquo;s leading brands including Dell, Discover, GM, Harvard, Lego, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Nestl&eacute;, Novartis, Sephora, Starbucks, Target, among many others. The result is a new report, &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www2.prophet.com/sixstagesofdigitaltransformation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Race Against Digital Darwinism: Six Stages of Digital Transformation </a> .&rdquo; It introduces a maturity framework that documents how companies are advancing technology roadmaps, business models and processes to compete in the digital economy.</p><p> This model was developed to help CIOs, CMOs, CDOs, and key stakeholders follow the paths of other successful companies. But more so, it&rsquo;s meant to give a checklist of sorts to guide, justify, validate, and effectively make the case for driving transformation. </p><p> One of the key insights I learned in the process was that mature companies establish purpose to create the kind of holistic alignment that inspires and drives enterprise-wide change. I consistently found that customer experience (CX) often served as a primary catalyst for driving change with CMOs and CIOs helping them come together to jointly lead common efforts.</p><p> Through the lens of customer experience, digital transformation, I learned, organizations evolved through six progressive stages&hellip;</p><li> <strong>  Business as Usual: </strong>  Organizations operate with a familiar legacy perspective of customers, processes, metrics, business models, and technology, believing that it remains the solution to digital relevance.</li><li> <strong>  Present and Active: </strong>  Pockets of experimentation are driving digital literacy and creativity, albeit disparately, throughout the organization while aiming to improve and amplify specific touchpoints and processes.</li><li> <strong>  Formalized: </strong>  Experimentation becomes intentional while executing at more promising and capable levels. Initiatives become bolder, and, as a result, change agents seek executive support for new resources and technology.</li><li> <strong>  Strategic: </strong>  Individual groups recognize the strength in collaboration as their research, work, and shared insights contribute to new strategic roadmaps that plan for digital transformation ownership, efforts, and investments.</li><li> <strong>  Converged: </strong>  A dedicated digital transformation team forms to guide strategy and operations based on business and customer- centric goals. The new infrastructure of the organization takes shape as roles, expertise, models, processes, and systems to support transformation are solidified.</li><li> <strong>  Innovative and Adaptive: </strong>  Digital transformation becomes a way of business as executives and strategists recognize that change is constant. A new ecosystem is established to identify and act upon technology and market trends in pilot and, eventually, at scale. <br/>  </li><p> Technology has empowered consumers to become more mobile, social, and connected than ever. This has changed how they interact with each other and with products, services, and businesses. Digital transformation opens the door to new opportunities for innovation in how to design, integrate, and manage customer (and employee) experiences.</p><p> By following a digital transformation model, all aspects of business evolve, including management perspectives, roles and responsibilities, operations, work, and, ultimately, culture.</p><p> The Six Stages of Digital Transformation represents a journey to evolve with and push ahead of technology and market trends. This is true business transformation. It&rsquo;s in the ongoing pursuit that makes change less about resolute stages and more about an evolving vision, purpose, and resolve to engage a connected generation of customers and employees. It is the collective efforts of individuals and groups and the collaboration of cross-functional roles that pave the way for a new era of business, work, and customer centricity.</p><p> Please download the  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/DT6stages\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  report here </a> .</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-26 12:13:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-26 12:13:29.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_7ZBzt1V.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-race-against-digital-darwinism-the-six-stages-of-digital-transformation/\", \"post_id\": \"12043\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-26 12:13:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-26 12:13:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-race-against-digital-darwinism-the-six-stages-of-digital-transformation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12041\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5850\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Race-Against-Digital-Darwinism-The-Six-Stages-of-Digital-Transformation.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1178\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467021600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s your guide, your foundation and the meaning behind your money, which after all is simply a tool to get what you most value.</h3><p> <br/> Even if you&rsquo;ve never bothered to formally write it down, you DO have a money code. And it&rsquo;s guiding every money decision you make.</p><p> It shows up when you decide to save 80% of your salary boost. Or teach your kids how to save their allowance.</p><p> And it also appears when you get caught in the frenzy of trying to &ldquo;keep up&rdquo; and you soothe your frustrated and over-stressed self with a little retail therapy. You point, you click, you get your package, go on your vacation, etc. And you&rsquo;re quite happy until the bill arrives.  Which sets off yet another round of &ldquo;therapy&rdquo; and bills you simply can&rsquo;t afford.</p><h3> When you arrive at the place where you can&rsquo;t tolerate this insanity&mdash;this money misery&mdash;for one more second, you&rsquo;re ready to reconstruct your code.</h3><p> <br/> It would be simple if we were computers and all we needed was to install new software to change the program, but alas, we are human and altering our beliefs, behaviors and habits takes a bit more work.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s start with the right word: shift. You want to make small shifts to live a life centered on what&rsquo;s most important to you. This includes shifting your money mindset from its current ill-functioning array of beliefs to something that really works to support a rich, full life.</p><p> Shifting beliefs, behaviors and habits requires deep thought and a rock-hard commitment that the results will be well worth your efforts (and yes, this is exactly why I wrote my newest book &ldquo;The Feel Rich Project&rdquo;.</p><p> Imagine a life where &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; is not the centerpiece of your thinking. Where worry, blame, shame and misery are erased from your experience. Where money is a tool for security and peace of mind. Sounds good, right? Well it IS good and guess what? You deserve to let your past money beliefs swirl down the drain.</p><p> But to truly eject those beliefs, you need to replace them with something else that supports your new and improved money life: we&rsquo;re talking a money code. After all, there are codes of ethics, codes of the west, codes of chivalry&mdash;even Hammurabi had a code. You can and should create your own to live by.</p><p> Think of it as a series of statements on how you&rsquo;ll devote your energies.</p><p> For example:</p><p> I will strive to live, act, spend and save consistently with my values, which includes paying myself first.  </p><p> I will measure my progress based only on my own values.  </p><p> I will continue to learn more about financial matters that impact my family and me.  </p><p> I will honor the agreements I make with myself and others.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll want to get clear on your values&mdash;what matters most to you&mdash;so that your money code can incorporate them specifically and support the shifts you are making to improve your life.</p><p> Rewiring your brain is a process because those earlier money lessons that you learned remain in place. Since you can&rsquo;t unremember them, you&rsquo;ll need to build your new code by acquiring the skills and creating the beliefs that will support you as you evolve.</p><p> Your money code becomes your guide to the way you want to live your financial life. If you&rsquo;re tired and worn out from your old code, maybe this is the right time to start reconstructing it.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-26 12:18:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-26 12:18:13.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_czMqnWJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/your-money-code-does-it-need-to-be-reconstructed/\", \"post_id\": \"12045\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-26 12:18:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-26 12:18:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"your-money-code-does-it-need-to-be-reconstructed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12044\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5851\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Your-Money-Code-Does-It-Need-to-Be-Reconstructed.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"687\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467039600,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5622,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want Digital Success? Invest in People!","link":"want-digital-success-invest-in-people","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Automation has arrived in wealth management. However, as asserted by Accenture in its recent report, <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-technology-trends-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Technology Trends 2016 </a> , the only way to take advantage of the benefits offered by digital technology and <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/feature/business-process-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  workflow automation </a>  is to invest in people.</p><p> In particular, there&rsquo;s one section of the report called &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-intelligent-automation-technology\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Intelligent Automation </a> ,&rdquo; a conglomeration of the same sort of big data/artificial intelligence/Internet of Things/algorithms trends that all the other analyst firms are focusing on. The company also surveyed more than 3,100 IT and business executives to determine their interest in this trend.</p><p> For example, 82 percent of executives surveyed agreed that organizations were being increasingly pressed to reinvent themselves and evolve their business before they are disrupted, Accenture writes.</p><p> In particular, one of the compelling arguments in the report is that intelligent workflow automation has become a key enabler of the changes companies need to make. 70 percent of corporate executives reported they were making more investments in AI-related technologies than they were two years ago. In fact, 55 percent said that they plan on using machine learning and embedded AI solutions extensively.</p><p> Much of the recent emphasis on AI has been in the context of people concerned that they will be replaced by robots or software. But lest you worry that you will intelligently automate yourself and your staff out of a job, Accenture says that&rsquo;s not the case: All this workflow automation is intended to put &ldquo;people first.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, instead of replacing people, it is intended to augment people by doing the repetitive, boring, or unpleasant tasks that the people themselves would just as soon not do. &ldquo;Far from killing jobs and creating a dehumanized future, pioneering companies are using intelligent automation to drive a new&mdash;and much more productive&mdash;relationship between people and machines,&rdquo; Accenture writes.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Instead, the people&rsquo;s jobs will switch to teaching, managing, and maintaining the machines that are doing these tasks, Accenture writes.  For example, while Siemens has implemented a &ldquo;lights out&rdquo; manufacturing plant that is completely machine-operated, it still requires 1,150 employees to support it, the company notes. &ldquo;They just have different roles than before, as many are now focused on programming, monitoring, and machine maintenance.&rdquo;</p><p> Where all these people are going to come from, when  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/4-reasons-youre-having-trouble-hiring-techies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  we can&rsquo;t find data scientists and other skilled technologists </a>  now, Accenture doesn&rsquo;t say.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> On the other hand, Accenture provides intelligent workflow automation plans that companies can implement over the course of 100 to 365 days, including some of the following recommendations:</p><li> <strong>  Take an inventory of labor-intensive business processes </strong>  and identify appropriate opportunities to invest in automation. For wealth management, firms can think of ways to automate document naming, filing and routing for approval. These can help to improve operational capabilities and scale analytics.</li><li> <strong>  Map these examples/use cases against your current business processes </strong>  and corporate strategy to prioritize specific opportunities&mdash;to catch up or gain new advantages.</li><li> <strong>  Map the implications of tasks being automated </strong> &mdash;the changes to roles, organization, processes and skills. Determine what needs to be done fundamentally differently once certain automated tasks are removed from the human side of the workforce. <br/>  </li><p> What Accenture is describing is essentially to &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/creating-workflow-think-garden/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Create a workflow </a> &rdquo; by looking at:</p><li> How do users generate content?</li><li> Where is the information from that content being recorded?</li><li> What is the point of the content?</li><li> Is the information source used again? <br/>  </li><p> And remember that once you&rsquo;ve created the workflow, you can use workflow management software to keep it running smoothly. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be used only for high-end processes such as self-learning. Documents can be automated, too.</p><p> Following these methods to define the steps of a process, and then look for ways to streamline it, can&rsquo;t help but improve how your firm functions. This is true even if all the steps continue to be performed by people and your firm never implements intelligent automation  per se.  And you can switch over that much more quickly, when AI tools become available.</p><h3> Or when your robotic overlords tell you to&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Get more information on the top trends affecting today&rsquo;s workplace &ndash; including cloud, mobility and workflow automation &ndash; in  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/resource/idc-report-top-5-trends-in-ecm/?utm_source=text&amp;utm_medium=simplicityblog&amp;utm_campaign=accenture_digital_automation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this exclusive IDC research </a> , &ldquo;The Future of ECM: Code-Free Integrations and Anywhere Access.&rdquo;</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-26 12:20:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-26 12:20:21.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_QSGKVAh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-digital-success-invest-in-people/\", \"post_id\": \"12047\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-26 12:20:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-26 12:20:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-digital-success-invest-in-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12046\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5852\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Want-Digital-Success-Invest-in-People.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1167\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467050400,"author_id":308,"chart_url":""}

Commissioned by Jefferson National and conducted online by Harris Poll in March 2016, Advisor Authority is a comprehensive study that reflects the viewpoints of more than 680 RIAs and fee-based advisors and more than 700 individual investors nationwide.</p><h3> <strong>  Advisor Outlook </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Volatility remains advisors&rsquo; number one concern when it comes to investing, protecting clients&rsquo; portfolios and protecting their own practice.</h3><p> <br/> RIAs and fee-based advisors say volatility will have an adverse impact across the board&mdash;and more than three fourths expect it to rise. Yet, roughly two thirds of RIAs and fee-based advisors still say their outlook for 2016 is optimistic&mdash;and more than three fourths expect the profitability of their practice to increase.</p><h3> Nearly two thirds of advisors feel pressure to revise their investing strategy in this volatile market.</h3><p> <br/> More than two thirds say they will invest more conservatively, and three fourths say they will invest more tactically. The most successful advisors are even more likely to invest tactically.</p><h3> Optimistic about their practice, advisors&rsquo; top priority is the pursuit of profitability&mdash;and the push for new clients remains the top driver.</h3><p> <br/> And, like last year, advisors continue to target an &ldquo;Emerging Market&rdquo; of new clients to drive growth and profits. The most successful advisors are a step ahead, targeting an even younger generation, far more focused on retaining clients&rsquo; heirs and investing in innovative marketing to build a durable franchise for the future.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Transparency matters.</h3><p> <br/> More than two thirds of advisors address fees with their clients, and will not make an investment unless they can effectively communicate the strategy to clients&mdash;or know their clients understand it. Nearly two thirds address the impact of taxes in some way. RIAs and fee-based advisors are more likely to take a &ldquo;High-Touch&rdquo; approach, focused on building relationships and frequent communication, versus a &ldquo;Low-Touch&rdquo; approach.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Investor Outlook </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Investors say protecting assets, healthcare costs, saving for retirement and taxes are top financial concerns&mdash;and taxes rise in importance for the most affluent.</h3><p> <br/> Investors focus less on managing the market&mdash;and focus more on striking a balance between their plans for the future and today&rsquo;s bottom line. This creates even more pressure for advisors to stay focused on managing the market and the big picture.</p><h3> Investors say volatility is rising&mdash;yet most are uncertain about changing their investing strategy in response.</h3><p> <br/> While volatility is not their top financial concern, investors overall understand it can have an impact on portfolio performance.

Yet, almost half of investors who have an advisor say they are optimistic, compared to roughly one third of investors who do not.</p><h3> Investors value experience, a holistic approach and a fee-based fiduciary standard most.</h3><p> <br/> As markets grow increasingly volatile and the world becomes increasingly complex, investors seek an experienced advisor who can provide holistic and personalized service&mdash;and one who will put their best interests first.

{"original_id":5624,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Navigating the Stages of Love","link":"navigating-the-stages-of-love","source_link":null,"content":"<p> What are the key ingredients to a successful and long lasting relationship? Effort, intention, attention, and looking at the long game. And humor! LOTS of humor! Couples that share an openness and willingness to traverse through the stages of love, despite the inherent ups and downs, will find themselves on the other side if they can weather the storms that often arise, even if it doesn't feel that way in the moment.</p><h3> <strong>  The Romantic Stage.   </strong></h3><p> <br/> Feelings of bliss and happiness are universal and magnified with new relationships during this stage of love. Think where have you been all my life! Your world is wonderful. Differences are viewed as strengths. There is a great emphasis on similarities and sameness. We are fixated on this other person often to the exclusion of other things and people. We are obsessed. You forget about your limitations, fears, and inhibitions. You feel whole, connected, and loved!  But, it&rsquo;s easy to neglect other relationships and have intense focus on your new partner. Tread carefully because an overly enmeshed relationship prevents maintenance of your  own  identity. For some it can lead to codependency.</p><p> As time marches on, a shift in the relationship occurs. After months of going full speed at 80 mph, there is a shift. The effect of the &lsquo;feel good&rsquo; neurotransmitter, Dopamine, has worn off and you find yourself less high on love. Reality sets in. Hello, power struggles!</p><h3> <strong>  Power Struggle Stage. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> The rose-colored glasses have become a little less 'rosy.&rsquo; The illusion that romantic love will last forever is often replaced with disappointment. A shift occurs from your similarities to differences. Behaviors that were once cute have become annoyances. People attempt to change their partner back to what they thought they were or what they created in their mind. Arguments and disagreements increase. Miscommunication occurs due to different communication styles. Many relationships cannot weather the storms.</p><p> Each clash or power struggle makes you feel a little less hopeful about your future together and affects your sense of security in the relationship. This makes you feel more out of balance. Whereas once is felt good to be together, there is now uncertainty about what to expect from your partner. If couples are not careful, they can resort to punitive tactics such as guilt, shame, and fear - in their attempt to get their attention. Couples also blame the other for the relationship demise and want them to change.</p><h3> <strong>  During this process, work towards these things to prevent the relationship ending: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Accepting and appreciating your differences</li><li> Learning to share power</li><li> Relinquishing your fantasies of constant harmony</li><li> Recognizing the strengths of your relationship.</li><li> Setting and reinforcing clear boundaries and demonstrating mutual respect. <br/>  </li><p> The goal of this stage is to establish your autonomy without destroying your love connection. Relationships gain strength if each person is able to manages their own feelings, handle disagreements amicably, and is open to improving and changing - if necessary - their communication styles.</p><p> This stage provides an opportunity for each person to dig a little deeper and discover what&rsquo;s important to you and find ways to challenge yourself to continue to give in ways that further strengthen your relationship. When resolved in healthy ways, the conflicts that relationships endure help strengthen your emotional intimacy with each other.</p><p> The relationship becomes more realistic, rather than an idealized &ldquo;fantasy.&rdquo;</p><p>  ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  The Stability Stage. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> During this stage, there is a greater awareness of each other&rsquo;s behaviors, differences, and annoyances. Both have worked through establishing roles and independence and have moved away from the power struggles that once monopolized the relationship. Disagreements are just that &ndash; disagreements. They do not necessarily turn into arguments but if they do, they are manageable.</p><p> A relationship rhythm has developed and each person experiences a greater feeling of relaxation. There is trust and safety allowing each person to move away from the relationship in healthy ways without the relationship feeling threatened. However, despite the positivity in the relationship, boredom lurks around the corner. This can lead to apathy or infidelity. Some people start to move away from rather than towards their partner. They might begin to &lsquo;lean out&rsquo; of the relationship. Couples start to take one another for granted. There is less attention, intention, and investment in the relationship.</p><h3> <strong>  The Commitment Stage.   </strong></h3><p> <br/> Clear choices about yourself and your partner are made. You have recognized both your and your partner&rsquo;s shortcomings and accepted them. You have been able to manage the bad times and embrace the good times. Despite the bad, you can rise above and still enjoy the other&rsquo;s company. You don&rsquo;t need the person; rather, you choose to be with this person. There is a balance between power, freedom, love, and belonging.</p><p> Some questions people ask include: Can you see yourself with this person long term? Do you have shared interests and goals? Does this person add, not take away, from your life? Is this person the total package? Do you work as a team?</p><p> These questions are reminders that relationships always need continued work, attention, and commitment.</p><h3> <strong>  Key points in love to embrace: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Communication is key. How will you communicate about your differences? How will they be managed? Can you talk about your differences in a way that encourages healthy communication strategies and understanding? In a way that honors both your similarities and differences?</li><li> Learning to recognize and embrace the stages of love can help both individuals and couples better navigate the expected twists and turns of a relationship.</li><li> Understand and prepare for the challenges that relationships bring. This helps the couple identify the triggers and be proactive rather than reactive. Learn how to work through them. This helps create the bridge that connects, not the bridge that divides</li><li> Navigating through the stages of love is not a linear process. Recognize that life is a series of transitions that can offset the calm and put the couple back in the power struggle stage. That&rsquo;s ok.</li><li> If you feel the relationship is taking a negative direction, before its too late, consult with a professional. Having a third party to help you navigate your relationship challenges could be the key to saving your relationship!</li><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-26 12:41:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-26 12:41:17.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_nAM42Xe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/navigating-the-stages-of-love/\", \"post_id\": \"12051\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-26 12:41:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-26 12:41:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"navigating-the-stages-of-love\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12050\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5854\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Navigating-the-Stages-of-Love.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1428\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467054000,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5626,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Deal with Narcissism in the Workplace","link":"how-to-deal-with-narcissism-in-the-workplace","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Narcissism. We see narcissists everywhere&mdash;in politics, in our friend groups and often even at work.</h3><p> <br/> Dealing with these types of <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2014/03/4-types-difficult-people-deal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  difficult individuals </a> can be a real challenge, especially when the workplace calls for utmost professionalism and collaboration. What do you do if you have a narcissistic colleague or even worse, a narcissistic boss?</p><p> I want to help:</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Naz1MKbSZWA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/vve.png\" width=\"842\"/> </a> <br/> click to view</p><h3> <strong>  1. The Narcissism Creativity Trap </strong></h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s something interesting: When we first meet a narcissist, we have a tendency to think of them as more creative or deserving of their egocentric ways. This is wrong.</p><p> Narcissists are not actually more creative, but their <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2014/04/5-science-based-steps-super-charge-charisma/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  charisma </a> is what often convinces us that their ideas are in fact better. Cornell University proved this with a cleverly designed study that had students come into a lab and fill out a questionnaire to gauge each participant&rsquo;s level of narcissism like &ldquo;How much do you enjoy being the center of attention?&rdquo;</p><p> The researchers then asked the participants to form pairs and pitch a movie idea to their partner. The fascinating part? When participants knew the narcissistic rating of their partner, they rated their ideas as more creative. However, when independent evaluators reviewed the same pitches, the narcissistic ideas were not rated as more creative.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Get it in Writing </strong></h3><p> <br/> Narcissists are typically loud and proud in the workplace, meaning your ideas and opinions can get lost in the shuffle. If possible, get ideas in writing before ever discussing them aloud. You could recommend your team submit projects thoughts and goals via email and then discuss these topics in a meeting. This way, everyone feels like they are heard and valued.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  3. Two Narcissists May Be Better than One </strong></h3><p> <br/> I know this may be hard to believe, but stay with me. Remember the Cornell University study with the movie pitches? These same researchers followed-up their original study with a new experimental twist. They had 292 participants split into groups and asked each group to come up with a few creative ways for a company to improve its performance. Amazingly, the groups with two narcissists came up with better and more attainable goals and ideas than the groups with only one or no narcissists. Why?</p><p> Egomania is contagious meaning that the creative fury of one narcissist can spark the competitive nature of another narcissist, fueling the overall creative process. However, when there were more than 2 narcissists in a group, the competitiveness undermined the group&rsquo;s effectiveness as a whole.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Leverage Your Narcissists </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you got it, flaunt in! If you&rsquo;re stuck working with a narcissist, chances are there&rsquo;s not much you can do to change their personality. But, you can leverage their high confidence and charisma&mdash;use them when you need to pitch ideas, make sales, confirm leads or sell products. Even if they are a little self-centered, their bountiful energy and enthusiasm can be infectious with groups and clients.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Don&rsquo;t be Fooled </strong></h3><p> <br/> Bottom line. Identity the egoists in your workplace and be hyper aware of their ideas and opinions. Do not let their confidence and charisma trick you into thinking that their ideas are always right.</p><p> You have a voice too. Make it heard. You are confident, intelligent and charismatic. Make it known.</p><p> Want to learn more about how to connect with colleagues, clients and build your business?

And yet, it&rsquo;s clear that the Brexit doesn&rsquo;t have the widespread significance of the 2008 financial crisis&mdash;a fortunate fact for those of us in the US.</p><p> Sadly, it&rsquo;s unlikely the UK will fare as well. Voters in the UK chose to believe the words of  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson\" target=\"_blank\">  Boris Johnson </a> , the populist leader of the &ldquo;leave&rdquo; movement and the presumptive next Prime Minister now that  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron\" target=\"_blank\">  David Cameron </a>  has stepped down. The people were swayed by Johnson&rsquo;s claims that leaving the EU would result in both control of the Britain&rsquo;s borders (to reduce immigration)  and  greater prosperity. I think he was wrong. Britain needs the EU in order to continue being a successful economy. But economic benefits came with EU policies that repulsed many Brits. Frustration and rage were a loud voice in this vote, and the consequences may not be what the &ldquo;leave&rdquo; voters had in mind. Here&rsquo;s what I think the Brexit vote will really mean to Britain:</p><li> A recession . How deep and how long? Only time will tell.</li><li> A drop in currency value , especially against the US dollar. The pound has already dropped 8%, and that number could grow.</li><li> A shrinking economy . And we&rsquo;ll see the usual fallout: fewer jobs, greater unemployment, and falling hom <br/>  </li><p> For those of us on this side of &ldquo;the pond,&rdquo; Britain&rsquo;s storm should deliver much smaller waves to our shores. Here&rsquo;s what we might expect:</p><li> Interest rates will remain at historic lows . Janet Yellen and the Fed have taken a rate hike off the table until further notice.</li><li> A US recession is unlikely . US earnings are solid, employment is up, and there are no indicators of a pending slide. As long as US consumers continue to gain confidence, this should not change.</li><li> Slower growth  is likely due to the stronger dollar. <br/>  </li><p> Luckily, the US is not as vulnerable to the Brexit as other countries. Unlike the mostly EU countries that are Britain&rsquo;s most active trading partners, only 13.4% of our economy is made up of exports. Compare that to Germany whose trade is a whopping 50%. Our economy is highly insulated from Europe and much of the rest of the world. Rising incomes and a rising economy are still in place here.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If your stocks are 50% or less of your portfolio, you should be fine over the long term. But we&rsquo;ll probably see more volatility for some time as markets adjust values. If you are only invested in US-based companies who are indirectly exposed to Europe by doing business there, then your position is even stronger.</p><p> This is nothing like 2008. But if the situation begins to mirror last February, we could see a larger drop before things turn around. The Dow dropped 12.5% then and fully recovered by the end of the quarter on March 31. Today we saw a mere 3.39% drop, so the ride could get rougher. If you&rsquo;re seeking advice on how to ride it out, know that we placed 50 &ldquo;buys&rdquo; today for stock funds and ETFs to take advantage of today&rsquo;s &ldquo;sale&rdquo; on stocks. I have full faith we&rsquo;ll be glad we did.</p><p> Remember, this too shall pass. Hang in there, focus on living your life, and know that if the riding gets too rough to handle, we&rsquo;re here to answer your questions and address your concerns.    </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-26 13:34:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-26 13:34:09.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_hj8xAiL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/britains-brexit-its-time-to-ride-out-the-storm/\", \"post_id\": \"12058\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-26 13:34:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-26 13:34:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"britains-brexit-its-time-to-ride-out-the-storm\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12057\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5857\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Britains-Brexit-Its-Time-to-Ride-out-the-Storm.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"786\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467025200,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}

They&rsquo;ve put their experience into words, so you can put your words and ideas into action.</p><h3> 1) Know Your Stuff (we mean sales and marketing)</h3><p> <br/> <i>  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to think your product is amazing. That everyone who hears about it would be crazy not to take it off your hands at twice the price. The opposite is true. You will serve yourself and your business well to get good at sales and marketing.&rdquo; </i></p><li> Rob Walling for  <a href=\"https://www.getdrip.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Drip </a> <br/>  </li><h3> 2) IT ISN&rsquo;T EASY</h3><p> <br/> <i>  &ldquo;Starting a business is rarely easy, and almost always more difficult than one can imagine. The odds are against you&mdash;the rate of failure is high, and the threat of bankruptcy looms before you&mdash;but you must summon the will to lead; you must have the ability to see what others cannot envision, which is the one thing few may ever achieve: Success.&rdquo;   </i></p><li> Brad Cummins for  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Local Life Agents </a> <br/>  </li><h3> 3) ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ON YOU</h3><p> <br/> <i>  &ldquo;One of the things nobody tells you before becoming an entrepreneur is that in the beginning you&rsquo;ll probably be working a lot more hours for a lot less pay; and sometimes owning your own business is going to feel a lot like a job&hellip; only harder because you only have yourself to be held accountable to.&rdquo; </i></p><li> Anonymous <br/>  </li><h3> 4) RESPONSIBILITY REAPS REWARD</h3><p> <br/> <i>  &ldquo;I wish I would have known how much fun and liberating being my own employer is!

{"original_id":5629,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Ask Brilliant Questions To Make Smart Decisions","link":"how-to-ask-brilliant-questions-to-make-smart-decisions","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Have you ever wondered  if I would have only known then what I know now ? It makes no difference who you are, this has happened to you. It&rsquo;s happened to me. No one escapes this feeling at some point.</p><p> Sometimes, the choices you made resulted in little owies. Other times, I&rsquo;m sure it was much more painful.</p><p> Regardless, any time you&rsquo;ve made a poor decision, at least one of two things was wrong. You either had a faulty decision-making process or you didn&rsquo;t have accurate or complete information.</p><p> Even if you have the world&rsquo;s greatest decision-making process, nothing other than pure luck can overcome a lack of information when making your decisions. Sure, you can blindly get lucky, but I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to take that chance.</p><p> Today, I&rsquo;d like to talk about how to ask brilliant questions to make smart decisions. The techniques I&rsquo;ll run over can apply to anything in your life, but I&rsquo;m going to concentrate on the business world, especially as it relates to job interviews and making sound career decisions.</p><p> All good things come in threes.</p><p> Anytime you&rsquo;re asking questions in a job interview or questioning someone as it relates to business, you can prepare yourself by first asking three questions:</p><li> What do I want to know and why is it important to me?</li><li> How will I ask it?</li><li> How and when will I use the information? <br/>  </li><p> As it relates to these three questions, what I&rsquo;ve noticed is that most people (for whatever reason) spend way too little time on the first question of what they want to know and virtually no time on why they want to know it.</p><p> They spend even less time determining exactly how they&rsquo;ll ask the questions. And, very few consider the strategy of when they&rsquo;ll use the information. That&rsquo;s when&mdash;as in a specific moment in time&mdash;they&rsquo;ll use the information to their advantage.</p><p> Not to stray from our focus today, but I&rsquo;ve written several articles about the many great benefits you can realize from asking questions. I&rsquo;ve included some show notes to articles you can check out to see how to sell yourself, show your organizational skills, and demonstrate passion and interest. Of course, you can always  <a href=\"https://www.milewalkacademy.com/store/e3rxvqLg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  grab   Interview Intervention </a> , which has loads of insight on these topics.</p><p> But, I want to focus primarily on how to ask your questions to gather information to make great decisions (perhaps career decisions).</p><h3> <strong>  First Question: What do I want to know and why do I want to know it? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Now, the first question to ask is, &ldquo;What do I want to know and why do I want to know it?&rdquo;</p><p> You must know what information you need to gather and why it&rsquo;s important to you. When you&rsquo;re evaluating a job change, the best place to start is your requirements. I spent considerable time in an earlier podcast titled  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/first-thing-want-change-careers-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The First Thing To Do When You Want To Change Careers </a>  speaking about your &ldquo;whys.&rdquo;</p><p> Your whys are such great places to start because that&rsquo;s what you care about! Why would start in any other place?</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Second Question: How will I ask it? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Before I get to how to structure your questions and those other benefits, there&rsquo;s something really important to understand.</p><p> Your goal in a time compressed situation such as a job interview or a business meeting is to gather as much accurate information in the least amount of time. You do not want to run the risk of wasting time or getting insight that, while nice to know, isn&rsquo;t necessary for you to make the best decision for you or your company.</p><p> If you ask a poorly designed question, you not only run the risk wasting time but also not getting the information you need. There&rsquo;s also a domino effect because you&rsquo;ve now burned up time you needed to ask additional questions.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s why. When two people are speaking, in any situation, you have biases that were formed from your life experiences. These biases cause you to interpret words and gestures in a particular manner. There are natural communication gaps. There are distractions. All of these issues make it difficult for you to accurately exchange your message with another. Without diving too deeply into this commotion, realize these issues are present.</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure you can think of many situations where you&rsquo;re speaking to another. You thought you said something clearly, but the other person misunderstood you. This isn&rsquo;t much of a stretch.</p><p> When you ask job interview questions, you could put the interviewer at risk of not providing the information you need if you ask a poorly designed question.</p><p> I consider a poorly designed question to any question that leaves interpretation for why you want to know what you want to know.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s an example: Let&rsquo;s review two job candidates to illustrate the point.</p><p> The first candidate, a senior executive, is interviewing with a human resources executive for a technology consulting firm.</p><p> The second candidate is a professional services software developer interviewing with the same HR executive. Both decide to ask the same question, but for two entirely different reasons:</p><p> &ldquo;Can you please describe your client portfolio?&rdquo;</p><p> The senior executive is interested in whether there is sufficient balance between industries and clients to ensure the company remains healthy in the event a significant client leaves or there is an economic downturn in one of the industry sectors.</p><p> The software developer wants to understand the different types of clients and their locations because she is interested in understanding which sectors she&rsquo;ll be supporting and where she will likely travel.</p><p> How will the interviewer know how to answer the question?</p><p> Rarely will the interviewer clarify the question with a response such as, &ldquo;Why is that important to you?&rdquo;</p><p> Most people will make an assumption regarding why you want to know. Their assumption will default to why  they  would want to know that information.</p><p> More often, she will simply start speaking and provide superfluous information you find unimportant for your needs or decision process. Consequently, you waste time.</p><p> Instead, I&rsquo;d encourage you to position the interviewer in advance to narrow her response so she can address your most pertinent needs. For example:</p><p> Senior Executive : &ldquo;Can you please describe your client portfolio? I&rsquo;m interested in understanding your current distribution because I want to ensure the organization is financially balanced and stable in the event we lose a client or there is a sector downturn.</p><p> Software Developer : &ldquo;Can you please describe your client portfolio? The reason this information is important to me is that I want to understand the types of companies I would consult for because I have more experience implementing solutions in some sectors than others. That will also provide me with a sense of where I&rsquo;m likely to travel.&rdquo;</p><p> Adding your rationale at the end is the key to getting the insight you want as quickly as you can possibly get it. The sooner you get the information you need, the more time you create to ask additional questions.</p><p> [I mentioned  Interview Intervention  earlier. In the book, I spend a lot of time breaking down all the benefits you can gain from asking well-structured questions. It&rsquo;s my belief you can optimize your questions so you are selling yourself and also gathering the insight you need. So check out the book.

One of your goals is to sell yourself and another is to gather insight to make a good career decision. That means, some information you gather during the session needs to be used immediately and some can be contemplated.</p><p> I call this short-term and long-term use of the information.</p><p> Any question you ask that yields information you can immediately use to sell yourself or make a decision is short-term.</p><p> Any question you ask that yields information you&rsquo;ll ponder is long-term.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a look at a few examples:</p><p> Short-Term/Role-Related : &ldquo;I was wondering whether you could share what you consider the qualities and characteristics of the most successful individuals on the team I&rsquo;d be joining. The reason I&rsquo;d like to understand this is to ensure that I would fit well with my potential teammates.&rdquo;</p><p> The interviewer will now highlight those characteristics for the candidate. You, in turn, can make notations of these qualities, which are essentially what the company wants to duplicate and hire.

{"original_id":5630,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Financial Services PR in the New World Order - Turbocharge your PR","link":"financial-services-pr-in-the-new-world-order-turbocharge-your-pr","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/author/katy-lithgow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Katy Lithgow </a> Over the past two weeks we've looked at the changing nature of media and how it's affecting financial services PR. While journalists cut backs and diminishing newsroom resources have made  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/financial-services-pr-in-the-new-world-order-and-why-you-need-to-care-part-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  some elements of communications harder </a>  (as explained in part 1 of our series), the digital media take-over has also brought brands new opportunities to  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/financial-services-pr-meeting-disruption-head-on-part-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  optimise public relations plans </a>  (as explained in part 2 of our series) that never existed before.In this final instalment in our series, we take you beyond strengthening your existing media relations strategy and show you creative ways to turbocharge your PR for stellar results.</p><h3> <strong>  1. The rise and rise of social and amplification  </strong></h3>A few years ago, front page coverage in the Australian Financial Review could cause your website to crash. These days it's rare for any press coverage to achieve that level of organic response so you need to know how to leverage what you've got.So take that front page coverage, enjoy it for a moment, then think about how you're going to use relevant social channels to 10x your mileage. Amplification 101 includes sharing the coverage on your company's LinkedIn page, Twitter account and other relevant social platforms. You should also be looking within and outside your organisation to influencers and encouraging them to share and engage with the content by responding to comments and posting in relevant groups.Advanced amplification would see you utilising the earned media coverage for your lead generation activity and<a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/atomising-content-in-financial-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> atomising</a> it to create more content, such as infographics, listicles and white papers, effectively turning it into owned media.<h3> <strong>  2. Digital innovations  </strong></h3>Amplification will continue to grow in importance for your PR plan as new social players continue to emerge. Few of these will be the next Facebook or LinkedIn, but it&rsquo;s worth considering whether your financial services brand should be utilising any of these new channels to engage with wider audiences.Take Snapchat. Initially passed off as a Gen-Y focused messaging program that was for sharing private photos, today more and more brands and <a href=\"https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-16/abc-news-snapchat-avatar/7517532?pfm=sm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> news outlets</a> are jumping onboard with Discover, Snapchat's storytelling feature. While this is currently more a B2C channel, there is potential for brands and CEOs to get on board in the future, particularly for consumer focused pieces targeted at millenials.<img alt=\"\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/abcnews-snapchat.png\" width=\"699\"/>Video is another good demonstration of PR's technological evolution.  A few years ago, online video content and video news releases were an emerging trend. Now <a href=\"http://apo.org.au/resource/digital-news-report-australia-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> the majority of news is consumed via a screen</a>, whether traditional TV news for over 55s, or online mainly via social media for those aged 18-24.##TRENDING##Indeed, in a <a href=\"http://digitalnewsreport.org/publications/2016/predictions-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> survey</a> of 130 top Editors, CEOs and Digital Leaders, 79% said they would be investing more in online news video in 2016. And 54% said deepening online engagement was a top priority.The learning for your financial services PR plan is that you can achieve greater results with embedded video in your releases, video news releases and other content optimised for the digital space, such as infographics and multimedia capabilities.What's next? The hottest digital marketing trend of 2016 is virtual reality. So some time not too far away, you might actually be considering a virtual press release...##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> <strong>  3. Who are your influencers? </strong></h3>In addition to looking to your CEO and other employees to share and engage with your content, your supercharged PR plan should include <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/social-influence-and-your-communications-program/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> influencer outreach</a>. Why? Because the digital wave has kick-started the democratisation of information-sharing, and these people and their platforms are essentially your new media.As we previously discussed, some of these influencers are journalists who are active on social media. Others are bloggers, members of forums and social media commenters. Identifying the right influencer for your brand can make a world of difference for your reach and awareness. Start by looking at the quality of their content, alignment of values to your brand, organic reach, and your relationship with the influencers (which can be built over time).<h3> <strong>  4. Thought leadership and the return of long form content  </strong></h3>2015 may have been the year of the GIF and the soundbite, but 2016 is shaping up to be the year that longform content makes its return.As we have discussed in parts 1 and 2 of this blog series, creating original thought leadership is a key strategy to standing out. Good PR will then drive amplification of your messages and give your content strategy the ability to deliver a return on investment.Fortunately, the media's appetite for contributed articles and opinion pieces remains strong, and is even growing as newsroom resources learn to cope in the new world order.Older style platforms such as podcasts and e-newsletters also provide opportunities to promote, share and drive eyeballs to your earned coverage via your owned content channels.If you're struggling to grasp how to achieve results via content marketing, our <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=0e5d68e4-f904-45cb-b7f3-207c0207da39&amp;placement_guid=6bd017c7-9c7c-4009-bc7f-371b94bc190c&amp;portal_id=537730&amp;redirect_url=APefjpGHQxrsXL4d9rT0CFDeqis6PiD0LctHdWbVMgK8gDE8ooKP5gtPiGiJNkvO0jb2Mid9NrU8X3UZPVlwtXFPh20GJVhplwIGe3ZvJ_3bRpH_XbokQ-mhttytLjZGok1i_frN0RADr9q7dnggfBgeSo7v6d6JvVhWaTjPt1BTMZdbag7tqr1KCmJHaSJN6dQUpGjxs3gyahRcG-rvBdDRwYOQxcmETzNJ0CThx7L8hQMDFM1FM60N48Fytqzg4mJ_V2GlmKCba8C6txU_UtbcOIpmHChWXoog5PSAuT8-kV7NuiYw_3B2DdCQmfTsYTFApQoxvHip&amp;hsutk=0984622acac8706ce9cfdb298a0b2a87&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluechipcommunication.com.au%2Fblog%2Ffree-download-content-distribution-for-financial-services-playbook&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluechipcommunication.com.au%2Fblog%2Ffree-download-content-distribution-for-financial-services-playbook&amp;__hsfp=1786576594\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> content marketing playbook</a> can help.<h3> <strong>  5.  </strong> <strong>  SEO your PR  </strong></h3>In a digital-first world, you can boost your searchability by incorporating SEO techniques into your PR strategies. It may not come intuitively at first, but trust us, the results are worth it.Start by identifying your target phrase and embedding it in the press release title, subtitle, introduction and closing paragraph. Make sure that you don't sacrifice good writing for keyword stuffing which will penalise your best efforts and make it a pretty poor experience for your reader. Also consider URL links as long as they provide additional insight or value to the topic you're covering. We discussed the <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/the-unlikely-marriage-of-pr-and-seo-and-five-tips-to-make-the-match/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> unlikely marriage between PR and SEO</a> in more detail in a previous blog.So there you have it.

{"original_id":5631,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: Start With All the Possibilities When Creating a Value Proposition","link":"advisors-start-with-all-the-possibilities-when-creating-a-value-proposition","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Creating a value proposition that truly differentiates a professional and resonates with the target market audience is one of the hardest things to create, and one of the most important.</h3><p> <br/> It is THE thing which sits at the centre of all your marketing if you get it right.  It becomes embedded in tag lines or positioning statements, referral and networking conversations, marketing collateral &ndash; both physical and digital &ndash; and extends through to introductory conversations with new prospects.</p><p> Professionals can (and do!) get through an entire career without ever truly understanding what makes them different to their peers, let alone being able to express that difference succinctly.  For them, their career is one where they are continually competing on price and convenience and struggling to be valued to the extent they should be.  To break away from the competition based on price or convenience and to maximise the value that prospective clients place upon you there must be a clear point of difference which is desired.    It has to result in an outcome that the target market clients want.</p><p> When struggling to define the point of difference it is helpful to map out possible areas of differentiation, such as the ones following:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/creating-a-value-prop.png\" width=\"618\"/></p><p> This is essentially a brainstorming exercise to begin with, and there are 6 &ldquo;big&rdquo; areas provided to start the thinking. These are more strategic or thematic as beginning points.  You might for instance believe that your ability to differentiate is going to be built around how you deliver your advice, or perhaps in the post-engagement area of the ongoing experiences that clients have with you and your firm. (I have chosen these 2 as examples because they are quite different, yet often confused as being the same thing).</p><p> If you were choosing to differentiate based upon &ldquo;delivery&rdquo;, then a little bit of further thinking might suggest that price or terms that reduce barriers or beat market expectations could be a competitive point.  Equally, how you package and deliver the advice may be done quite differently to the mainstream.  Perhaps the standard or quality of the advice might be where you are best in creating a value proposition &ndash; and that quality might be deliberately higher or lower than the standard in the marketplace.  An actual example of how this type of approach works is the financial advisory firm which does not meet clients in person&hellip;.re-defining the accepted standard for delivery of advice.  I know of advice models where the advisers do not physically meet clients at all, choosing instead to engage electronically with a transactional approach, or choosing to engage electronically with a highly personalized advice process that simply minimises travel and meeting time and delivers higher levels of convenience because clients can be sitting at home in their pyjama&rsquo;s.  For these advisory firms they have created a clear and compelling value proposition by choosing to deliver advice differently.</p><p> Some firms of course choose (or are forced to choose by compliance departments!) to deliver advice precisely the same way as everybody else.  For such a firm they may form the view that their best opportunity to differentiate meaningfully for clients is to provide unparalleled client experiences.  Make the professional experience so superlative that clients are continually wowed!  Or at least sufficiently wowed that they don&rsquo;t consider ever switching to some other firm that promises to be more convenient, or perhaps have better pricing&hellip;.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If the &ldquo;client experiences&rdquo; was an area of competitive difference, there are once again a number of ways one might look build the offer.  It may be in the form of an outstanding rewards or loyalty offer&hellip;.perhaps the functions and social aspects of the ongoing service are the wow factors&hellip;..maybe it is the professional positioning and ongoing business-building opportunities that your firm can create for your clients which is the differentiator.</p><p> Ultimately what matters in creating a great value proposition is that it explains a desirable outcome that your target market wants.  Any professional can expect that  <strong>  any other </strong>  competent professional is able to compete with them based on the simple behavioural standards or generic technical knowledge &ndash; so common knowledge and common standards within the profession are&hellip;well&hellip;&rdquo;common&rdquo;.  They are not points of difference at all, let alone something upon which to build the business reputation and become the centre piece of future marketing efforts.</p><p> To define and then refine your value proposition begin by figuring out the possible thematic areas of differentiation.  Then from those figure out the different ways within each of those themes that differentiation could be pursued.  Then settle on your desired strategy.  Once that is done it is simply a matter of putting that difference into words &ndash; and then executing the strategy.</p><p> The first step in creating a value proposition which will resonate with prospects and work for you is to brainstorm and figure out the possibilities first. It really is that simple  &ndash; to begin with.  But then the hard work will start, because you have to be able to deliver and live up to the promise you made to the market.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-26 16:36:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-26 16:36:47.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_7dZp1Zh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-start-with-all-the-possibilities-when-creating-a-value-proposition/\", \"post_id\": \"12068\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-26 16:36:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-26 16:36:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-start-with-all-the-possibilities-when-creating-a-value-proposition\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12066\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5861\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Advisors-Start-With-All-the-Possibilities-When-Creating-a-Value-Proposition.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1513\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467014400,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

But do any of your content marketing efforts matter if they don&rsquo;t intentionally convert visitors into leads and leads into customers?</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced digital marketer, or just dipping your toes into the process for the first time, it&rsquo;s very likely you&rsquo;ve started to wonder about how you can help your content convert more leads. And while this is a specialized process &mdash; in fact, many copywriters and marketing firms specialize in CRO, or  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/what-is-conversion-rate-optimization-cro/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  conversion rate optimization </a>  &mdash; there are a few things you can do today to help your company write web content that converts.</p><h3> Aligning the Moving Parts of Website Content</h3><p> <br/> When we talk about content, it&rsquo;s important to note that we aren&rsquo;t simply talking about the words you use as you write your website, blog or whitepapers. We&rsquo;re talking about how your  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/create-content-marketing-blueprint/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  content marketing blueprint </a>  (the big picture plan of the content) and your  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/skip-5-types-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  content marketing assets </a>  (the format of the content) combine to create web content that converts.  It&rsquo;s putting the pieces together that matters.</p><p> Each of these moving parts is important to itself and requires thoughtful planning. And while it may seem like the content development process is a large undertaking, investing time and attention in your overall strategy leads directly to higher conversion rates.</p><h3> Approach Every Content Campaign With These Rules</h3><p> <br/> With a content marketing blueprint in place that identifies the copy titles and formats that will most resonate with your prospective customers, you can bring your focus back to developing web content that converts.</p><p> <strong>  For every asset you develop, make sure you follow the following three conversion-focused content rules: </strong></p><h3> 1. Freely share your knowledge.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Carefully controlling who can learn what about how your company functions is an outdated business practice. </strong>  While you should still protect proprietary information, just about everything else is fair game for attracting customers.</p><p> Collectively, your company has a lot of experience to share. Your people has stories to share. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to open up and share this experience with customers who are hungry for authentic connection with a prospective partner.</p><h3> 2. Target each asset to a persona.</h3><p> <br/> When you sit down to commission a blog article or white paper to support your content marketing efforts, it can be tempting to focus the project on as many people as possible in order to expand its reach.  <strong>  However, untargeted copy is bad copy, and   <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2014/06/content-for-everybody-nobody/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   targeting everyone actually ends up targeting no one  </a>  . </strong></p><p> <strong>  For every asset you develop, pretend you&rsquo;re answering a specific question asked by a specific person. </strong>  Using this focused approach for all of your copy &mdash; whether you&rsquo;re writing blog articles, white papers, case studies, or emails &mdash; will allow you to form a personal connection with each reader that your audience would otherwise opt out of.</p><p> I occasionally speak at different industry events, and like to put myself on the &ldquo;hot seat&rdquo; during Q&amp;A time. That&rsquo;s the same mindset I have during writing &mdash; to answer a direct question in hopes that others will overhear and take something away from the conversation.</p><h3> 3. Be conversational.</h3><p> <br/> Different content formats require different tones of voice. But  <strong>  don&rsquo;t make the mistake of thinking that formal is always better. </strong>  For example, consider the impact of a polished article on The Harvard Business Review compared to a new blog post from marketing thought leader Seth Godin. These two types of content couldn&rsquo;t be more different, and yet they&rsquo;re equally effective for different people in different ways.</p><p> <strong>  The web content you develop for your company doesn&rsquo;t need to be scholarly or intricately polished to be effective </strong>  (unless you&rsquo;re selling to an academician).

Understand that you are a sales person, not a portfolio manager </strong></h3><p> <br/> While the above seems obvious, given the blank stares we get when we talk about prospecting, we have come to realize that a huge hurdle for many advisors is understanding that in order to grow their business, they have to do a lot more than be great advisors or portfolio managers &ndash; they have to be great sales people. No business, no matter how great, can survive for long without a regular flow of new sales.</p><p> So before we even start talking about the mechanics of finding good prospects, we tell them that they must first understand and embrace the notion that they have to &ldquo;sell themselves and their practice.&rdquo; But selling doesn&rsquo;t have to be about whipping out your PowerPoint presentation on your system for investing.</p><p> Advisors have to become more than just good advisors &ndash; they have to build a sales focused practice. That means devoting time to prospecting each and every day.</p><p> Years ago while working at Merrill Lynch in New York, I heard eight advisors talk about their practices and how they had become successful. What struck me most was that although they couldn&rsquo;t have been more different &ndash; there was the proverbial red suspenders guy, the quiet shy guy, the newbie etc ---- they shared one common practice: each prospected every single day and met people they didn&rsquo;t know before.</p><p> In their prospecting efforts, advisors also need to develop sales strategies and set goals.

{"original_id":5634,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Smart and Simple Money Tips for New Grads","link":"6-smart-and-simple-money-tips-for-new-grads","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Graduating college is a huge achievement, deserving of the celebrations that typically go along with it. With a diploma in hand, you can see the world open wide for you, and the possibilities for your future can seem endless. On the other hand, adulthood comes with rent, car payments, job searches and student loan repayments&mdash;and the financial demands can also seem endless.</p><p> Here are six tips for recent grads to help you stay financially responsible while trying to get your life in the real world started.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Develop a budget or spending plan. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Think about your monthly income and what expenses you have. First, consider your basic needs, such as food, shelter and clothing. How much money do you need for groceries, rent, gas and utilities? Devise a budget and stick with it.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Make sure you have a student loan repayment plan. </strong></h3><p> <br/> According to  <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/\" target=\"_blank\">  studentaid.ed.gov </a> , recent grads have several options for repaying their student loans. Ignoring the situation is not one of them. Even if you can&rsquo;t make a payment, you have to deal with it responsibly and devise a strategy to repay it when you can. There are options such as lowering the monthly payment or applying for a deferment or forbearance, which stops the student loan bill for a determined amount of time. Visit www.StudentLoans.Gov for more details.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Start a rainy day fund. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Put extra money aside for emergencies. Life is uncertain: the car could have issues, or you could have a dental or medical problem. You want to have enough cash on hand to cover any of these kinds of situations when they inevitably occur. Furthermore, consider the domino effect: if the car needs to be fixed, how are you getting to work? Always think, &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; And plan ahead.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Know your credit history. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Being financially responsible decreases the odds of falling behind on bills, which can damage your credit score. A poor credit score may result in higher interest rates when applying for loans. If you have bad credit, you might not qualify for a car loan or mortgage. It could even cause issues in attaining a good job. Also, many landlords will check your credit history before renting you an apartment. You can check your credit report for free at  <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  www.annualcreditreport.com </a> . The site is a helpful resource for learning about credit scores and obtaining tips to improve a spotty credit history.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  5. Protect yourself with insurance. </strong></h3><p> <br/> According to the  <a href=\"http://www.naic.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  National Association of Insurance Commissioners </a>  (NAIC), the average renter&rsquo;s insurance policy costs between $15 and $30 per month. Renter&rsquo;s insurance provides a safety net in case you get robbed or your apartment burns down. You might think it&rsquo;d be cheaper to replace stolen or damaged items, but being held liable for an accident in the apartment would be more costly. And some landlords may require you to have it.</p><p> Health insurance is definitely required. Your employer likely offers this benefit. However, even if you don&rsquo;t have that option, health care can still be accessible and affordable. At  <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">  www.healthcare.gov </a> , you can find several options for recent college grads.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Start thinking about retirement. </strong></h3><p> <br/> What, you can&rsquo;t possibly be thinking about retirement!? Think again. Sure, you&rsquo;re young and just starting out. However, it is crucial that you start retirement planning as soon as possible. Think of it as wealth accumulation. It&rsquo;s a trifecta: Time value of money, tax deferred growth and compound interest all working for you to help you accumulate wealth for your future. Plus, if your employer offers a match or contribution to your 401(k), you need to take advantage of that. Don&rsquo;t leave money on the table.</p><p> Using these simple tips will make life easier and more affordable&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll be well on your journey to wealth creation.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 14:12:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 14:12:08.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_9bnBkqB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-smart-and-simple-money-tips-for-new-grads/\", \"post_id\": \"12074\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 14:12:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 14:12:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-smart-and-simple-money-tips-for-new-grads\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12073\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5864\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6-Smart-and-Simple-Money-Tips-for-New-Grads.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"762\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467129600,"author_id":320,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5636,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Brexit: What's My Advice to Investors? It's Quite Simple ...","link":"brexit-whats-my-advice-to-investors-its-quite-simple","source_link":null,"content":"<p> British voters shocked the world last week with their 52% to 48% decision to leave the European Union. The uncertainty of how this complex divorce will play out over the coming decade sent global markets reeling. London&rsquo;s Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 lost 4.4% of its value in one day, and the British pound sterling was down 14% against the yen and 10% against the dollar. The financial news media went berserk.</p><h3> Britain has two years after notifying the EU of its intention to leave to negotiate its exit with policy makers, so we can expect the markets to remain volatile for some time. Why all the fuss?</h3><p> <br/> The thinking is that British companies will lose access to the European market for duty-free trade and financial services. Some think London will no longer be able to function as Europe&rsquo;s financial center as it has done, since companies have long seen Britain as the gateway to free trade with the 28 nations in the EU. Eventually, Britain could lose American investment and manufacturing jobs that would move across the channel to mainland Europe. However, this is all speculation. Nobody knows exactly how the Brexit will play out long-term.</p><p> One reason it's unwise to assume the worst is because the Brexit vote is not legally binding on the government. Since British Prime Minister David Cameron resigned his post and called for a new election by October, it's possible the new government might decide to delay withdrawing from the EU. Or Parliament could instruct the new prime minister not to notify the EU that Britain is withdrawing until the government has had a chance to study further the implications. There could even be a second referendum to undo the first.</p><h3> Given all these uncertainties, what was and continues to be my advice to investors? It's quite simple: do nothing.</h3><p> <br/> The current market disruptions represent an emotional roller coaster, a short-term panic reaction to what is likely to be a very long-term, well-constructed exit from the EU. British companies were certainly not 4% less valuable the day after the vote than the day before, and the pound sterling is not suddenly a second-rate currency. The US, China, and Japan are not part of the EU. Global economies function fine and they will continue to function without Britain in the EU, just as they functioned well before the EU was created in 1989.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The emotions of traders and speculators are driving the short-term market responses to a long-term event that will be worked out by reasonable people who will have their nation&rsquo;s economic best interests at heart. Long-term investors who sold because of the Brexit will undoubtedly realize they were suckered and manipulated once again by panic masquerading as an assessment of real damage to the companies they&rsquo;ve invested in.</p><p> The good news is that long-term investors who are diversified have only a minority of their portfolios in equities. While the Brexit was not good in the short run for Britain's currency and global equity markets, it was a positive for investment vehicles. Gold, bonds, and managed futures all profited nicely upon the news of the Brexit. The strategy of global diversification worked&mdash;again. And, if equity markets decline sufficiently, long-term investors will be able to rebalance their portfolios by selling a portion of what has appreciated and buying equities. That is called \"selling high and buying low.\"</p><p> However much short-term disruption there may be, Britain and the EU will find a way to move through this unexpected event without too much damage. Like every other recent short-term financial calamity, Brexit will become just another blip on the long-term charts.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 15:06:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 15:06:22.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_HilrkJJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/brexit-whats-my-advice-to-investors-its-quite-simple/\", \"post_id\": \"12078\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 15:06:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 15:06:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"brexit-whats-my-advice-to-investors-its-quite-simple\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12077\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5866\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Brexit-Whats-My-Advice-to-Investors-Its-Quite-Simple.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"859\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467108000,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

The EU is an exquisite political dream. Yet many things are wrong with the present-state EU.</p><p> Watching Europe&rsquo;s political leaders react? Now that was excruciatingly wrong in so many more ways.</p><p> Leaders who don&rsquo;t have a clue. Literally, no clue about how to respond when an outcome stuns them. No idea what to say in a moment of defeat. No clue as to what they are truly thinking and feeling. And they call that leadership?</p><p> David Cameron. EU president Jean-Claude Juncker. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, making the media rounds. Re-enacting an outmoded leadership script. Acting like they&rsquo;re in command of the moment. Reassuring folks that things will be fine and the bureaucratic process works. Projecting control control control when it has just been ripped from them.</p><p> Robotic scripted platitude-driveling stone-faced stiff-upper-lip rubbish. Guilty, most of them. Blah blah blah blah blah.</p><p> So utterly out of touch. I want to say with the circumstances but, really, with themselves. And that is the ultimate leadership taboo.</p><p> We can be kind and say they were in shock. But, come on, you didn&rsquo;t think it could happen?</p><p> I&rsquo;m picking on European power brokers but similar leadership crimes are routinely committed by corporate and political leaders this side of the pond.</p><p> In a moment of duress, of crisis and unexpected turn of events, drop into a little bit of your own truth. Trust that it will resonate with their truth. That&rsquo;s how we move through and forward. Consider these simple tips:</p><h3> Drop the script.</h3><p> <br/> The script &ndash; that is the platitude-filled, easy-answer, sounds good but has no substance response to unforeseen circumstances. The script that reveals no genuine human response or nuanced reflection on what has occurred. The script that is supposed to comfort others but simply shows you&rsquo;re out of touch.</p><p> Yes, that script. It doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><h3> Stop the Compartmentalizing.</h3><p> <br/> Because you&rsquo;re smart, you want to think your way through the painful moment. Quickly. Your smarts are a tremendous asset, of course. They&rsquo;re one of the reasons you&rsquo;re a recognized leader. But because you&rsquo;re human, you have feelings. Don&rsquo;t intellectualize your feelings away. Breathe. Stay fully in your body. Remain whole. Remain fully human.</p><h3> Hear Your Truth.</h3><p> <br/> In the unexpected moment, everything conspires against you listening to yourself. The pace around you accelerates. Folks want you to spring into action. Every suggestion made will always, foremost, be an obvious one. Rarely the enlightened one.</p><p> Work against the rush. Find the quiet moment. The moment when you catch your heart beat. Hear your inner voice speak to you. You can animate this voice by asking yourself a simple question. What is the best next step, right here, right now? Ask and listen. Really listen. Unexpected wisdom will come.</p><p> And it will be a less obvious script.</p><p> Act like a leader by not putting on the leader show, by not spouting the easy rhetoric or predictable demagoguery.</p><p> Act like a leader by listening to others, yes, but foremost to yourself.</p><p> Have the courage to show us that you have heard.</p><p> It&rsquo;s really not that difficult.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 15:18:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 15:18:48.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_5OkzhpW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/avoid-your-own-brexit-leadership-crimes/\", \"post_id\": \"12080\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 15:18:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 15:18:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"avoid-your-own-brexit-leadership-crimes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12079\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5867\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Avoid-Your-Own-Brexit-Leadership-Crimes.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"739\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467111600,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}

Feeling equal parts excited and anxious &ndash; excited for all the obvious reasons like looking forward to rest and relaxation, time with my beloved family, golf, exercise, and mostly, stepping off the treadmill that is my everyday life for just a bit &ndash; but also anxious because I don&rsquo;t allow myself to step out of my role as CEO (&ldquo;Chief Everything Officer&rdquo;) easily.</p><p> It is my long-held belief that my world (actually, the whole world, if I&rsquo;m being honest) spins only because I make it do so. To be sure, I do play a vital role in both my professional and personal lives. I work double duty at Diamond Consultants &ndash; recruiter for financial advisors and leader of the business &ndash; and I know that my vision, leadership and skills make me a pretty essential character. And plenty of people rely on me as wife, mother, daughter, daughter-in-law, sister and friend.</p><p> I need not kid myself though; my business and my family and friends will do just fine in my absence.</p><p> In fact, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come to learn about time off over the years:</p><li> Taking a break every once in a while is the healthiest thing I can do for myself. It brings balance back to my always busy life, allows me to replenish, and actually fosters a sense of creativity, passion, joy and commitment: Meaning I return to my everyday life feeling more fulfilled, rejuvenated and ready to take on bigger and better things.</li><li> The time I take to replenish allows those who support me to step up to the plate: To shine, thrive, figure things out and be leaders. They can revel in the opportunity to grow, create and become more self-reliant, which in turn gives them a greater sense of purpose and confidence.</li><li> Pressing &ldquo;PAUSE&rdquo; means that the universe continues to do its thing whether I&rsquo;m manning mission control or not. Things unfold as they are meant to. In fact, when I let go, things often have a way of turning out better than I could have planned.</li><p> Vacations, mental health days &ndash; any time away from one&rsquo;s regular routine &ndash; are about exposing the myth that WE are in control. In reality, this couldn&rsquo;t be farther from the truth. I am constantly reminded that I can play my part, do my best and make good choices, but the outcome is not really up to me. At the end of the day, whether I close that deal, hit a hole-in-one or win the lottery is a function of a power much greater than the role I play at work or in life.</p><p> Sure, I know how to make the right connections and negotiate the best terms so that a financial advisor who wants to move to a new firm has the greatest chance of doing so. I also continue to work on my golf game in order to come even close to having that little white ball land on the green, and I have to buy the lottery ticket in order to stand the slightest chance of winning. Those things are all I can do &ndash; my very best in any situation &ndash; then I must detach from the outcome. The reality is that in the end, things are going to work out as they were meant to, no matter whether I&rsquo;ve hit &ldquo;PAUSE&rdquo; or I&rsquo;m in &ldquo;GO&rdquo; mode.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> With summer almost upon us, I think it&rsquo;s a great time to unplug, even if only for a day. I have always done my best thinking in the shower and I believe verily that it&rsquo;s because I am not thinking about work then: It&rsquo;s generally early in the morning and my mind has not yet revved itself to full speed. In the quiet, I give my brain the space it needs to wander. Invariably, that wandering leads to a creative idea that I am certain I wouldn&rsquo;t have had at a busier time. If one creative spark can be born in the span of a 10 to 15-minute shower, just think what&rsquo;s possible in the span of a week away?</p><p> So give yourself the chance to hit the PAUSE button. The world promises to continue to spin in your absence. And if it doesn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s nothing you could have done to change it anyhow.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 15:28:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 15:28:13.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_wXV5Azk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-giving-yourself-the-chance-to-hit-the-pause-button/\", \"post_id\": \"12082\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 15:28:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 15:28:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-giving-yourself-the-chance-to-hit-the-pause-button\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12081\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5868\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-You-Giving-Yourself-the-Chance-to-Hit-the-PAUSE-Button.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"823\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467136800,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5639,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Does Brexit Mean for FinTech UK?","link":"what-does-brexit-mean-for-fintech-uk","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I have to say that I&rsquo;m quietly positive after spending the weekend considering the consequences on London, the banking industry, Fintech and more. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to see the meltdown the doomsayers are rumour mongering, and I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to see the end of passporting our bank services across Europe.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"503\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Brexit1.jpg\" width=\"499\"/></p><p> Instead, I see two scenarios most likely to play out.</p><h3> Scenario One <br/>  </h3><p> David Cameron stepped down in a brilliant move that leaves Boris is in Catch22.  The expectation had been that David Cameron would use Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on Friday, the day the vote came in, and then would stay until the process was completed.  There were many declarations of support made on Friday morning for David to Remain as PM. But he stepped down saying, 'Why should I do the hard shit?' apparently.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"838\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Brexit2.jpg\" width=\"660\"/></p><p> This was a tactical move as, by not filing for Article 50, he&rsquo;s left it to his successor to deal with the hard shit.  That&rsquo;s going to most likely be Boris and his position is best summarised by a comment by Teebs in the Guardian&rsquo;s live coverage of developments during the weekend. Teebs believes that Cameron&rsquo;s resignation has Boris &ldquo;out-manoeuvred and check-mated. If [Boris] runs for leadership of the party, and then fails to follow through on triggering Article 50, then he is finished. If he does not run and effectively abandons the field, then he is finished. If he runs, wins and pulls the UK out of the EU, then it will all be over &ndash; Scotland will break away, there will be upheaval in Ireland, a recession &hellip; broken trade agreements. Then he is also finished. Boris Johnson knows all of this.&rdquo;</p><p> This is why Boris was really subdued on Friday and rather than looking smug, proud and a winner, he looked worried, concerned and a bit of a loser.</p><p> There&rsquo;s already been mention that the vote does not force us to Leave, but that it&rsquo;s a general wish which can be over-ruled by a Parliamentary vote and is not legally binding. This would be awkward but I think that the following events are most likely:</p><li> Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister</li><li> Boris does not trigger Article 50</li><li> Boris goes to Brussels and begs for Reform</li><li> Boris returns with two key concessions that the Leave campaign demanded and Europe hasn&rsquo;t given: <li>  allowing the UK to leave the free movement of European people structures, and bring in domestic control of our own borders, therefore limiting migration movements; and </li> <li>  exemption from the Common Agricultural Policy, which the campaign claims costs the UK billions and all goes directly into French Farmers pockets based upon a rule from 1957 that is out-of-date and unfair. </li></li><li> Boris returns with said reforms and announces a second Referendum before he will trigger Article 50, based upon the achievement of these key concessions</li><li> The second referendum results in Remain gaining a resounding win, now that the leaders of the Leave campaign back the Remain vote. <br/>  </li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Scenario Two <br/>  </h3><p> It is viewed as unconstitutional for Britain to have a second referendum, and European leaders place immense pressure on the country to fast track their exit from the Union, whilst shoring up the structure for the remaining 27 countries by giving key concessions and reforms being demanded by the likes of France, the Netherlands and Italy.</p><p> This results in many key questions:</p><li> Will Brits need new passports?</li><li> Will they still be welcome in Europe?</li><li> Will taxes rise?</li><li> How will places that receive EU subsidies be funded?</li><li> What about all the promises that were made that are now nought?</li><li> What about my European [name country] better half? <br/>  </li><p> and more.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Then we come to banking, and there&rsquo;s a whole raft of other questions: what about MiFID, PSD2, passporting, capital requirements, solvency, governance, structures etc.</p><p> Now here we have all the hysterical media writing about doom for Fintech London, doom for Banking Britain and doom for the UK economy.</p><p> Yea, yea, yea. Sorry, but this doesn&rsquo;t wash and is the reason why the Remain campaign lost. David Cameron and his cronies became unbelievable as every day someone warned that Britain was doomed economically if they voted to Leave.  In fact, even those who wanted to Remain got fed up with each daily headline from the IMF, the Bank of England, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Monster Raving Looney Party all saying the world would collapse if we voted to Leave.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Brexit3.jpg\" width=\"768\"/></p><p> Image from  <a href=\"http://www.electomatic.com/political-meme-tracker/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Electomatic </a></p><p> What&rsquo;s the reality?  Nothing has changed.  All the rules and regulations of Europe are in place today, just as they were on Wednesday before we voted to Leave.  Therefore, what changes now is how we negotiate the Exit after Article 50 is triggered, and what we choose not to keep and what Europe determines not to deal with in a non-EU member state.</p><p> In other words, it would be Europe&rsquo;s choice to punish Britain for choosing to Exit by withdrawing bank passporting. Will they do that?  If they were led by the French yes, but they&rsquo;re not. They&rsquo;re led by the Germans and Angela Merkel has already tried to calm the waters by saying this will not be a nasty Exit.</p><p> So this is the key question: will Europe choose to ruin London, the British economy and Fintech by using the one card they hold that could possibly do that: removal of bank passporting.</p><p> This is the critical question. If they don&rsquo;t, then London remains the global centre it always has and nothing changes.  If they do, then most banks will need to relocate to Europe and will probably choose Dublin, as it&rsquo;s nearest to US shores and almost speaks the same language.

Fiduciary standard vs. suitability standard <br/>  </h3><p> The rule is basically imposing a fiduciary standard on providing investment advice in the retirement setting. This replaces the long-standing suitability standard. Advisors now have to act in the best interest of their clients rather than providing investments that are suitable. The rule relates only to retirement-related investment advice, but of course, that can be a significant portion of the business.</p><h3> 2. Conflicts of interest <br/>  </h3><p> The primary emphasis is on avoiding or providing complete disclosure concerning conflicts of interest. For example, recommending products which earn you or the firm additional commissions. The Rule establishes a new regiment for disclosure and provides for a &ldquo;Best Interest Contract Exemption.&rdquo; The detailed compliance requirements may favor the large firms because of the resources required to implement website and data comparisons.</p><h3> 3. One potential consequence: growth of fee-only advisement on retirement accounts <br/>  </h3><p> If the compensation received is fee-only, then there is no conflict of interest. Smaller and mid-size firms may not be able to efficiently implement all the compliance layers required by the DOL rule. The entire retirement investment landscape could be impacted significantly.</p><h3> 4. Effective date of the Rule: April 2017 <br/>  </h3><p> Seems like a long time in the future, but with the detailed compliance issues that will have to be addressed, time is of the essence.</p><h3> 5. Any relief coming? <br/>  </h3><p> Congress has passed resolutions nullifying the rule, but the resolutions will be vetoed and the votes to override do not exist. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others have filed a lawsuit asking a federal court to decide that the Rule is outside of DOL&rsquo;s authority. Whether that lawsuit will have any effect is unknown, but a quick decision from the court is not likely. So, the better approach is to plan on the Rule being effective in April 2017.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> A Final Thought <br/>  </h3><p> If the Fiduciary Rule goes into effect with no further changes, the retirement investment advisory business will continue. It may change, but it will not go away. As with other market changes, those advisors who embrace the change will be more successful than those who ignore it.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 16:05:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 16:05:51.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_5iNwSps.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-legal-musings-on-the-department-of-labor-fiduciary-rule/\", \"post_id\": \"12088\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 16:05:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 16:05:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-legal-musings-on-the-department-of-labor-fiduciary-rule\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12087\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5870\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5-Legal-Musings-on-the-Department-of-Labor-Fiduciary-Rule.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"635\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467104400,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}

Yet, as we have stressed throughout the referendum campaign, nothing actually happens immediately. In order to leave the EU, the British government needs to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which will require parliamentary approval. Triggering Article 50 would put the UK on a two-year countdown to exit. However, it&rsquo;s not in the country&rsquo;s interests to do this quickly&mdash;even if the rest of the EU might want it to depart from the union swiftly.</p><p> Given the complexities involved in dissolving a 43-year long economic and political relationship, Brexit might not become a reality for several years.</p><h3> Impact on Markets <br/>  </h3><p> The big question now is what impact Brexit is likely to have on economies and financial markets around the world?</p><p> For the UK, the answer is fairly obvious: Brexit is almost certain to weigh on near-term growth. But even in the UK, it&rsquo;s hard to gauge the magnitude of the hit to the economy. As a result, we don&rsquo;t expect any immediate action from the Bank of England beyond the provision of short-term liquidity support. Rate cuts are clearly on the cards later this year, as is another round of quantitative easing if things get really bad. But first, the Bank will want to see some data.</p><p> What about the global economy? The direct impact of Brexit beyond the UK&rsquo;s borders is likely to be small so the reaction of financial markets will be crucial. So far, the omens are not good, as investors deserted risk assets and rushed to safe havens amid a spike in volatility following the referendum. However, we don&rsquo;t think Brexit will be a Lehman-like event. Brexit has always been a &ldquo;known&rdquo; unknown for which central banks have had a long time to prepare. Ultimately, market turbulence is likely to subside. But it could give another nudge towards easier monetary policy in several countries and help keep global interest rates &ldquo;lower for longer.&rdquo;</p><h3> Political Questions <br/>  </h3><p> The Brexit vote also raises big political questions. In the UK, Prime Minister David Cameron has already promised to step down and the prospect of another referendum on independence for Scotland&mdash;where a majority voted to stay in the EU&mdash;looms large. However, some observers have gone further, and questioned whether or not Brexit might trigger a wave of referendums in other countries and therefore mark the beginning of the end for the EU.</p><p> In our view, the appetite for copycat referendums in other EU countries is likely to be low, at least in the near term. Moreover, it&rsquo;s possible that last night&rsquo;s vote will act as a wake-up call for the EU and push it towards more fundamental reform. Britain&rsquo;s departure could force the EU to recognize the areas in which it has overreached itself and to acknowledge the different aims and ambitions of its disparate membership&mdash;particularly with respect to deeper integration. If so, the EU might eventually emerge even stronger. But for now, we are clearly entering a difficult period in which political risk is likely to remain a recurring feature of the European investment landscape.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 16:09:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 16:09:39.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_b38Mp2f.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/brexit-ship-appears-to-have-sailed-but-may-take-years-to-reach-destination/\", \"post_id\": \"12090\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 16:09:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 16:09:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"brexit-ship-appears-to-have-sailed-but-may-take-years-to-reach-destination\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12089\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5871\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Brexit-Ship-Appears-to-Have-Sailed-But-May-Take-Years-to-Reach-Destination.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"862\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467100800,"author_id":16,"chart_url":""}

The constant demand from the media for information that was timely, on-message, and accurate was relentless.</p><p> Interestingly enough, it was also the period in my life when I felt the most energized and invigorated. After 20 years as an investigator, I needed the boost of adrenaline that a fast-paced environment gave me.</p><h3> As entrepreneurs, sales executives, and leaders, you are stressed by deadlines, responsibilities, and your ever-increasing workload. You may be worried that stress is interfering with your job performance and even your health. <br/>  </h3><p> The conventional wisdom about stress warns that too much of it can cause high blood pressure, heart attacks, and other health hazards. Although non-stop stress can be harmful, recent research is providing new insight into how measured doses of stress can actually enhance our performance.</p><p> Our brains are hard-wired so that it is difficult for us to take action until we feel stress or anxiety. Mentally strong people are able to manage their emotions, thoughts, and behavior in optimal levels to achieve top performance.</p><h3> Here are 4 mental toughness tools to help you keep stress levels in check: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. DEVELOP THE RIGHT MINDSET <br/>  </h3><p> In the past, psychologists believed that it was the amount of stress that was bad for a person&rsquo;s health. But in recent studies it&rsquo;s become clear that the amount of stress is a surprisingly poor predictor of whether it will leave you better, or worse, off.</p><p> New research from Yale University and Shawn Achor, author of The Happiness Advantage, reveal that people can be divided into two groups:</p><li> those who believe that stress-is-debilitating, and</li><li> those who believe that stress-is-enhancing.</li><p> The Yale Study found that people who had stress-is-enhancing mindsets reported having better health, greater life satisfaction, and superior work performance.</p><p> Stress produces cortisol&mdash;too much or too little cortisol release in response to a stressor can have negative physiological consequences.</p><p> The Yale research, in combination with Achor&rsquo;s findings, paint a very clear picture:</p><p> \"Stress is killing you if you believe it is. Studies confirm that people who die from stress do not die from stress itself, but from the belief that stress was bad for them. Those who do not believe it is harmful experience no negative side effects on their health.\"</p><p> If you can use mental toughness to manage your mindset, you will see challenges you face as opportunities to grow and learn. In addition, you will be both happier and more productive.</p><h3> 2. USE SELF-TALK TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS <br/>  </h3><p> We all know that anxiety can hurt performance and most of us have been in situations when we were anxious, couldn&rsquo;t think straight, and experienced temporary lapses in memory.</p><p> Too much cortisol and our performance withers, but people who are calm experience too little cortisol and their performance also withers.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The key is learning how to manage your emotions with self-talk and using the right words when controlling your thoughts.</p><p> In a study published by the Journal of Experimental Psychology, people who told themselves that they were excited about the challenge ahead of them performed significantly better than those who told themselves that they were calm.</p><p> \"If you are excited about your job or task, you will be more persuasive, competent, confident, and persistent. You will grit-up with the mental toughness to change the way you label your feelings and emotions&mdash;from stressful to exciting. This helps create a shift toward a more positive mindset.\"</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 3. BE GRATEFUL <br/>  </h3><p> Taking the time to be grateful lessens anxiety because it reduces the stress hormone cortisol. Professor Robert Emmons conducted a study at the University of California, Davis, of over 1,000 people, from ages 8 to 80. They found that those who cultivate an attitude of gratitude experienced a host of benefits:</p><li> Stronger immune systems and lower blood pressure</li><li> Higher levels of positive emotions</li><li> More joy, optimism, and happiness</li><li> Acting with more generosity and compassion</li><li> Feeling less lonely and isolated <br/>  </li><h3> 4. REIGNITE THE INNER FIRE <br/>  </h3><p> The higher levels of stress that I experienced as the FBI spokesperson brought me closer to understanding what fired up my heart. Because of the constant deadlines, I found myself doing two things:</p><p> 1) Focusing on what I liked to do, and 2) delaying until later or delegating to others the things I didn&rsquo;t like to do.</p><p> One of the things I loved to do was gather stories from other agents and then work with reporters on getting those stories out to the public. I delayed as long as possible doing the record checks and going through files for details of an investigation.</p><p> When I created stories around FBI best practices and shared them with others, I knew that the audience would benefit from the life lessons that twirled all around me.</p><p> The stress imposed upon me by my job forced me to prioritize, and in those priorities I found where my heart was leading: I wanted to write and share the lessons I learned from my time as an FBI agent with others.</p><p> For stress to be beneficial, it&rsquo;s important to find meaning in your work . Research has shown that workers in high-stress jobs like air-traffic controllers and intensive-care nurses thrive under heavy stress if they are positive about the future and find their work meaningful.</p><p> You cannot be stressed out and empowered at the same time! Be mentally strong and keep your anxiety from taking over.</p><p> When has stress enabled you to perform at your best?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 16:13:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 16:13:57.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_6FSJgtL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-mental-toughness-tools-to-help-you-keep-stress-levels-in-check/\", \"post_id\": \"12092\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 16:13:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 16:13:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-mental-toughness-tools-to-help-you-keep-stress-levels-in-check\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12091\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5872\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4-Mental-Toughness-Tools-to-Help-You-Keep-Stress-Levels-in-Check.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"693\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467115200,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5643,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Insights to Be Gleaned from Brexit Vote?","link":"insights-to-be-gleaned-from-brexit-vote","source_link":null,"content":"<p> So, it&rsquo;s happened. For good or ill, the UK electorate has voted for &lsquo;Brexit&lsquo;; that is to leave the European Union (EU).</p><p> There will be plenty of coverage over coming weeks &amp; months. Much will cover political or economic implications &amp; the many options ahead.</p><p> But the focus of this blog is customer insight. So, what can the Brexit vote reveal for our specialism? Are there lessons to be learned for those using behavioural economics, research or data visualisation to understand &amp; explain customers actions?</p><h3> Where was Status Quo bias? <br/>  </h3><p> Given our interest in the application of Behavioural Economics, to interpreting both behavioural analytics and research results, one bias didn&rsquo;t play as much of a role as expected. A number of commentators had followed past British voting behaviour &amp; suggested that &lsquo;status quo&rsquo; bias would play a major role. That means the unconscious bias, whereby people will choose to remain with the status quo, when they find decisions complex or too demanding. Often this is followed by post-rationalising more sophisticated reasons for their &lsquo;choice&rsquo;.</p><h3> Research &amp; forecasting public opinion <br/>  </h3><p> But beyond our focus on behavioural biases, we are also interested in best practice research. For that reason, elections are normally a great opportunity to test the robustness of polling methods &amp; forecasts made. Of course, referendums like this are a much rarer event and so harder for pollsters to predict accurately. Undecided voters and &lsquo;shy brexiters&rsquo; can come from a more diverse demographic distribution than traditional voting heartlands. Nevertheless, it must be disappointing for a number of polling agencies, that most appear to have called this one wrong too.</p><h3> Brexit data visualizations can be so unhelpful <br/>  </h3><p> As well as great resources available online (like Andrew&rsquo;s very consistent stats blog), events like this also highlight the opportunity for poor quality data, analysis or research. The case that struck me most this time was a truly awful data visualisation. Not only is it rather distressing, on a day when almost half of the UK population is feeling raw about the result. It also completely fails to convey any useful numbers, nor insights as a result. </p><h3> That&rsquo;s all, I can manage today, folks <br/>  </h3><p> That&rsquo;s plenty for now. To be honest, the result has left me a bit shell-shocked today and I&rsquo;m finding it hard to concentrate on my normal blogging output.</p><p> Anyway, I hope that content was useful &amp; topical for you. Whether you are delighted or gutted today, I wish you a peaceful weekend and an insightful summer.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 16:56:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 16:56:20.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_Ic1R7Xy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/insights-to-be-gleaned-from-brexit-vote/\", \"post_id\": \"12093\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 16:56:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 16:56:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"insights-to-be-gleaned-from-brexit-vote\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12091\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5873\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4-Mental-Toughness-Tools-to-Help-You-Keep-Stress-Levels-in-Check.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"455\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467126000,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5644,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Business Strategies to Help Boost Employee Engagement","link":"6-business-strategies-to-help-boost-employee-engagement","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> It&rsquo;s no secret that unhappy employees can have a serious impact on your company&rsquo;s bottom line, from lost productivity to lowered quality of work to retention costs. <br/>  </h3><p> It's estimated that disengaged employees lose organizations between $450 and $500 billion each year. That's a whole lot of moolah.</p><p> However, the opposite is just as true, and an engaged workforce can dramatically improve company returns. In fact, the Harvard Business Review found that in comparison with dissatisfied workers, happy employees:</p><li> Are 31% more productive </li><li> Generate 37% more sales </li><li> Are three times more creative </li><p> So if it seems obvious that happy employees produce better results, perhaps the better question is, how do we help workers achieve satisfaction in their roles?</p><p> A recent post from Good.Co lists six elements that are important for building an engaged workforce. The benefit of each of their recommendations is that they can have immediate impacts on employee engagement. We&rsquo;re going to look at specific ways you can implement them and start building a healthier work culture today.</p><h3> 1. Screen new hires <br/>  </h3><p> One of the most important factors companies should consider before adding a new member is whether or not they fit in with the team culture. When people work closely together, it&rsquo;s extremely important that they&rsquo;re on the same wavelength in order to cut down on miscommunication, office drama, and other unnecessary intangibles that can get in the way of productivity. The following are ways for you to ensure that prospective employees match up well with your organizational values:</p><li> Know your values: If you don&rsquo;t know what your organization stands for, it&rsquo;s impossible for a potential candidate to.</li><li> Ask about theirs: What does this person value in an organization? How do their personal goals line up with your company&rsquo;s? If the candidate you&rsquo;re interviewing wants to be on the fast track to executive leadership but your organization emphasizes collaboration over hierarchy, they may not be a perfect fit.</li><li> Have team members interview them: Probably the best way to gauge how a new employee will fit in with your current crew is to let them take part in interviewing them. Current employees will appreciate having their opinion valued and will likely even feel better about the final choice since they had a chance to vet each interviewee.</li><h3> 2. Develop company-wide volunteer initiatives <br/>  </h3><p> Coordinating out-of-the-office work activities can be tricky, but these excursions can add a huge boost to team engagement. According to an infographic from Good.Co, 93% of employees who volunteered with their employer reported being happy with their job. Doing good, inspiring work with fellow employees can infuse individuals with a stronger connection to their company. Luckily, there are plenty of ways for businesses to take advantage of volunteer opportunities.</p><li> The first place to check is within the company. There may be partnerships with various charities already in place that you can take advantage of.</li><li> The Hands On Network helps lead volunteer activities for businesses, so managers don&rsquo;t have to focus as much on planning events and can instead work to rally team members to a joint cause. They also have 245 locations across the United States, so check to see if there&rsquo;s one near you.</li><li> Finally, check Google or look in your local directory to find charities near you. There are plenty of great causes in need of willing volunteers. Help give back and engage your employees at the same time. It&rsquo;s a win-win for everyone!</li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 3. Recognize employee accomplishments <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s hard to stay engaged with a company when you don&rsquo;t feel appreciated. Making sure you&rsquo;re taking the time to recognize employee accomplishments is a huge deal &mdash; whether or not they&rsquo;ve accomplished something major. Not only will you show that you&rsquo;re paying attention to who&rsquo;s doing a great job, but you&rsquo;ll also be making sure your employees feel appreciated. Here are some ways how:</p><li> Give them a shout-out during stand-up meetings: If someone went above and beyond, make a note of it and mention how awesome it was in front of their colleagues.</li><li> Stop by their desk: Drop by and give them a high five in person.</li><li> Treat them to a gift card: It&rsquo;s not always in your power to hand out bonuses, but for someone who consistently puts out excellent work, doing something as simple as giving them a gift card can go a long way towards showing how much you appreciate them.</li><li> Set up a one-on-one lunch &mdash; and treat them: This will also give you the chance to get to know them better and chat about their professional goals.</li><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4. Emphasize work-life balance <br/>  </h3><p> One of the biggest complaints employees have is being worked too hard. You don&rsquo;t want anyone getting burnt out, so if you notice that someone&rsquo;s consistently staying late or working over the weekend, make sure you&rsquo;re taking appropriate steps to get them back on track. Try some of the following:</p><li> Call them over for a brief one-on-one: Just have a quick chat and see what&rsquo;s going on. Find out what&rsquo;s keeping them so late, and see if there are ways you can help balance some of their workload.</li><li> Keep them in the hiring loop: Workers may be taking on additional responsibilities because the company is short-staffed at the moment. If that&rsquo;s the case, let them know what the plans are for finding them relief. In the meantime, see if there are ways you can cut out less important tasks they&rsquo;re doing, and remember to recognize that they&rsquo;re doing a great job (see above).</li><li> Invite them on breaks: There&rsquo;s no better way to show workers that breaks are encouraged than making sure to take them yourself. Even better, invite your employees along and use this time to get to know them and ask about their interests outside of the office.</li><h3> 5. Encourage workplace friendships <br/>  </h3><p> Similar to volunteering with their organization, employees who have people they can talk to and socialize with in the workplace are found to be much happier with their company overall. You can&rsquo;t force people to get along with each other, but here are some ways to help foster these relationships.</p><li> Set up after-work happy hours: Give coworkers a chance to let their hair down in front of one another and socialize in a comfortable setting. Try to make sure things don&rsquo;t get too out of hand, but also trust your employees to be adults and handle themselves accordingly.</li><li> Give them volunteer opportunities: Doing good work for a worthy cause is great for everyone involved.</li><li> Hold team lunches and split into groups: Take time to bring the team together for a lunch. It provides an easy environment that can act as an oasis within the corporate office.</li><h3> 6. Focus on employee strengths <br/>  </h3><p> Similar to calling out employee accomplishments, when reviewing your workers, make sure to focus on addressing what they do well. Having this kind of affirmation from a manager has been shown to increase employee engagement across the board, as workers feel themselves valuable.</p><li> Connect accomplishments to strengths: Make note of the things people excel at, and connect them to positive strengths. Whether they&rsquo;re great at organizing, thinking big-picture, or creating Excel files, make sure to focus on these skills during reviews.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t harp on mistakes: Let employees know what they need to work on, but don&rsquo;t talk their ear off about it all day. This will only make them feel devalued and will further disengage them. Instead, make your feedback a complete picture by also talking them up about their strengths.</li><li> Create cards for different strengths: A fun idea is to give employees cards for their strengths. Hand them out at team meetings so everyone can see the positive contribution they&rsquo;re making.</li><p> There are many more ways to get your employees engaged, the important thing is to make an active effort. Treat this article as a guideline, and come up with your own ways to uniquely appreciate your workers.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 17:07:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 17:07:07.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_3M4HcGZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-business-strategies-to-help-boost-employee-engagement/\", \"post_id\": \"12095\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 17:07:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 17:07:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-business-strategies-to-help-boost-employee-engagement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12094\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5874\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6-Business-Strategies-to-Help-Boost-Employee-Engagement.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"574\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467122400,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}

People around us seem to behave differently; some friends and family stick to you like glue with their love and support while others abruptly vanish.</p><p> Depending on the circumstances, your &ldquo;soon-to-be ex&rdquo; can become nearly unrecognizable, hiding behind a mask of hurtful words and unloving behavior. And you? You are left standing with feelings of guilt laced with rejection. I &lsquo;get&rsquo; it&hellip;I &lsquo;get&rsquo; you&hellip;because that was me. And not just once but, three times. </p><p> Guilt by definition is &ldquo;the feeling of responsibility or remorse for some offense, crime, wrong, etc. whether real or imagined&rdquo;.</p><p> For many of us, a divorce will trigger feelings of guilt. All too often we have done things to others that we are not proud of, hurting the other deeply&hellip;as well as ourselves. Speaking from my own experience, ill behavior by both parties resulted in divorce. I was left a single parent of a 14-month-old child, with very little money&hellip;and dressed in guilt (that was my 2nd divorce&mdash;similar patterns repeated in the 3rd along with the arrival of my second child).</p><p> The most challenging was the guilt I had attached to money. Money is a survival issue&hellip;and I was alone to raise first one child, then two.  &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I save more?&rdquo; &ldquo;I should not have given him money to pay for his car, his tuition, etc.&rdquo; &ldquo;What have I been spending my money on? I&rsquo;m drowning in debt!&rdquo; Oftentimes my guilt over money would throw me into a state of panic and anxiety, rendering me powerless. I felt like a fool. </p><p> &ldquo;The only way to heal the wounds of the past, ultimately, is to forgive them and let them go.&rdquo; ~ Marianne Williamson, A Return to Love.</p><p> If you let it, guilt will render you disabled and sabotage any chance you have of experiencing true wealth and success. Guilt is a negative emotion attached to the past and takes root in fear. In order to release the guilt, you must change the negative thoughts and feelings surrounding your divorce and money. The only way to do this is through forgiveness&hellip;forgive yourself of any and all perceived wrong-doing as well as your former spouse/partner. Forgiveness is the path that leads you out of the past and into the present moment. Real transformation of the self and your financial circumstances comes from the consciousness with which you are doing it. To be conscious is to be in the present moment. Therefore, real transformation cannot occur so long as you harbor feelings of guilt or any other negative emotion or thought. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If you have feelings of guilt about your divorce I now ask you, &ldquo;Are you ready and willing to feel better now? Are you ready and willing to release your guilt, release the past, so that you may move into the present moment and make the necessary changes to create a life of financial empowerment and joy?&rdquo; If you answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, here are a few ideas to help you on your path to transformation&hellip;</p><p> 1. Gain clarity on what your guilt is attached to&hellip; I suggest you record your thoughts and feelings in a journal. What is your story? Is your guilt attached to money, your ex-spouse/partner, your children? Be clear about accountability&hellip;own what is yours and recognize what is not. Take your time with this. Be gentle, be compassionate, be honest.</p><p> 2. If your guilt is attached to money&mdash;what dis-empowering expressions leave you &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;? Do you hear yourself saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never get myself out of debt.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never have enough money&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see myself getting out of this rut and having abundance and happiness.&rdquo; Time to create positive expressions to support what you want in your life. Key is&hellip;you must believe these new statements. So play, experiment. Try this&ndash;&ldquo;I have enough money to support all of my needs.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am very careful in how I spend my money.&rdquo; These new expressions can take the form of a prayer or affirmation. Either way, they will ease the guilt and open the channel to feeling empowered.</p><p> 3. &ldquo;Let go, let God&rdquo;&hellip;This always seems to work for me. After having done item #1&hellip;I take my journal and tear out the pages. I get a lighter and go outside. I then say something like a prayer, &ldquo;I forgive myself (and others by name) of all real and perceived wrong-doings. I release my guilt, I release my past. I step firmly into the present, now at peace.&rdquo; I take the lighter and burn the pages from the journal. So be it.</p><p> I believe we have a choice in how we learn and move through our life lessons and transitions. We can do so through joy or pain. Decisions are yours. Either way, the lesson will be learned. Personally, my lessons of guilt, divorce, bankruptcy, and forgiveness were learned through pain and suffering. I realize now that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way&hellip;for anyone.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-27 17:14:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-27 17:14:21.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_8VKtISw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/guilt-and-divorce-a-marriage-made-that-could-sabotage-your-wealth/\", \"post_id\": \"12099\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-27 17:14:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-27 17:14:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"guilt-and-divorce-a-marriage-made-that-could-sabotage-your-wealth\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12098\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5876\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Guilt-and-Divorce-A-Marriage-Made-That-Could-Sabotage-Your-Wealth.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"855\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467133200,"author_id":113,"chart_url":""}

As such, we pay close attention to important trends impacting the ETF industry and the advisers we serve. Our value proposition is anchored by our collaborative engagement with market participants, intermediaries and investment advisors that serve individual and institutional clients. This active engagement yields rich dialogue and constant opportunities to learn and grow. The combination of active engagement with stakeholders and the deep expertise offered by our investment professionals provides me with a rich viewpoint of the ETF marketplace. To this end, I offer the following perspectives on trends impacting the ETF marketplace. I hope that these unique insights will both peak your own intellectual curiosity and encourage your ongoing engagement with FlexShares as we seek to best serve you.</p><h3> <strong>  INDUSTRY OVERVIEW </strong></h3><p> <br/> Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) continue to be among the fastest growing product categories in the U.S. asset management industry with, a 10-year CAGR of 17.2%. In 2015, growth in the U.S. market increased +6.7% from the prior year to $2.1 trillion in assets as of 12/31/2015. U.S. listed ETFs attracted $235 billion in inflows in 2015, just shy of the $242 billion in flows from the prior year. The total assets at year-end (YE) represented a record total for the industry while flows logged their second best year ever. 2015 flows were driven primarily by international equity (+$103 billion), which more than doubled its inflows from 2014, thanks in part, to strong demand for currency hedged products. Taxable bonds finished with the second most inflows (+$56 billion), followed by U.S. equity (+$49 billion). It is important to note that the flows to international equities predominantly favored developed economies. Investors in U.S. equites continued to favor the ETF vehicle structure as U.S. equity mutual funds experienced outflows of (-$107) billion. ETFs also continue to take market share in the taxable bond category attracting (+$56 billion) in flows compared to (-$30) billion in outflows for taxable bond mutual funds.</p><p> In 2015, there were 277 new U.S. ETF listings but 99 fund closures bringing the YE fund total to 1,840. There was less concentration of fund flows among the top 3 providers as they accounted for $156 billion or 66% of fund flows. This compares to 80% during the prior year. Achieving $100 million in AUM within two years of listing is an accepted measure of initial success attributed to new product listings. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> A decade ago, nine out of ten ETF listings achieved this milestone versus about one in ten today. During the past two years, 464 new ETFs were listed with 62 (13%) of these funds exceeding the $100 million AUM milestone. This ratio decreased from 2014, when 23% of funds launched within the trailing two years exceeded the $100 million milestone.</p><p> Competition continues to intensify as new competitors enter the market. We assert that the keys to success in our industry are evolving due to changing investor attitudes and competitive dynamics. The number of U.S. sponsors has increased from 8 at the end of 2005 to 91 at the end of 2015. A net increase of 27 sponsors occurred in 2015, the most ever in a single year.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/record-industry-flows.png\" width=\"610\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sponsor-growth.png\" width=\"520\"/></p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  PRODUCT INNOVATION </strong></h3><p> <br/> The first stage of ETF product innovation focused almost exclusively on broad-based equity benchmark indexes. Institutions were primary users of ETFs with an emphasis on tactical applications such as hedging and transition management. This stage, which covered about a decade, gave birth to some of the largest ETFs today. The second stage of innovation witnessed an expansion into a variety of asset classes including fixed income, commodities and real estate. Driven by investor demand for global portfolio exposure, ETFs democratized access to these asset classes. The second stage of innovation was fueled by rising awareness among retail investors and financial advisors.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/witnessed-innovation.png\" width=\"378\"/></p><p> The current third leg of innovation is categorized by investor demand for distinctive investment strategies with particular interest in alternatively weighted index schemes. A variety of nomenclature is associated with these strategies including fundamentally weighted, factor weighted and the popular &ldquo;smart beta&rdquo;. While the lexicon may vary, the trend of growing investor demand for non-traditional index strategies is firmly established. More strategic use of ETFs by institutions such as public funds, foundations, endowments and asset managers combined with broader acceptance by financial advisors is driving flows to ETFs broadly and flows to alternative index strategies specifically. While the term &ldquo;smart beta&rdquo; is increasingly being used by investors, morningstar identifies 515 funds with their &ldquo;strategic beta&rdquo;. With assets of $455 billion and inflows of $66 billion in 2015, this sub-segment achieved a superior organic growth rate compared to the overall market (12% versus 7%). FlexShares is an emerging leader in this segment with our distinctive approach, which we refer to as &ldquo;Flexible Indexing&rdquo;.</p><p> At the close of 2015 there were 140 U.S. listed active ETFs with $22.7 billion of assets. While the number of new funds grew during the past year, active ETFs still account for just over 1 percent of U.S. ETF assets. Utilization has been muted since the introduction of the first active ETF in 2008.</p><p> The arrival of another competing vehicle structure in the form of exchange traded managed funds (ETMFs) gained regulatory approval in November 2014. This new exchange traded vehicle touts several benefits of ETFs with some notable differences. A unique feature of the new ETMF structure is that there is no daily disclosure requirement similar to that of ETFs. This non-transparent feature is more aptly targeted toward actively managed strategies. The ETMF will employ what is known as NAVbased trading so it will differ from ETFs as it will not have constant price discovery throughout the day, although the funds will be traded on exchanges. Though initially slated to launch in 2015, the first ETMF was recently listed on NASDAQ on February 25, 2016.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/continued-growth.png\" width=\"395\"/></p><p> Broad acceptance of actively-managed ETFs as well as new vehicles like the ETMF structure will require time and patience. In addition to notable regulatory hurdles for non-transparent active ETFs, broad user acceptance will also require investor education and infrastructure investment by market participants. Nonetheless, the incremental developments on the active front increase the prospects more established active fund managers will enter the ETF space through strategic alliances, acquisitions or de novo builds. As the regulatory picture for active ETFs becomes clearer, I expect actively managed ETFs to spur a fourth leg of innovation.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Our product strategy at FlexShares remains focused on non-traditional index strategies. The FlexShares&rsquo; philosophy centers on the investor. While that seems very basic, it is uncommon. Investors possess real goals. One individual investor may seek to fund a college education for their child through capital appreciation while another needs to manage inflation risk while providing income for retirement years. We start with investors&rsquo; goals because that&rsquo;s what matters but have to ask fundamentally different questions to identify the appropriate solution. We then construct strategies that best meet that objective, which we rigorously vet using empirical research and analysis.</p><p> DISTRIBUTION</p><p> There are three trends of particular interest as it pertains to ETF distribution. The first trend is the rising cost of distribution; marketing and distribution are critical success factors in the ETF industry. Intermediaries are aggressively seeking to monetize their client relationships through explicit distribution fees or more subtle marketing agreements. The result is higher distribution costs through traditional intermediary channels. This has also spurred strategic partnerships and is enabling existing asset management providers to join the fast growing ETF segment while leveraging and/or combining distribution capabilities.</p><p> The second trend relates to the strategic use of ETFs by institutions. The most recent Greenwich Institutional ETF User Survey (Q1 2016) suggests that 68 percent of institutional ETF assets are characterized as strategic in nature. Moreover, institutional users are identifying new applications for ETFs in their portfolios with a growing majority using them as a primary vehicle for implementation of long-term strategies. This has become increasingly important in asset classes such as fixed income where liquidity constraints resulting from regulatory and market structure changes have made it more difficult to manage diversified fixed income portfolios through traditional means. Additionally, asset managers are offering increasingly popular multi-asset class funds of which ETFs comprise about half of the portfolios. These developments create opportunities to distribute ETFs to various institutional client segments.</p><p> The third trend relates to disruptive innovation. While there are several innovations we are watching, developments in the Digital Investment Advisory (robo-advisor) space are timely and relevant. It is important to note that Digital Investment Advisory also represents an emerging distribution channel. By leading with a value proposition that emphasizes technology, simplicity and low cost, upstart digital investment advisors are seeking to appeal to underserved segments such as younger investors. Without ties to legacy platforms, processes or technology they offer mass customized solutions that can be delivered at low marginal costs. Many digital advisors are heavy users of ETFs and have the potential to become an important distribution channel for ETF sponsors. The most notable developments in 2015 were among established financial firms. Several leading asset managers entered the digital investment advisory space via acquisition, strategic partnerships or de novo build.</p><p> Distribution is evolving, particularly through the leverage of technology and new challenges. As client demographics change, the way to acquire and retain them changes. This is occurring more rapidly than some people think. Our strategy involves constant evaluation and engagement with all distribution channels that align with our value proposition.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/three-trends.png\" width=\"407\"/></p><h3> <strong>  LOOKING FORWARD </strong></h3><p> <br/> As an ETF sponsor of choice, FlexShares leverages deep investment expertise, collaborative relationships with investing clients and a rich fiduciary culture to deliver distinctive ETFs.

{"original_id":5648,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Failed Socialism: What's Next After the Brexit Referendum?","link":"failed-socialism-whats-next-after-the-brexit-referendum","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Defying sentiment polls leading up to last week&rsquo;s historic Brexit referendum, British voters said &ldquo;thanks, but no thanks&rdquo; to excessive EU taxation and regulation, choosing to take back Britain&rsquo;s sovereignty in financing, budgeting, immigration policy and other areas essential to a nation&rsquo;s self-identity.</h3>It was a momentous victory for the &ldquo;leave&rdquo; camp, led by former London mayor Boris Johnson and U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who invoked the 1990s sci-fi action film &ldquo;Independence Day&rdquo; by declaring June 23 &ldquo;our independence day&rdquo; from foreign rule.As I&rsquo;ve been saying the last couple of weeks, British citizens and businesses have grown fed up with an avalanche of <a href=\"/learn/global/what-brexit-is-all-about-taxation-and-regulation-without-representation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> failed socialist rules and regulations</a> from Brussels, responsible for bringing growth and innovation to a grinding halt. Even if the referendum had gone the other way, it should still have served as a wake-up call to the European Union&rsquo;s unelected bureaucratic dictators. Euroscepticism and populist movements are gathering momentum in EU countries from Italy to France to Sweden, and the week before last, fiercely independent Switzerland, which voted against joining the EU in the 1990s, finally yanked its membership application for good.American voters should be paying attention. Many have already pointed out the parallels between the Brexit movement and Donald Trump&rsquo;s populist campaign for president. This connection was not lost on Trump, who tweeted early Friday morning: &ldquo;They took their country back, just like we will take America back.&rdquo;##TRENDING##Britain&rsquo;s decision to leave exposes the fragility of trade right now and mounting apprehension toward globalization. The EU is mired in tepid growth, and the blame cannot be pinned on immigrants, as some have tried to do. Instead, Brussels&rsquo; policies are anti-growth. Moore&rsquo;s Law says the number of transistors in a microchip doubles every two years. That&rsquo;s just a fact.American entrepreneurs embrace and indeed push the limits of technological innovation, but &ldquo;Eurocrats,&rdquo; to a large extent, seem to be in open opposition to it. This is why many large, successful American tech firms such as Facebook and Google are treated with such hostility in Europe. The bureaucrats are so against growth and prosperity, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if they tried to do away with Moore&rsquo;s Law.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> A Legendary Day for Gold</h3>Immediately after results were announced, the British pound sterling, one of the world&rsquo;s reserve currencies, collapsed spectacularly against the dollar, plunging to levels not seen since Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s administration. The euro, the world&rsquo;s only fiat currency without a country, fell more than 2 percent.Gold, meanwhile, screamed past $1,300 an ounce to hit a two-year high, proving again that the yellow metal is sound money and fervently sought by investors worldwide as a safe haven during times of economic and political uncertainty.<img alt=\"\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Gold-and-British-Pound-Make-Huge-Moves-Following-Brexit-Referendum.png\" width=\"600\"/>Uncertainty is indeed the order of the day. As the World Gold Council (WGC) put it on Friday, &ldquo;It is difficult to find an event to compare this to.&rdquo; Trading blocs have fractured before, but none as large and significant as the EU. As the world&rsquo;s fourth most liquid currency, gold saw massive trading volumes. At the Shanghai Gold Exchange, an all-time record amount of gold was traded following the Brexit&mdash;the equivalent of 143 tonnes in all.&ldquo;We expect to see strong and sustained inflows into the gold market, driven by the intense market uncertainty that now faces the global markets,&rdquo; the WGC wrote.The Brexit lifted not just bullion but gold stocks as well, with many of them climbing to fresh highs. Shares of Barrick Gold shot up 10 percent in early-morning trading while Yamana Gold and Newmont Mining both saw gains of over 8 percent.I&rsquo;ve always advocated a 10 percent weighting in gold&mdash;5 percent in physical gold, 5 percent in gold stocks&mdash;with rebalancing done on a quarterly basis. Gold is now up at least one standard deviation for the 60-day period, meaning now might be a good time to take some profits and rebalance. It&rsquo;s been a spectacular six months!<h3> So What Happens Now?</h3>As I said, global growth is unstable, especially in the EU, and the Brexit will only add to the instability. This will likely continue to be the case in the short and intermediate terms as markets digest the implications of the U.K.&rsquo;s historic exit.It should be noted that the country will remain a member of the EU for two more years, during which time the nature of the relationship following the official divorce can be negotiated. These negotiations will take place without David Cameron, who unexpectedly announced early Friday morning that he was stepping down as prime minister.The results of the referendum also call into question the unity of the kingdom itself. England and Wales both voted to leave the European bloc while Scotland and Northern Ireland were aligned in their desire to remain members.<img alt=\"\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/A-House-Divided.png\" width=\"600\"/>Reacting to the outcome, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, said the people of Scotland see their future &ldquo;as part of the European Union.&rdquo; A second attempt at pulling out of the U.K., then, seems likely. In September 2014, you might remember, a referendum to quit the United Kingdom failed. Northern Ireland will become the only part of the U.K. to share a land border with an EU country (the Republic of Ireland), and it&rsquo;s unclear at the moment whether a physical border, complete with passport control checks, will need to be erected.In the meantime, it&rsquo;s important to &ldquo;keep calm and invest on.&rdquo; We should expect volatility in the short term, but the global selloff might be a good opportunity to nibble at stocks that could rally once the initial shock has subsided.For investors looking to minimize the volatility, short-term, tax-free municipal bonds continue to be attractive on global negative interest rates and falling currencies. Muni bond funds have seen inflows of more than $30 billion this year alone, with the week ended June 22 seeing the highest inflows in over three years at $1.4 billion.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-28 15:30:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-28 15:30:16.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_7NlOv5w.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/failed-socialism-whats-next-after-the-brexit-referendum/\", \"post_id\": \"12112\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-28 15:30:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-28 15:30:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"failed-socialism-whats-next-after-the-brexit-referendum\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12109\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5879\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Failed-Socialism-What\\u2019s-Next-After-the-Brexit-Referendum.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1015\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467198000,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;ve been working my butt off for the past two years and I keep getting passed over for promotions. I swear if I didn&rsquo;t know better I&rsquo;d say there was a giant conspiracy at my workplace to keep me from advancing. But I know that can&rsquo;t be it. What&rsquo;s worse is that during this time I&rsquo;ve seen so many less talented people get promotions, raises and teams of their own. It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating watching people I know aren&rsquo;t as smart as me, having success while I&rsquo;m stuck in career quicksand. What am I doing wrong? <br/>  </h3><p> A &ndash; I know this feeling. I know it so well in fact, I wrote an entire book about it. If you&rsquo;re really interested, check it out, if you&rsquo;re only kind of interested, let me give you some of the most important points right here in the blog. I&rsquo;m sure my publisher will want to kill me for that, but I get this question so much I just have to share my thoughts here.</p><p> If your career experience looks anything like mine, and it sounds like it does, you&rsquo;ve probably spent more time than you should wondering how certain people around you became so successful while you tread water. You can&rsquo;t help but look at some of the executives at your workplace and scratch your head. How did that guy make it? You cry a little bit each time one of your less talented LinkedIn contacts announces a promotion. Who are they sleeping with? You cringe as your Facebook timeline seemingly lights up with old high school friends making it big. Those guys weren&rsquo;t as smart as me! It's infuriating.</p><p> I spent ten years doing exactly this. Truly vexed at how less competent people around me seemed to get ahead with such ease, while I &ndash; Mr. Smarty Pants &ndash; seemed stuck in perpetual career stagnation. This is a byproduct of a phenomenon I call the Incompetent Executive: The average and below average managers who make it big. You know these people as well as I do. &lsquo;Teflon Executives&rsquo; a friend of mine calls them. No matter what happens, they always end up on top and yet they seemingly do nothing at all.</p><p> At first, I bemoaned the unfairness of it all and asked all the wrong questions (see above). But then one fateful day I stopped all that and started asking the right ones:</p><li> Why are they getting ahead and I am not?</li><li> What does it actually take to be successful in a corporation?</li><li>  Is being smarter really the smartest way to the top?</li><p> Once I started on this train of thought, everything changed for me.  I began to see corporate dynamics and career upward mobility in a completely new light. And when I did, some very disturbing evidence began to reveal itself. Many of qualities I cherished as my strong points were in actual fact the very attributes holding me back.</p><li> Passionate about my work and ideas</li><li> Hardworking to the point of exhaustion</li><li> Vocal and anxious to debate topics vigorously</li><li> Fixated on quarterly results</li><li> Demanding of my employees and co-workers</li><p> On the surface, these seem like great qualities and at one time I would have underscored them in my argument about the great injustice of it all. But if these attributes were so strong, how could I be stuck in middle management when these seemingly incompetent managers continued to rise up the ranks?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> So after many years of observation and analysis I handpicked the top seven tactics to manage your career the right way. I put these lessons into my own game plan and had immediate success. You can read about them in depth and with all kinds of fun stories in Stealing the Corner Office or you can read the summaries below and get the basic picture of what I've learned. These are lessons taken straight from the playbooks of executives who succeed in spite of their glaring lack of skill, work ethic and intelligence. The idea isn't to copy incompetent executives entirely, but rather to take a few lessons from the things they're actually doing well and apply them to your own game. When you combine these lessons with your natural talent and skill, I&rsquo;m confident your career will take a major turn for the better.</p><h3> The top seven tactics to manage your career the right way: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Embrace the Changes Everyone Else Hates <br/>  </h3><p> Because human beings are naturally opposed to change, the greatest moments for career advancement come in times of uncertainty and disruption. During these periods, like in an acquisition or management shake-up, the opportunities are at their greatest and your competition are at their worst. While your competitors are rebelling to change and worrying what the future may hold, you need to be executing your advancement strategy. Most of my promotions and big opportunities over the years have come during these times of change.</p><h3> 2. Don&rsquo;t be Part of the Herd <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s very comforting and often therapeutic to gripe and gossip with peers at work. We are naturally drawn to this behavior especially in times of change and uncertainty. You should never do it. We also tend to network with people at our own level or below in the company because it&rsquo;s comfortable and easy. It&rsquo;s a waste of time. To actually get ahead in a corporation you need to differentiate yourself from your competitors. Gravitating to the herd has the opposite effect. So if you find yourself engaging in a lot of group gossip behavior at work &ndash; whether you&rsquo;re talented or not - you should stop.</p><h3> 3. Never be Passionate about Your Ideas <br/>  </h3><p> Many of us have dreams of being transformative figures and we are drawn to icons like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg for their passion and perseverance. But for every Jobs there are hundreds of bodies lined up along the road that tried and failed to execute a passion-based strategy. In my experience a reputation for objectivity is much more useful than a reputation for passion. The only sure fire way to do that is to commit to providing very objective alternatives in every scenario rather than to drive at any one agenda or idea you may have. As great as your ideas may seem to you - &ldquo;You&rdquo; are irrelevant. Focus on helping your company evaluate ideas objectively and avoid passionate pursuits.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4. Avoid the Farce of Results Orientation <br/>  </h3><p> Despite what your manager tells you or what the career blogs may say, a myopic focus on short-term results can be a prison sentence for your career. We know from studying Incompetent Executives that it&rsquo;s much more productive to broaden your skill set than it is to fixate on short-term objectives. The challenge we face as managers is the burden of separating our own personal objectives i.e. career advancement, from the company&rsquo;s objective i.e. achieving performance results. Your career is much better served in the long run by expanding your expertise than by reliably delivering short-term results for the organization. This is one I get a lot of questions and comments on.</p><h3> 5. Find Big Problems to Solve <br/>  </h3><p> As it pertains to career advancement, small wins and reliable performance do not put a winning score on the board. It can take as many as five small victories to equal one big win. Managers who play a game based on reliability tend to become known only for their mistakes. Mistakes, unlike small wins, reverberate across the company and garner lots of attention. It makes much more sense to pursue a big win strategy even at the expense of making more small mistakes. Big wins are memorable, they build attention outside your department, and they often don&rsquo;t need to come at a high risk to you personally. My suggestion is to find a big project or challenge to take on whether its directly related to your core job responsibilities or not.</p><h3> 6. Learn to Promote Your Projects <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s very easy to fall into the trap of assuming your work speaks for itself. Especially when you&rsquo;re busy. As managers we so often prioritize the work and deprioritize internal promotion during crunch time. This is a recipe for career disaster. It makes the false assumption that people in your organization, especially those outside your department, actually define success the same way you do. Demonstrating to influencers in your company how your work will benefit them is much more important than the work itself. Doing so effectively can often make up for inferior work and act as an insurance policy for project failures. You need to be promoting projects before, during and after they execute to maximize visibility and minimize criticism.</p><h3> 7. Don&rsquo;t Hold People Accountable. Help Them <br/>  </h3><p> Holding people accountable is another modern career principle we&rsquo;ve allowed to spiral out of control. While it makes perfect sense why the corporate entity benefits from employees and managers holding each other accountable, it makes almost no sense for your own career advancement. In my experience, there is much more to be gained by being seen as a mentor than as a task master. In practice people gravitate to, hire and promote individuals they like to be around, not people who demand accountability. One of the best demonstrations of leadership qualities is to mentor others. Next time you feel like killing your colleague for his crappy work, help him instead.</p><p> I can tell from your question that you&rsquo;re in a very similar place to where I was for the first fifteen years of my career. No doubt you find yourself getting more frustrated with every passing year. You can&rsquo;t seem to get ahead in spite of your hard work and talent. You see other people having success, often times in spite of glaring incompetence. You probably spend a lot of time wondering about the injustice of it all. I hope you can take these 7 lessons and apply them to your game plan and see things get better. Let me know how it goes for you.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-28 15:49:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-28 15:49:23.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_3bLadfE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/find-big-problems-to-solve-7-ways-to-get-that-big-promotion/\", \"post_id\": \"12114\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-28 15:49:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-28 15:49:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"find-big-problems-to-solve-7-ways-to-get-that-big-promotion\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12113\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5880\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Find-Big-Problems-to-Solve-7-Ways-to-Get-That-Big-Promotion.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"709\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467226800,"author_id":74,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5650,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Advisors Should Rethink the Process of Collecting Fees","link":"how-advisors-should-rethink-the-process-of-collecting-fees","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Who made the rule that advisers only get paid after the work has been done? <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s likely a hangover from commission days. Here&rsquo;s why you should consider changing. </p><li> Lag. Ever since FSRA, the work required to onboard a client has sky rocketed. In many cases, there's now 3-6 month lag between starting and getting paid. That&rsquo;s a pretty big cashflow credit your firm has to bankroll.</li><li> To rush or not to rush? No one needs the added challenge of rushing through advice to serve a commercial requirement. Anyway, why does holistic advice need to be given as one chunk? If there&rsquo;s complexity, surely it makes more sense to stage the advice out?</li><li> Skin in the game. There are two decisions a client needs to make. One is the moment they say yes, the second is when payment time arrives. The second is the real decision. Plus, clients can be more motivated if they know the meter is running.</li><p> In such cases, it makes sense to look at alternatives, and I&rsquo;ve got five for you.  <br/> <br/> First though, let me address those out there with the view &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work because clients want to see the value first&rdquo;.  <br/> <br/> My message is: If you&rsquo;re unable to show value in your first appointment without delivering advice, then you're doing it the hard way. It's not about the information.  <br/> <br/> In any case, advisers are already doing it this way. One adviser I know recently increased the price of his cashflow coaching offer from $200pm to $400pm and his new clients didn&rsquo;t blink. He&rsquo;s still getting amazing emails through talking about how happy they are to have finally got a handle on things. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> It&rsquo;s not about the price, it&rsquo;s about the value. If you&rsquo;ve uncovered the value and are starting work, why shouldn&rsquo;t the client start paying?  <br/> <br/> Then you can be assured that they know that every time you ask for data, require them to come back to you or need them to engage, there's a financial motivator too.  <br/> <br/> It&rsquo;s as much about their requirement to partner with you as it is for you to deliver. Exactly as it should be.  <br/> <br/> So, if you&rsquo;re looking for a way to charge from the outset, here are five ideas to reshape your pricing. </p><h3> 1. Flat monthly fee from day one <br/>  </h3><p> Start fees from the moment you start work, and forget about an upfront \"spike\" altogether. Work out your set amount, price it well and make a call whether to accept a lesser profit margin during the set-up period in favour of recouping in later years. The caveat here is you need to be confident your business has the ongoing service model to retain clients. </p><h3> 2. Upfront fee then flat monthly from day one <br/>  </h3><p> Same idea of monthly fees, with the additional big payment to become a client. This model is likely to work most effectively with clients with clear financial issues and complexity that needs to be dealt with. This is also a good way to ensure that once onboard, they're unlikely to want to see that upfront investment go to waste. </p><h3> 3. Staggered payment <br/>  </h3><p> The midpoint between the two above is again a stable monthly payment from day one, but with the first 3-6 months payments loaded with an amount equivalent to your engagement fee. It's a good way of getting the benefit of an upfront fee without the quantum presenting an issue. Again, it also provides an incentive to persist. </p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4. Flat monthly with plan fee at the time plan is delivered <br/>  </h3><p> The most promising model for those keen to deliver holistic advice, but aware that not all clients want to solve all problems at once. It enables a business to address each component of advice over time (e.g. insurance in the first three months, followed by cashflow, perhaps not even touching upon investments until year two or beyond). </p><h3> 5. Full payment <br/>  </h3><p> Of course, depending on the client&rsquo;s circumstances, an option may be simply to invoice the client in one chunk for year one, spreading it over a few months if needed, before revisiting the arrangement at review for year two. A clear benefit of this arrangement of less than 12 months is it&rsquo;s potentially exempt from FDS or Opt-in. Convenient, but you'd want to be sure of your ongoing value, as it's essentially a very clear decision conversation each year.  <br/> <br/> Either way, in this time of digitally influenced procrastination and the many administration challenges faced by advice firms, debtor days and cash flow are an additional problem many don't need.  <br/> <br/> Changing your thinking on collecting fees might just be one avenue to make life a little simpler. </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-28 16:24:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-28 16:24:28.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_c1X7nfF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-advisors-should-rethink-the-process-of-collecting-fees/\", \"post_id\": \"12116\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-28 16:24:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-28 16:24:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-advisors-should-rethink-the-process-of-collecting-fees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12115\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5881\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-Advisors-Should-Rethink-the-Process-of-Collecting-Fees.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"824\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467194400,"author_id":456,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5651,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Putting Brexit in Perspective After the Predictable Reaction","link":"putting-brexit-in-perspective-after-the-predictable-reaction","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The news was big last week. The British cast their votes, and the outcome was what many had feared&mdash;especially David Cameron who resigned in the wake of the historic Brexit vote. He said he will stay to &ldquo;steady the ship,&rdquo; but this ship needs some smart hands on deck to safely escape this storm.</p><p> The reaction in the US is much more predictable. Global uncertainty never bodes well for stock prices, and that proved true at the opening bell this morning. And yet, at least as I write this morning, the Dow index or (&ldquo;the market&rdquo;), is still down less than 3%. To put that statistic in context, just six months ago the market dipped more than 3% in a single day. Since then, we&rsquo;ve seen a step-by-step recovery. It hasn&rsquo;t been a smooth upward climb, but even in its volatility, the market has continued to grow at a slow and steady pace.</p><p> There&rsquo;s intense analysis happening at the moment regarding the implications of Britain leaving the European Union, but in reality, only time will tell. What may be most important to remember from a financial perepective is that time is what matters most. It will take time&mdash;months or even years&mdash;for the situation to play out economically and politically. As an investor, it&rsquo;s important not to react to the news. While it&rsquo;s normal to feel unsettled when the market falls, fear is your biggest risk when it comes to long-term financial success.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important to know:</p><li> Keep your seatbelt fastened. The market has given us all a bumpy ride for years now. While we&rsquo;re nowhere near the Dow&rsquo;s 15,000 level we saw just last year, the uncertainty overseas is sure to continue to shake things up&mdash;just as China did last year, and oil prices did in Q1 of this year. The US election in November may also have an impact on market indices. Just be prepared.</li><li> Despite what&rsquo;s happening in the UK and Europe, the US economy is gaining strength. US earnings are solid, employment is up, and there are no indicators of a pending slide. As long as US consumers continue to gain confidence, this should not change.</li><li> Interest rates are likely to remain low. In the wake of the Brexit, the odds are low that the Fed will opt to raise interest rates anytime soon.</li><li> Stocks are on sale. Today&rsquo;s stock prices have no relationship to the underlying value of the companies they represent, and our portfolios are built on strong companies with growth momentum. If you still have time on your side from an investment perspective, now is the time to purchase stocks&mdash;not run from them.</li><li> If you&rsquo;re taking distributions, sit tight. Retirees are often the most fearful in a downturn. And while fear may spur some to pull out of the market, that&rsquo;s the best way to ensure an immediate loss.

How can your LinkedIn profile be enough for you to be found faster in LinkedIn and Google Searches? </p><p> It can&rsquo;t and will never be enough; however, optimizing your profile does help tremendously for 2 reasons &ndash; 1. search engine optimization and 2. your first impression. Search Engine Optimization is the key your digital footprint being found, correct? And last year, social media profiles became more weighted in Google searches than anything else, unless you have a felony on your record!</p><p> What does that mean? Google your name. What do you see first? That&rsquo;s right. Your social media profiles. Your LinkedIn profile. And what does that mean? Your digital footprint, including your LinkedIn profile, contributes to the first impression in which many prospects, future business partners, and hiring managers are influenced. </p><p> Your LinkedIn profile is not only important from a search engine optimization point-of-view, but also as a first impression in many instances. Don&rsquo;t you think it makes sense to put your best foot forward in every possible situation?</p><p> One of the most crucial sections of your LinkedIn profile is the one section that receives the most negative feedback, in my opinion &ndash; the &lsquo;Skills&rsquo; section. More often than not, I hear the following reasons for the hatred:</p><li> People are endorsing me for things that I never listed as a skill</li><li> People I don&rsquo;t even know are endorsing me for skills</li><li> I just endorse people when LinkedIn tells me to &ndash; you know... that blue box that appears at the top of my LinkedIn profile whenever I log in, asking me if my 1st-degree connections have specific skills.</li><p> Would it surprise you if I told you that you have complete control over each and every single one of these scenarios? </p><h3> Scenario 1: People are endorsing me for things that I never listed as a skill <br/>  </h3><p> Take control by filling in your 50 skills. If all of the slots for skills are filled, you can&rsquo;t intentionally or accidentally add the suggested skill to your profile without removing one skill to add the new skill.</p><h3> Scenario 2: People I don&rsquo;t even know are endorsing me for skills <br/>  </h3><p> Take away the option for your &lsquo;skills recommendation&rsquo; box to populate for your 1st-degree connections. You know &ndash; that blue box that appears at the top of everyone&rsquo;s profile when they log in to LinkedIn, asking them to endorse you for skills that may or may not be your legitimate skillset. It may also be helpful to know that only your 1st-degree connections can endorse you for skills listed on your profile. If people you don&rsquo;t know are endorsing you, then perhaps it&rsquo;s the perfect reason to reach out and open a dialogue.</p><h3> Scenario 3: I just endorse people when LinkedIn tells me to <br/>  </h3><p> First of all &ndash; stop that.  You&rsquo;re not a bot.  Be purposeful in your actions.  Always.  Your actions should have meaning and purpose behind them.  Don&rsquo;t behave differently just because it&rsquo;s easy.  Also, you can turn off that blue box that continues to suggest endorsements for skills for your 1st degree connections.  Perhaps turning it off will change your approach to endorsing your connections.  Perhaps having to take the time to go to their LinkedIn Profile to endorse your connections for specific skills, will help you add value to your connections, instead of adding frustration.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-28 16:39:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-28 16:39:58.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_Ve7RsIM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-most-hated-section-on-your-linkedin-profile/\", \"post_id\": \"12120\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-28 16:39:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-28 16:39:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-most-hated-section-on-your-linkedin-profile\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12119\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5883\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Most-Hated-Section-on-Your-LinkedIn-Profile.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"896\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467223200,"author_id":68,"chart_url":""}

Before that, she had been the General Counsel for one of the largest companies in the world. It&rsquo;s a powerful and important position.</p><p> For most, it would be the crowning achievement of an extraordinary career. Because of this, Catherine has what they call &ldquo;street cred&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the credibility that only comes from having had to live by your wits in the rough-and-tumble real world of business.</p><p> One day I had breakfast with Catherine, and I decided to get some free counsel. Not about legal matters&mdash;about relationships.</p><p> &ldquo;Catherine,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious. As a senior partner, you are trying to build relationships with in-house counsel at large companies and sell your legal services to them. But just a few years ago you were the General Counsel. You hired lawyers and law firms all over the world.&rdquo; I paused. &ldquo;So tell me&mdash;what it&rsquo;s like being on the other side of the desk?&rdquo;</p><p> Catherine stopped eating. She shifted her gaze away from her scrambled eggs to me. I think I saw a glint in her eyes.</p><p> &ldquo;Before I got promoted, I was the Deputy General Counsel at my company. But even though it was a very important position, the outside law firms we worked with&mdash;and other types of consultants&mdash;always wanted to talk to my boss, the General Counsel. They often tried to bypass me. They thought he made all the decisions, and they invested everything in their relationship with him. They treated me more like a gatekeeper.&rdquo;</p><p> I could see where this was going!</p><p> She continued: &ldquo;On the day the announcement of my promotion to General Counsel hit the newspapers, my office was flooded with calls from big law firms all over the country. They all wanted to talk to me. They coveted my business. All of a sudden I was very popular. So do you know what I said to all those blue-chip law firm partners who called me that day? The ones who never bothered to build a relationship with me?&rdquo; She paused. You could hear a pin drop at our table. &ldquo;I politely asked each one of them, &lsquo;Where were you five years ago?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> Bam!</p><p> Many professionals ask me, &ldquo;How can I build more relationships with CEOs and other top executives?&rdquo; The best answer is this principle: Follow the person, not the position. Build relationships with smart, motivated, interesting, and ambitious people, even if they&rsquo;re not in an important job right now. Follow them throughout their careers.</p><p> You see, really important people&mdash;those who are the top of their careers in any field&mdash;have brought their advisors along with them over many years. While it is not impossible to break into someone&rsquo;s inner circle after they have achieved great success, it&rsquo;s also not an easy task.</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re 20 or 50, you know interesting people who are going places. Follow them, stay in touch with them, and cultivate your relationship with them over many years. The fruits will be enormous. Not only will they help your career, but&mdash;perhaps more important&mdash;you will have an indelible impact on their success as well.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Don&rsquo;t just focus on connecting with top executives or other successful people at the peak of their careers. Go for the bright ones on the rise.</p><p> As a side benefit&mdash;before you know it&mdash;you&rsquo;ll also end up knowing a sprinkling of very important people in high positions. And when this happens, the relationship will be very different than if you are a latecomer. You will share history together. You&rsquo;ll be relaxed around each other. You will be treated like the old friend you are.</p><p> Follow the person, not the position. Make a list of 12 to 15 people you know who are not yet at the peak of their success or position. Pick passionate, motivated, talented individuals. Ascertain what their top 3-5 goals and priorities are. Knowing these, decide how you can best add value in the relationship. Then, stay in touch with these individuals regularly over time.</p><p> What&rsquo;s the best way to meet CEOs?

{"original_id":5654,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Following These 4 Financial Habits to Achieve Your Goals?","link":"are-you-following-these-4-financial-habits-to-achieve-your-goals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Our habits play a crucial role in our ability to meet our goals and become who we want to be. Bad habits &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s biting our nails, overeating, smoking or something else &mdash; create roadblocks on the path to becoming our best selves.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s no different when it comes to our finances. Bad money habits can have damaging, long-term consequences for our financial security. But developing healthy financial habits can do wonders for helping us achieve our long-term goals like saving enough for retirement or paying for a child&rsquo;s college education.</p><p> The earlier you develop healthy financial habits, the better your chances of successfully meeting your goals. Here are four financial habits you should start working on today:</p><h3> 1. Separate spending on &lsquo;needs&rsquo; and &lsquo;wants&rsquo; <br/>  </h3><p> This is the first step in developing healthy habits. You need to understand where your money is going and then figure out where you need to allocate it to make the best use of it.</p><p> Sticking to a spending plan and avoiding impulse buying is crucial for building a healthy savings plan. Create a simple budget that shows you how much money you are bringing in and helps you understand your monthly spending. Add up all of your expenses that you would consider a need &mdash; this includes your monthly savings amount, rent, car payment, cable and internet bill, food, etc. (By including your savings amount in your need category, you create an automatic savings plan for yourself &mdash; more on that below.) Subtract that total from your income, and what is left over is your free cash flow.</p><p> The remaining money is the amount you have at your disposal for your &ldquo;want&rdquo; expenses. At the very least, make sure you are not spending more than that. At the end of the month, if you still have money left over, stick it in your savings or investment account. This removes the temptation to spend it and lets you start the next month fresh again. If you consistently have money left over, increase your savings amount.</p><h3> 2. Set up automatic savings <br/>  </h3><p> Creating a consistent savings mechanism will ensure you are saving a minimum amount each month or paycheck, making progress toward your longer-term goals. Whether you are saving into an investment account or your bank savings account, set up an automatic contribution from each of your paychecks so that the money is &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; and you won&rsquo;t be tempted to spend it.</p><p> Why is this so important? Without having an automatic savings plan, you could be saving $500 one month and then $0 the next. Although this is better than not saving at all, it is not a good practice to adopt. And remember, you can start small. Even if it&rsquo;s $100 a month, saving consistently will pay off immensely down the road. </p><h3> 3. Participate in your employer-sponsored retirement plan <br/>  </h3><p> Saving for retirement is one of the most important financial habits you can build for yourself. The power of tax-deferred investment growth over your entire career can really add up. Another benefit with 401(k)s and other retirement plans is that the money you contribute is pretax, which effectively lowers your taxable income, reducing your tax liability today.</p><p> If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k) based on your contribution level, it&rsquo;s especially important to contribute enough to take advantage of this benefit. The employer is basically offering you free money that you would be turning down. For instance, an employer may offer a retirement savings plan to which you can contribute up to 5% of your salary and it will match up to 3% of that. If you don&rsquo;t contribute at least 3%, you are in effect saying no to a 3% raise.</p><p> If your employer does not offer a retirement savings plan, look into opening a self-directed retirement account such as an IRA so you can benefit from tax-advantaged retirement saving.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Start investing now <br/>  </h3><p> Time is the greatest advantage investors have when it comes to saving and investing early and consistently. With the power of compound interest, even small amounts can really add up over the years. With compound interest, your interest amount is added to the principal, increasing the amount of interest you earn, even if the rate of return does not change. To take advantage of compound interest, the earlier you start saving, the better.</p><p> If you can boost your savings rate, you&rsquo;ll be even better off in the event of a long period of low investment returns, according to Michael Batnick, director of research for investment firm Ritholtz Wealth Management. &ldquo;Saving more money can offset lower returns because you&rsquo;re compounding on top of compounding,&rdquo; Batnick writes. He points to a comparison of two portfolios over a 20-year period, both starting with contributions of $5,000 a year. The portfolio earning an average of 4% annually, with contributions increased by 10% each year, will have $100,000 more in it compared with a portfolio earning 6% a year, with contributions raised by only 5% ($393,153 vs. $293,534).</p><h3> Prioritize your goals <br/>  </h3><p> If you already have these good financial habits, that&rsquo;s great. If not, the best time to start developing them is now. Everyone will have their own goals and needs, and, unfortunately, not all of those can be satisfied at the same time. You&rsquo;ll have to prioritize your goals, but once you do, you can start building healthy habits that will allow you to reach them. Separating your needs from your wants, saving early and often, taking advantage of tax-favored retirement savings plans, and investing now can help you build a solid financial foundation and get you where you want to go.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-28 16:59:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-28 16:59:21.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_sWcasnZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-following-these-4-financial-habits-to-achieve-your-goals/\", \"post_id\": \"12124\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-28 16:59:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-28 16:59:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-following-these-4-financial-habits-to-achieve-your-goals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12123\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5885\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-You-Following-These-4-Financial-Habits-to-Achieve-Your-Goals.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"664\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467194400,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

For some leaders in sales their focus is about sharing the benefits and advantages of their product or service. They can&rsquo;t wait to espouse the amazing attributes of what they are selling and jump in right away with that conversation. But these two pharmaceutical sales reps looked at their mission very differently.</p><p> &ldquo;What a great team of sales reps we have!&rdquo; one said. &ldquo;I feel so lucky to have a manager who cares and sees my value.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;When I approach doctors I never talk business or drugs at first. I ask them how things are going in both their personal and professional worlds&rdquo;, said another.</p><p> &ldquo;When I bump into my customers at the gym I would never intrude on their personal time. Believe me, the last thing they want to do is talk shop when they are in their personal zone.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;By the time I speak to them about the pharmaceutical products, I have developed a strong connection with them. And believe me, they are not writing prescriptions because of the items I am selling. They do it because of my relationship with them.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Have you thought about the way you influence and work with others? Do you spend time initially cultivating a meaningful connection before asking for someone&rsquo;s help or selling a service or product?</p><h3> Have you tried these five tactics to build deeper relationships with team members and customers? <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. NEVER START WITH THE SALE <br/>  </h3><p> Just like the two leaders I mentioned, it is your number one mission to establish a deeper connection with someone before earning their sale or trust. Although we might feel there isn&rsquo;t enough time to develop a spark, the truth is that if we begin our conversations with, &ldquo;Let me tell you all about why you need my service or product&rdquo;, we are doomed. Stop yourself and say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the relationship&rdquo;!</p><h3> 2. BE CURIOUS ABOUT CO-WORKERS AND CUSTOMERS <br/>  </h3><p> The best strategy to developing customer relationships is having a curiosity about what brings them happiness or joy or frustration. Think of team members and customers as complete human beings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the relationship.&rdquo;</p><li> Find out where they spend time outside of work</li><li> Discover what may be their favorite sports or teams</li><li> Identify some foods you may have in common</li><li> Try to understand the type of people they are and what drives them</li><h3> 3. OFFER TO FIND SOLUTIONS <br/>  </h3><p> Once we get to know our colleagues and customers better, help them define their challenges more clearly. Empower them to see that although they may be experiencing hardships, you can offer some helpful solutions. If we have built the relationship and a level of trust, they will be more likely to listen to our guidance and ideas. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the relationship.&rdquo;</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4. BE VULNERABLE BY SHARING YOUR STORY <br/>  </h3><p> One of the pharmaceutical sales reps is a veteran and develops connections with his customers through his storytelling of his tour duties. When he shares this most personal part of his life, the doctors form deeper relationships with him. He displays his authentic self and they begin to as well. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the relationship.&rdquo;</p><h3> 5. STAY OPEN TO DIFFERFENCES <br/>  </h3><p> Not all of our co-workers or customers see challenges through our same lens. That means, we need to keep a wider view of how to approach solutions. If we try to resolve an issue for another that merely works for us, it may miss the mark for our customer. Meet them wherever they are. If a team member is looking to enrich their job, ask them to be part of projects that will help them grow. If a customer is focused on a particular issue, focus on resolving that challenge and don&rsquo;t suggest alternative concerns. Listen and take action to real concerns. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the relationship.&rdquo;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-28 17:16:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-28 17:16:05.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_6RB3DRi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/its-all-about-the-relationship-five-tactics-to-becoming-a-better-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"12126\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-28 17:16:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-28 17:16:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"its-all-about-the-relationship-five-tactics-to-becoming-a-better-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12125\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5886\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Its-All-About-the-Relationship-Five-Tactics-to-Becoming-a-Better-Leader.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"604\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467216000,"author_id":476,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5656,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Analyzing Why SPEED in an Important Social Media Customer Service","link":"analyzing-why-speed-in-an-important-social-media-customer-service","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We manage the social media accounts for many brands; Hotels that are open 24/7, consumer food products that are consumed 24/7 and many businesses that are not open 24/7 but whose customers and fans are online 24/7, and then there is our own brand that is not 24/7 but often feels like it.</p><p> In the digital age we live in, our brand is open as long as there are consumers crawling around on our social channels and websites. It&rsquo;s like they have keys to our front doors, even when we aren&rsquo;t there. How quickly we are able to respond to a comment or question our customers leave can create a lasting impression&hellip;good or bad.</p><p> There is something very endearing about a brand that can respond quickly when you mention them in a tweet or post somewhere else. You feel validated and special! It is certainly no easy task to run a listening command center for your brand, but even the smallest of companies can benefit greatly from becoming faster on the draw when it comes to response time.</p><p> To manage the ever-growing online population, your company must have a plan on how to stay fast as well as maintain a high-level of customer service on social media. There are 2.1 million negative social mentions about brands in the US alone, according to a study done by Venture Beat. A full ten percent of us find something to complain about publicly, every day, and the sad fact is most of these complaints fall on deaf ears. A whopping 32.8 percent of the complaints go completely ignored.</p><p> Last week we had a consumer post a photo of a food product that had mold on it on the client&rsquo;s Facebook page. It was 7pm. Our policy with this client was to notify them via phone before we responded to any negative comment. We already had an apology response crafted and ready to at least let the customer know they have been heard and we are working on a solution. The client was worried and wanted the legal department to give their input (yes this brand was new to social media), so we waited&hellip;and waited&hellip;and waited. We couldn&rsquo;t even send the message letting the person know they had been heard.</p><p> The consumer, however, did not wait. They started tagging their friends, after 30 minutes, telling them not to purchase the product because it was bad, and a conversation blossomed &hellip; without us!</p><p> When a consumer posts a positive comment, they may not always expect to hear back right away from you to thank them for their wonderful comments, but when an angry person posts a question or comment, the timer starts ticking! Every moment counts. If you have to contact a manager to alert them of the situation, then draft a response to the person, send it to the manager, who has to send it to the legal team to approve it before you can say anything to the person online, you will have a much bigger problem, guaranteed.</p><p> The bottom line is speed and empathy when it comes to responding to a negative comment on social media. So how can you put systems and processes in place to help you respond faster to good and not so good comments on social?</p><h3> Here are 3 tips to get you started: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Be sure you go and grab your name on all social channels, whether you will use them or not. <br/>  </h3><p> This can get you into trouble if someone else can post as you. You also want to be able to quickly reply on the most popular channels, whether you use it for marketing or not. We have clients who insist that their audience is not on Twitter, and they don&rsquo;t see the need to be active there, but Twitter is one of the top social platforms for venting and it should be used as a listening tool, if for nothing else. You want to be notified and able to respond quickly on any social platform.</p><h3> 2. Have a written plan <br/>  </h3><p> Who will be contacted and how? Is there a different person to contact after normal business hours? Will you have a standard quick reply and then have a team of people or at least another person to help craft a more personalized answer? Having at least one other person involved will minimize the risk of someone responding defensively and inappropriately. If you are a solopreneur, a written plan will help you prevent a disaster if you get into a situation where you want to blast an angry response back or even when posting a heartfelt response that can get misinterpreted.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 3. Plan some response templates <br/>  </h3><p> There are certain common complaints any brand can anticipate whether you are a small fitness studio, a popular dairy company, or a large hotel chain, come up with a list of most likely complaints you might run across and then craft responses to each. These can be saved as drafts in Facebook or if you use a tool like Hootsuite, you can save them in your content library.</p><p> Be sure to look at your response times and your current process on a regular basis to find ways you can improve. With more eyeballs on our brands than ever before, we need to shine even brighter online when it comes to our level of customer service.</p><p> We&rsquo;d love to hear from you. What do you do to prepare or to respond faster to customers on your social channels?

{"original_id":5657,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Ready to Take on Next Gen Clients? A Robosaving Strategy May Be the Key","link":"ready-to-take-on-next-gen-clients-a-robosaving-strategy-may-be-the-key","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A lot of advisors talk about the desire to bring on next-generation clients. What&rsquo;s fascinating is that the discussion almost always focuses on how to manage the relationship after a parent dies. <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150713/FEATURE/150719999/the-great-wealth-transfer-is-coming-putting-advisers-at-risk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Investment News </a> recently reported that 66% of adult children fire their parents&rsquo; advisor after receiving an inheritance. And while that statistic does illustrate the problem, when it comes to attracting Millennials in the first place, it may be best to begin where this younger generation is at the moment: at the beginning.</p><p> The fact is, few Millennials have significant assets to invest&mdash;yet. Although the oldest of the group are busy celebrating their 35 th birthdays, 26% of Millennials are still living with their parents according to <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/07/29/more-millennials-living-with-family-despite-improved-job-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Pew Research Center </a> . The reasons are many, from a highly competitive job market to unprecedented student debt. Regardless, what Millennials need now is help accumulating enough assets to not only move out of Mom&rsquo;s basement, but to start investing in their futures. By filling that need, you can provide a much-needed service to the next generation and assist your existing clients by helping their kids gain stronger financial footing. Ultimately, you&rsquo;ll earn the business of tomorrow&rsquo;s breadwinners&mdash;even before they inherit Mom and Dad&rsquo;s wealth.</p><p> One way to tackle this objective is to build a new service offering that leverages Robo technology and helps Millennials start saving for the future. Whether you revere or detest them, Robo platforms are proving their worth as a low-cost alternative to comprehensive investment management. And while some advisors may still view Robos as a threat, those who are combining human intelligence with the latest technology platforms are already finding an edge. Using them to help Millennials start a serious savings plan can be a great first step.</p><h3> Saving begins with spending visibility</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s amazing what a little visibility will do to open people&rsquo;s eyes to how much they spend&mdash;and on what. I&rsquo;m a long-time disciple of <a href=\"http://www.quicken.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Quicken </a> . It&rsquo;s the best tool I know to track and analyze spending, and I vividly remember the first time I rolled up the numbers to see how much my wife and I were spending on eating out. It was stunning. And while it hasn&rsquo;t stopped us from occasionally going out for a good dinner, it has made us think twice when we&rsquo;re considering a splurge. For Millennials, that type of insight can be a life-changing wake up call.</p><p> Picture this: Tim is 28 and still sleeping in his boyhood bedroom, complete with <a href=\"http://www.nickelback.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nickelback </a> posters and his high school yearbook on the shelf. He wants to get out on his own, but he also knows he&rsquo;s sitting on $25K in student loan debt. After working as an unpaid intern for two years after college, he&rsquo;s finally working full time, but he&rsquo;s only pulling in $35K a year. After health insurance, car insurance, taxes, and his student loan payments, he feels like he can barely make ends meet&mdash;and that&rsquo;s without the burden of rent or a mortgage. Forget about contributing to his company&rsquo;s 401(k). The future is a long way off.</p><p> When you sit down with Tim&rsquo;s (very frustrated) parents for their annual review, his situation is one of the first things on their minds. Luckily, you have the ideal solution at the ready. You invite Tim to come in for a 30-minute meeting to talk about improving his finances. All he needs to bring with him is a record of his spending over the past two months.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Once he&rsquo;s there, you show him how to use Quicken (or one of several other good tools out there), including how to set up spending alerts that are delivered straight to his mobile device, as well as automated bank reconciliation and easy-to-use reporting tools. When Tim sees how easily these tools work with popular apps like PayPal, Venmo, and his bank&rsquo;s mobile banking app, he&rsquo;s thrilled.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Next you upload Tim&rsquo;s financial information on the spot and run a quick report. The graphic Tim sees next blows him away. Because here&rsquo;s the thing about Millennials like him: they&rsquo;re averse to owning things, they value convenience (sometimes above all), and they&rsquo;re susceptible to an aggressive marketing revolution that targets them where they spend most of their time: online. It&rsquo;s a costly reality.</p><p> In fact, if Tim is like most people his age, his top expenditure isn&rsquo;t his student loan payment, and the monthly costs of his stay-at-home lifestyle aren&rsquo;t so cost-effective after all. Restaurants dominate his spending, including everything from fast food to high-end &ldquo;date&rdquo; restaurants to a good number of $7 pints with his buddies. Uber, cell phone, and Starbucks all top the $100/month mark. And new technology is a given&mdash;from the iWatch to a bigger, better gaming computer. At a bird&rsquo;s-eye-view, even Tim can see that his financial habits are quickly sucking his independence out of him.</p><p> Tim may not have his financial ducks in a row, but when he sees the numbers, he knows things need to change. So you offer a low-cost service that includes some basic goal setting, creating a simple budget, and a quarterly review of his spending to help him stay on track. His job is to continuously update the app and work toward his budget. Your job is to encourage Tim to save as much as he can now, and continue to provide financial education so he knows how to leverage his savings when he has accumulated enough to start investing.</p><p> In a year, you&rsquo;ll likely have a much more confident Next Gen client with a bit of savings in the bank. In five years, you&rsquo;ll likely have Tim as an investment planning client with limited but growing assets. In 15 years, Tim and his fellow Millennials will likely be the core of your practice&mdash;and his parents&rsquo; assets are almost certain to rem ain a valuable piece of your book of business. All with just a little help from a Robo app&hellip;and a smart, low-cost customer acquisition strategy of helping Millennials build their wealth from the ground up.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-28 17:40:42.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-28 17:40:42.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_n5wPdCH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ready-to-take-on-next-gen-clients-a-robosaving-strategy-may-be-the-key/\", \"post_id\": \"12130\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-28 17:40:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-28 17:40:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ready-to-take-on-next-gen-clients-a-robosaving-strategy-may-be-the-key\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12129\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5888\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ready-to-Take-on-Next-Gen-Clients-A-Robosaving-Strategy-May-Be-the-Key.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"923\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467187200,"author_id":60,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5658,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Two Great Reasons Advisors Stay In Their Businesses","link":"two-great-reasons-advisors-stay-in-their-businesses","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Last week we listed  <a href=\"/strategies/exit-planning/eleven-reasons-advisors-dont-have-a-succession-plan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  eleven reasons </a>  that owners make that cause them to delay or avoid planning for their business exits. Rather than jump into explaining how to counter all those, instead we begin with two reasons owners tell us they want to stay active in their companies.Recall that Exit Planning is founded on a basic premise: <strong>  Unless a business exit gives owners and their families financial security (as they define it for the duration of their post-exit lives), and the ability to meet all of their other exit objectives, that exit is a train wreck. We call this &ldquo;owner-centric&rdquo; planning. </strong></p><h3> Reason To Stay #1: Return Outweighs The Risk</h3>As a reason for staying, this one is easy for both owners and all stakeholders (spouses, advisors, co-owners, etc.) to understand. Put simply, some owners have<li> Observed the volatility in today&rsquo;s stock market</li><li> Learned painful lessons from the 2008 market crash and</li><li> Realized that a low-risk investment-the U.S. ten-year bond is yielding less than two percent.</li>These owners rightly conclude that the income they currently receive from their businesses is much greater than they can earn from any other source. Further, owners in this camp anticipate that their businesses can generate more dependable returns than stock and bond markets.<h3> Reason To Stay #2:  &ldquo;I Love What I Do.&rdquo;</h3>Some owners stay in their businesses past the point they could successfully sell them because they find running their companies to be more meaningful than anything they could do outside of the business. They may be long in the tooth, their refusal to exit may stymie business growth or frustrate management or business active children, but at the end of the day the decision to exit, including the timing of that exit is the owner&rsquo;s, not ours as the advisor even if we think it is in our client&rsquo;s best interest.We&rsquo;ve found that when owners are pushed, or even pulled, into exiting before they are ready, the results are rarely positive and sometimes downright scary as a BEI member recounts.During our annual year-end planning meeting, one of my clients mentioned that he was approached by would-be buyers on a monthly basis. His wife and children were eager for him to sell. We had already started improving the company&rsquo;s value drivers and had documented the value of the company, but he wanted to start building a marketing strategy to sell the company and interviewing transaction intermediaries to orchestrate the sale.Within six months, we had put the company on the market, and several buyers had submitted offers in excess of my client&rsquo;s financial security goal of $4 million. This kicked off a bidding war. The buyers pushed their bids from $4M, to $6M, and then to $9M and $11M.At that point, the business owner disappeared. I don&rsquo;t mean that he stopped returning phone calls or responding to emails. I mean that no one&mdash;friends, family or colleagues&mdash;could locate him for days.After much worry about his welfare, and some concern about how long the $11M offer would stay open, the owner reappeared. We were all relieved that he was alive and well, but I had to warn him that he was dangerously close to blowing the deal of a lifetime. This owner&rsquo;s response took my breath away. &ldquo;Call off the deal. I&rsquo;ve thought long and hard about this and I don&rsquo;t want to sell. I have no idea what I&rsquo;d do with myself if I didn&rsquo;t have my company.&rdquo; I called my client&rsquo;s investment banker and had him withdraw from the transaction.##TRENDING##The saving grace for this owner (if there was one) is that he realized before the sale closed that he would be lost without the business. Pulling the plug on the sale process cost tens of thousands of dollars in fees and lost productivity, but much costlier was the emotional devastation the owner caused his family and himself.  The lesson, however, is one worth learning: If owners feel conflicted between staying and leaving, if they love what they are doing, it is NOT THE RIGHT TIME for us to encourage them to exit their companies.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> It Is Okay To Stay.</h3>Not encouraging an owner to exit before he or she is ready to exit is very different from not encouraging them to begin planning their inevitable exit. Exit Planners can lay out the many benefits of planning and highlight how goodExit Planning gives owners options. Most importantly Exit Planning advisors help owners understand that they can stay active while continuing to grow the company&rsquo;s cash flow and value. From an emotional readiness standpoint owners can carve out time to explore non-business activities should they change their minds about exiting.One owner we worked with only changed his mind about leaving after he found an activity that engaged him. Jorge (we&rsquo;ve changed his name, of course) owned a family-run automotive business. He was not opposed to transferring ownership to his two business-active children, but would not cut his workweek to less than sixty hours. This presented a real obstacle to:<li> creating transferable value (making the business less Jorge-dependent) and</li><li> motivating his children to stay in the company.</li>One day Jorge and his Exit Planning advisor were talking about their love of fast cars when the advisor suggested that Jorge might enjoy attending a racing school. Jorge enrolled and, within a year, his passion for the business gave way to another: car racing. This was a classic case of an owner exiting only once he or she has found something even more attractive outside the company. Further, if Jorge&rsquo;s advisor had thought of himself solely as a CPA, attorney or financial advisor rather than as Jorge&rsquo;s Exit Planning advisor (and thus committed to attaining the goals he&rsquo;d helped Jorge to set at the beginning of the Exit Planning process), it is unlikely that he would have even made this suggestion.Exiting a business is likely the biggest financial decision and personal decision of a person&rsquo;s business life. Only owners should decide when they are comfortable leaving the business, but as advisors we can help them make that decision by testing their assumptions, asking important questions and providing information . . . all topics of future articles.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-28 18:06:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-28 18:06:51.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_L0ZwMKo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/two-great-reasons-advisors-stay-in-their-businesses/\", \"post_id\": \"12132\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-28 18:06:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-28 18:06:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"two-great-reasons-advisors-stay-in-their-businesses\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12131\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5889\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Two-Great-Reasons-Advisors-Stay-In-Their-Businesses.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"467\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467194400,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

Will Britain really leave the EU?","link":"buyers-remorse-will-britain-really-leave-the-eu","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The world saw one of the most cataclysmic political events in decades on Thursday, June 23, 2016, with a majority of British voters choosing to leave the European Union (EU). The decision was a huge surprise, with oddsmakers and financial market traders expecting the opposite. Betting markets gave &lsquo;Remain&rsquo; an  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/upshot/why-the-surprise-over-brexit-dont-blame-the-polls.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=upshot&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">  88 percent chance </a>  to win. Instead, &lsquo;Leave&rsquo; won 52 percent to 48 percent.</p><p> Final polling leading up to the referendum showed &lsquo;Remain&rsquo; with a slight edge, but there was always the possibility of &lsquo;Leave&rsquo; pulling out ahead given the margin of error &ndash; 17 of 35 surveys in June showed &lsquo;Leave&rsquo; ahead, while only 15 had &lsquo;Remain&rsquo; in the Lead. Of course, most forecasters expected undecided voters to break heavily toward the &lsquo;Remain&rsquo; camp but this was always conjecture.</p><h3> <strong>  Immediate Repercussions </strong></h3><p> <br/> Financial markets started falling sharply as referendum results started trickling in and the odds of Britain leaving the EU rose. They continued to fall after official results were announced. The British pound really took it on the chin, falling more than 8% on Friday to its lowest level since 1985, and resumed its slide on Monday. Equity markets across the globe are hardly faring much better, with financials taking the biggest hit.</p><p> The uncertainty over Brexit is especially hurting European banks, just as they were  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-shares-drop-as-analysts-weigh-brexit-impact-1467019840\" target=\"_blank\">  beginning to recover </a>  from the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent Eurozone related emergencies. Banks have to decide whether to remain in Britain or shift operations to continental Europe. Up until this point, most global banks have set up shop in the UK and done business in the EU by &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/52d968b0-3a52-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7.html#axzz4CnCtG7ky\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  passporting </a> &rdquo; into the rest of the 28-member bloc. London is also a major center for clearing and settling trades for EU securities. On Saturday, France&rsquo;s central bank governor, Francois Villeroy De Galhau,  <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-ecb-idUSKCN0ZB09K\" target=\"_blank\">  was clear </a>  that London will lose its prized stature, saying:</p><p> &ldquo;If tomorrow Britain is not part of the single market, the City cannot keep this European passport, and clearing houses cannot be located in London either.&rdquo;</p><p> London has been a global financial center for more than a hundred years, but even more so over the last few decades with deregulation and globalization. That status is now under question.</p><p> As we noted in our paper &ldquo; <a href=\"/category/learn/global\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  To Leave or not to Leave: Brexit and Implications </a> &ldquo;, one possible path for Britain is to follow the Norway model: access the single market by becoming a member of the European Economic Area (EEA). This obviously  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/world/europe/boris-johnson-brexit.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\" target=\"_blank\">  comes at a price </a>  &ndash; unfettered movement of European citizens across borders, accepting EU regulations and contributions to the bloc&rsquo;s operating budget &ndash; all of which &lsquo;Leave&rsquo; supporters explicitly campaigned against. The open door immigration policy was a prime motivator for most voters choosing to leave. At the same time, Britain will no longer have a say in creating EU laws.</p><p> Another alarming aspect is that Britain apparently  <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3c76e90a-270e-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89.html#axzz4CnCtG7ky\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  lacks the skills </a>  to go it alone on trade deals with the EU and the rest of the world. The European Commission has taken the lead in trade negotiations for the past four decades, leaving the country bereft of people equipped with the right technical knowledge. Negotiating trade deals takes such intense effort that even concluding them in five years is considered  <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3c76e90a-270e-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89.html#axzz4CnCtG7ky\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  an achievement </a> .</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  Leadership crisis  </strong></h3><p> <br/> It is an open question as to what happens next. While there are several potential paths the UK can take (laid out in our  <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/To-Leave-or-Not-to-Leave-Brexit-and-Implications.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  paper </a> ), we have no idea who is going to take them down one of these. Ultimately, this is a political question.</p><p> Prime Minister David Cameron, an advocate for remaining in the EU, announced his resignation on Friday. He also left it up to his successor to invoke &lsquo;Article 50&rsquo; of the EU treaty, which would start a two-year clock for Britain and EU to negotiate the terms of divorce. Note that no country has ever invoked this before and the treaty does not lay out a roadmap for negotiating an exit &ndash; these complex negotiations could potentially take years. However, Britain will immediately cease to be a member of the EU at the end of those two years, whether or not an agreement has been hashed out &ndash; which could significantly disrupt business, trade and travel. Triggering Article 50 essentially switches the balance of power from Britain to the EU, since the new British Prime Minister will be under enormous pressure to have a deal before time runs out.</p><p> Some European leaders are already  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/top-eu-leader-we-want-britain-out-as-soon-as-possible\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  asking </a>  Britain to invoke Article 50 and begin negotiations immediately. They are reluctant to be charitable to the UK, or even be seen as charitable, so as to prevent a further splintering of the union. In an interview with German television, the President of the European Commision, Jean Claude-Junker, said:</p><p> &ldquo; Britons decided yesterday that they want to leave the European Union, so it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to wait until October to try to negotiate the terms of their departure. I would like to get started immediately. &rdquo;</p><p> However, it does seem that Britain and Europe may be held hostage to leadership struggles within the Conservative party over the next two months (the party has  <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-mps-vote-to-bring-start-of-leadership-contest-forward-to-this-week-a7105691.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  proposed a schedule </a>  so that new leadership is in by September 2nd). It remains to be seen who will emerge out of the chaos to lead Britain, let alone the path they will take to mitigate the effects of Brexit.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Buyers Remorse? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Meanwhile, we are already seeing some back-pedaling in Britain by supporters of the &lsquo;Leave&rsquo; camp.</p><p> Boris Johnson, one of the lead campaigners for &lsquo;Leave&rsquo;, and possible front-runner for Prime Minister, acknowledged in an opinion piece for  <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/26/i-cannot-stress-too-much-that-britain-is-part-of-europe--and-alw/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Telegraph </a>  that the result &ndash; 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent &ndash; was &ldquo; not entirely overwhelming &ldquo;. He stressed that Britain would always be part of Europe, with access to the single market. Yet it is unlikely that Britain can achieve this status without allowing for an open door immigration policy with the EU and contributing to the bloc&rsquo;s budget.</p><p> We have also seen a surge in Google searches about the impact of Brexit, suggesting that people are only now coming to grips with the consequences of leaving,  after  the official results were announced.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/top-brexit-questions.png\" width=\"576\"/></p><p> Google trends search results on the European Union  after Brexit referendum results were announced. Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/746303118820937728\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Google Trends </a> .</p><p> Further  <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/24/12024634/brexit-supporters-regret-vote/in/11741053\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  anecdotes </a>  include those saying they voted to leave solely as a protest, without actually intending for Britain to leave the EU. All this post-referendum consternation, let alone billions of dollars of losses across financial markets, has led to the obvious question as to whether Brexit will actually happen.</p><h3> <strong>  Will Britain really leave the EU? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Britain&rsquo;s vote to exit the European Union is NOT legally binding. It is, for all practical purposes, an advisory. Also, once Article 50 of the EU Treaty is invoked, Britain cannot back out. So David Cameron&rsquo;s successor can simply dither on invoking Article 50 or just ignore the referendum &ndash; though it is hard to see these as politically feasible options.</p><p> Note that it is not unusual for governments to sidestep the results of a referendum on questions about Europe:</p><p> &ndash; France in 2005 on the EU constitution &ndash; 54.9% rejected but were ignored</p><p> &ndash; Netherlands in 2005 on the EU constitution &ndash; 61.5% rejected but were ignored</p><p> A second referendum on EU related questions is also not unprecedented:</p><p> &ndash; Denmark in 1992 on the Maastricht Treaty &ndash; 51.7% rejected but they were made to vote again</p><p> &ndash; Ireland in 2001 on the Nice Treaty &ndash; 53.9% rejected but they were made to vote again</p><p> &ndash; Ireland in 2008 on the Lisbon Treaty &ndash; 53.2% rejected but they were made to vote again</p><p> However, Cameron  <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-what-is-eu-referendum-petition-david-cameron-a7105596.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ruled out </a>  a second referendum on Monday despite a popular petition that has already garnered more than three million signatures. The other option is for the Prime Minister to call for a general election &ndash; again, a highly unlikely proposition since the Conservative party (which is in power till 2020) then risks the prospect of losing to the opposition Labour party, even while their own side remains deeply divided on the issue of leaving the EU.</p><h3> <strong>  Can Scotland bail out Britain? </strong></h3><p> <br/> An interesting option being hotly debated in legal circles is whether Scotland can bail out the UK. Based on a reading of the  <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Scotland Act of 1998 </a> , it appears that the Scottish Parliament has to consent to measures that eliminate the application of EU laws in Scotland &ndash; effectively, a seeming veto. Now, the British parliament can  <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/25/12031254/no-brexit-article-50\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  pass its own laws </a>  to amend/over-turn decades of law giving Scotland  (and Northern Ireland &amp; Wales for that matter) local control over their affairs. Whether or not the Conservative party will be willing to do so is yet another open question.</p><p> Scotland and Northern Ireland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, and any attempt to over-ride their vote and move forward with Brexit, will trigger calls for independence from the UK. This is already happening, with Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland,  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-36620375\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  saying </a>  that a second Scottish independence vote is &ldquo;highly likely&rdquo;. She said it was &ldquo;democratically unacceptable&rdquo; that Scotland would be taken out of the EU against its will.</p><p> In short, we could be looking at a splintering of the United Kingdom if Brexit actually goes through. This is yet another issue the next leader of Britain will have to immediately grapple with, amongst everything else.</p><h3> <strong>  More uncertainty  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Some events are true black swans &ndash; for example, the September 11th terrorist attacks or the Tsunami in Japan &ndash; one-off events that create immediate financial panic, but may or may not exacerbate underlying economic vulnerabilities. However, Brexit is different in that it is a manifestation of underlying forces of populism that have been building for years amid low economic growth and loss of faith in traditional institutions, which have promoted liberal immigration and trade policies, let alone monetary policy that seems to have lost its bite.</p><p> Britain accounts for less than 4 percent of world GDP, but the forces made stronger by Brexit is what makes the situation more than just an immediate economic threat. The resulting political upheaval creates a much wider range of possible outcomes, creating ever more uncertainty for the global economy and financial markets.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-28 18:39:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-28 18:39:50.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_Q9LFyXA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/buyers-remorse-will-britain-really-leave-the-eu/\", \"post_id\": \"12134\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-28 18:39:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-28 18:39:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"buyers-remorse-will-britain-really-leave-the-eu\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12131\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5890\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Two-Great-Reasons-Advisors-Stay-In-Their-Businesses.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"797\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467230400,"author_id":158,"chart_url":""}

This information forms the basis for the advice they will provide to their client, whether through consultation or discretionary investment management. Understandably, the advisor is in continuous possession of private client information while servicing a particular client, investor, or related participant.</p><p> Section 30(a) of Regulation S-P under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 requires advisors (along with broker-dealers and investment companies) to adopt policies and procedures that create administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of customer records and information. These policies and procedures must must be reasonably designed to:</p><li> Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information;</li><li> Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer records and information; and</li><li> Protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. <br/>  </li><p> The SEC has said that an RIA&rsquo;s policies and procedures must include how advisors conduct periodic risk assessments, implement a firewall, encrypt private client information stored electronically, and maintain a response plan for cybersecurity incidents. Advisors are expected to anticipate potential cybersecurity events and have clear procedures in place rather than waiting to react once a breach occurs. <a href=\"http://blog.advisorassist.com/2016/06/cybersecurity-best-practices-and.html#fn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  1 </a> .</p><h3> <strong>  Why You Should Care </strong></h3><p> <br/> Identify theft, cyber fraud and high profile security breaches have become common occurrences, especially among commercial merchants and asset managers.

{"original_id":5662,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Fix Your Advisory Firm Incentive Compensation Plan","link":"how-to-fix-your-advisory-firm-incentive-compensation-plan","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> A majority of employees at advisory firms &mdash; both professional and nonprofessional &mdash; now receive a combination of base salary and incentive pay, industry studies find. <br/>  </h3><p> But firms don&rsquo;t seem to be satisfied with their pay packages and, at my consulting firm, the most highly requested engagement is for designing (or, more commonly, redesigning) incentive compensation.</p><p> The reasons vary. Perhaps the current plan is not sustainable from a profitability perspective over time. Or maybe the plan is not delivering the intended and needed outcomes. Either way, they come to us when they find that their incentive plan needs an upgrade to align compensation with the company&rsquo;s overall success.</p><p> To back up for a minute: Think of base salary as fair compensation for an employee&rsquo;s role and responsibilities, while incentive compensation should be geared toward meeting or exceeding stretch goals for the firm, the individual or perhaps both.</p><p> Both should be part of a well-documented compensation plan, which covers a lot more than just how much you pay people. Every firm should have a thorough compensation plan designed to make the most of your &ldquo;people investment&rdquo; &mdash; by attracting and retaining good people; motivating them to improve their performance, and directly tying performance to delivery against the firm&rsquo;s business plan and goals.</p><p> The most aggressive, competitive firms in the industry take just such an approach. These firms make sure they have a human capital strategy &mdash; a strategy for how to manage, develop and retain their key talent in a way that ties to the overall business plan.</p><p> Every firm needs to leverage a unique combination of rewards and incentives that will work best for that firm, its people and its clients. From a practical standpoint, a comprehensive compensation plan should have five key components: base salary and incentive compensation (both short and long term), as well as benefits and other nonfinancial rewards, retirement plans and equity/ownership options. You&rsquo;ll need to customize each of these to fit your firm&rsquo;s strategic objectives and competitive environment. </p><p> But ultimately, salary and incentives remain the primary drivers in any firm&rsquo;s compensation program.</p><h3> WHAT&rsquo;S THE GOAL? <br/>  </h3><p> A key part of any salary and incentive program &mdash; and one that is often ignored by firms &mdash; is the need to set baseline expectations, with documented job descriptions and performance goals and objectives.</p><p> All compensation &mdash; but especially base salary &mdash; should come with a specific set of expectations that can be measured and evaluated. By documenting the firm&rsquo;s expectations, employees know what specific tasks and results are expected as a baseline, and what additional performance and stretch goals will result in higher compensation.</p><p> Those clear metrics for success will help guide employees in aligning their efforts with firm goals, and building their skills for higher achievement. They will also help firms establish the stretch goals that will eventually determine incentives.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Define a base-salary range for each position, based on both the value of the position to your firm and the market value of the role. Revisit those salary ranges on a continuing basis and adjust as needed with market changes. You can move employees within the range as their job responsibilities and skill sets change over time.</p><p> Incentive compensation is a bit trickier. The goal here is to leverage employees&rsquo; own motivation to improve behaviors and practices that drive the firm&rsquo;s success. As a result, incentive plans should be tied to specific objectives and outcomes &mdash; showing employees how the incentive is a financial partnership between them and the firm.</p><p> I usually caution firms against two other types of compensation increases. Automatic cost-of-living adjustments are problematic because they increase a firm&rsquo;s fixed costs and are not tied to measurable results that have a positive impact on the firm. I also recommend staying away from discretionary bonuses, which are generally paid without regard for any measurable criteria. These are less effective in motivating behavior, since they do not create a clear tie between pay and performance; they can also foster an entitlement mentality for employees.</p><h3> 8 INCENTIVE PLAN ESSENTIALS <br/>  </h3><p> Whether your firm needs a new incentive plan or simply wants to overhaul an existing one, use the following steps to design the plan.</p><p> <strong>  1) Start with the firm&rsquo;s strategic goals.  </strong> Be sure you&rsquo;re designing an incentive plan that is in alignment with your firm&rsquo;s strategic goals and initiatives. Strategic goals may include an aggressive financial growth plan, new market development, key additions to the team, product or service specialization, and potential acquisitions.</p><p> <strong>  2) Create a compensation philosophy.  </strong> The purpose of a good compensation philosophy is to attract, retain, and motivate good people. Considerations when developing your compensation philosophy should include: How competitive is the advisory services industry in your market? What is your firm&rsquo;s cost structure and future financial outlook? Most important, how does your compensation philosophy fit into your overall business plan?</p><p> <strong>  3) Determine eligible positions.  </strong> Decide what goals and objectives are desired and determine who will participate. I recommend allowing everyone to participate, regardless of their role &mdash; because doing so uses the incentives to build a unified vision for the firm. You&rsquo;ll also want to define the percentage of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; or incentive compensation for each employee.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> <strong>  4) Identify the funding source.  </strong> A key element of your plan design is to ensure the highest possible level of fiscal responsibility, while still ensuring controllability for each plan participant. The following funding options ensure that the plan is generally self-funded: percent of firm revenue, percent of firm profit and percent of firm profit above an operating profit margin threshold.</p><p> <strong>  5) Set the incentive drivers.  </strong> Individual-based incentive drivers will vary based on role.Types of work that push the incentive drivers include business development, investment performance, firm revenue growth and client retention. The incentive drivers can be based on team performance and/or individual performance, but I recommend not having more than five performance metrics to a plan. Having too many metrics tends to dilute the overall focus of your individual employee and team.</p><p> <strong>  6) Run the numbers to make sure they work. </strong>  Model the implications of your pool and determine the potential cost of the plan. Make sure you consider a good year, a bad year and a great year, and be sure to factor future growth into the modeling.</p><p> <strong>  7) Get team input (and buy-in).  </strong> Get employees who will be participants in the plan involved in the design process early. Ask employees how they are contributing to the success of your firm and then begin the process of creating stretch goals that align with your key initiatives. Getting employee input also helps create buy-in from your team.</p><p> <strong>  8) Communicate and implement the plan. </strong>  Once the plan is complete, communicate the plan and determine how it will be tracked and monitored. Although your plan may need to be adjusted or tweaked year over year, a well-designed plan should not be redesigned every year. Rather, a consistent plan that is well designed and implemented will engage and retain your key talent.</p><p> Determining the exact mix of salary and incentive for each employee is more an art than a science. Each firm must find its own optimal mix, with the understanding that all compensation to some degree needs to be tied to objectives and performance against those objectives.</p><p> That&rsquo;s what maximizes the value of your most important investment: your people.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-29 15:35:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-29 15:35:14.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_MYJ1Swu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-fix-your-advisory-firm-incentive-compensation-plan/\", \"post_id\": \"12140\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-29 15:35:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-29 15:35:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-fix-your-advisory-firm-incentive-compensation-plan\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12139\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5894\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Fix-Your-Advisory-Firm-Incentive-Compensation-Plan.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"883\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467280800,"author_id":270,"chart_url":""}

Embrace These Characteristics","link":"want-to-be-a-top-sales-producer-embrace-these-characteristics","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you&rsquo;re reading this article right now, then chances are you want to perform better in your sales career. It shows that you&rsquo;re willing to take the time to search out tips and techniques that will give you an edge over your competition. That&rsquo;s a good thing.</p><p> But are you ready to really commit to doing the things that will catapult you into that rarified air of top sales producers?</p><p> And chance are, you know who these top producers are. They&rsquo;re the ones who are always at or near the top of the sales production list every month, always winning the sales contests, and who always seem to be in a good mood. They&rsquo;re positive, confident, and they have that feeling that no matter what happens to the leads or the economy or the company, they&rsquo;ll find a way to succeed.</p><p> Years ago I heard a sales motivator say that if you are willing to the do the things that most sales reps aren&rsquo;t willing to do, then soon you&rsquo;ll be able to do and have and enjoy the things that most sales reps will never be able to.</p><p> When I heard that statement, I was a struggling sales rep, and I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. I was at a crossroads in my career, and I was either going to find a different way of making a living, or I was going to go back to school and get out of sales altogether.</p><p> What I chose to do was commit to being one of the top producers. I heard another motivator say that if the grass looks greener on the other side, then you need to fertilize your lawn. He said that you don&rsquo;t have to change where you are to succeed, but rather you can bloom where you&rsquo;re planted.</p><p> And I had many examples of that in the company where I worked. There were 25 sales reps, and while most of them had varying levels of inconsistent success (I call those the 80% of the any sales team), there were also the top producers who consistently were at the top of the sales charts. They were the ones who made the most commissions, drove the nice cars, went on the fun vacations.</p><p> These top producers were also the ones who made it look easy. They never seemed to struggle; instead, they seemed to intuitively know what to do. It was inspiring and intimidating at the same time. It wasn&rsquo;t until I finally made a commitment to be one of them that I saw how much time and discipline and effort they put into being the best.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> While it did take time, money and lots of effort for me to go from where I was as a struggling sales rep, with commitment and determination I became the number one sales rep at the company in 90 days. And the habits I developed allowed me to be the number one rep out of five branch offices just nine months later.</p><p> And you can do it, too. The good news is that success leaves clues, and if you&rsquo;re willing to invest the time, money and effort into completely changing your results, your life and your family&rsquo;s life, then you can. You can bloom where you&rsquo;re planted, and you can start enjoying the things that top producers take for granted &ndash; the things that most sales reps will never get to enjoy.</p><p> I guarantee that if you adopt this one characteristic, then nothing will stop you from succeeding&hellip;.</p><h3> Top Characteristic of Top Sales Producers: Make a commitment to doing whatever is required of you to be a top producer. <br/>  </h3><p> Let me illustrate this with a story. Earlier this year, I was asked to give a keynote speech for a company of a little over 100 sales reps. Before I do any of these kinds of talks, I always ask to do a phone interview with their top producers. I reached out to their top sales rep, a woman working in Canada who had been with the company for just 15 months.</p><p> What was interesting about this sales rep was that she had come from a completely different industry &ndash; not sales &ndash; and yet in the course of about a year, she had become the top sales rep for all of the U.S. and Canada. As you can imagine, I was anxious to speak to her.</p><p> What I found out is what I always find out about top producers. When she joined the company, the first thing she did was make a commitment to work harder than another any person there, and to learn and practice the top principles of qualifying and closing sales.</p><p> I asked her how long she worked and she told me she regularly worked ten to twelve hours a day. I asked her about her family and kids and she said that&rsquo;s what weekends were for.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> When asked how many cold calls she made in a day, she told me about 100. The average sales rep in the company made about 25. I asked how she could make so many calls and still run appointments, and she said she began early, and made calls throughout the day &ndash; while waiting for an appointment in the field, after and between appointments, and then she made some more in the evening when others have long left the office.</p><p> When we talked about the specifics of the sale and how she qualified, she told me she gave her pitch on the first appointment call, told the prospect that she would then show them exactly what she just described and that at the end she would ask for a yes or no. &ldquo;Will you be able to make a decision at that time?&rdquo; was her last question on the appointment call.</p><p> Once on site, if the prospect tried to delay making a decision, she reminded him/her that they promised to commit at that time &ndash; yes or no &ndash; and she then began closing for the sale using proven, scripted (memorized and delivered naturally) closes that worked the majority of the time.</p><p> If the prospect simply wouldn&rsquo;t commit, then she asked them to have a decision made by the end of the day (or next morning if an evening appointment), and she then called back for the yes or no. If it&rsquo;s a no, she moved on.</p><p> When you break down what this number one rep did (and continues to do) to be so successful, you&rsquo;ll find that she does &ldquo;what most sales reps are not willing to do.&rdquo; First, she&rsquo;s made a commitment to working harder and smarter than all of the other reps in the company. When most sales reps are still at home drinking coffee, she is making calls. When most sales reps are shuffling their leads or thinking about lunch, she&rsquo;s still making calls.</p><p> When other sales reps are semi-qualifying their prospects and then showing up and hoping and praying someone will buy, she&rsquo;s already asked for a buying decision before she even gets there. And when many sales reps are put off with a stall at the end, she begins closing when she gets an objection.</p><p> Because of this commitment to be the best, she closes more sales than any other rep in the company (again, of 100+ sales reps). And this enables her to make double what the average sales rep makes, and triple what a third of the struggling reps make.</p><p> When I was at this annual sales conference, the company was giving out the awards, the bonus checks, and the family vacations and other perks. This top producer got all of these rewards, accolades and pats on the back. The other top producers (nine of them) got various awards as well. The other 90 sales reps? They got increased quotas, increased pressure and after three days at the conference, they went back to their jobs to struggle along for another year&hellip;.</p><p> The bottom line in any career or profession is that the top performers are committed to putting in the time and effort to be the best. They are willing to pay the price for success by staying after practice to keep working, by putting in the time for film study or playbook study, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to perform at the top of their game. This is true of top athletes like Michael Jordan, Peyton Manning, Tiger Woods, etc., and for top concert musicians, professional dancers, and virtually any other professional.</p><p> As someone once said, &ldquo;The extra mile is never crowded.&rdquo;</p><p> If you will commit this one characteristic, then you will be able to live, have, enjoy and do the things that most sales people will never be able to have, enjoy and do.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-29 15:50:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-29 15:50:09.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_UsIseam.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-to-be-a-top-sales-producer-embrace-these-characteristics/\", \"post_id\": \"12142\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-29 15:50:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-29 15:50:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-to-be-a-top-sales-producer-embrace-these-characteristics\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12141\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5895\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Want-to-be-a-Top-Sales-Producer-Embrace-These-Characteristics.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"990\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467295200,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5664,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Mega-Trends That Have Redefined Selling","link":"five-mega-trends-that-have-redefined-selling","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/author/sylvia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sylvia Montgomery </a></p><p> Recently, I attended a presentation by Neil Rackman, author of the international groundbreaking classicSPIN&reg; Selling &mdash; a book based on the largest ever research study of successful selling in Fortune 500 firms. In his presentation, Neil identified five mega-trends that have redefined selling. How do these trends impact professional services sales and marketing? Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p><h3> 1. The slow death of sales communication channel <br/>  </h3><p> The act of selling used to be a one-way channel &ndash; a company would spread its marketing message and potential buyers would receive it, often at face value. There was no conversation and the seller controlled how much and when the information was disseminated. However, selling today and selling 10 years ago have completely different meanings. For example in some professional service firms, sales is not a formally organized effort and some firms go as far as considering sales to be a bad word. But selling is a fundamental business function, and a firm&rsquo;s ability to sell its expertise contributes directly to its success.</p><p> Today, sales and marketing in professional services are more about the value that a firm and its experts can bring to an engagement than the firm&rsquo;s list of services. Professional service firms today can&rsquo;t just proclaim &ldquo;we are better or cheaper&rdquo; because that is a dismal race to the commodity pit. Instead, they must focus on selling trust and expertise. In our research for the book Inside the Buyer&rsquo;s Brain we learned that most high-growth professional services firms had three traits in common:</p><li> A reputation for educating their audience</li><li> They had deep experience and a track record of success</li><li> They were likeable/trustworthy</li><p> Each of these criteria come to life throughout online and offline interactions with the firms&rsquo; staff. And for winning firms, marketing and sales (or business development) are where relationships with prospects begin.</p><h3> 2. The widening transactional/consultative sales split <br/>  </h3><p> Oh, the good ol&rsquo; days! Remember when you could send out a brochure and a few weeks or months later, the phone would ring? Those days have mostly disappeared. Today, many buyers do some independent research and self-education before reaching out to a potential provider. Much of that self-education happens online. But education does not end there. Buyers also expect the potential provider to continue to educate them, well after the sale is made. In transactional selling, buyers&rsquo; decisions are heavily influenced by price. And when companies can&rsquo;t lower their prices any further, they rely on their marketing and sales pitches to persuade clients to choose their services over similar competitors.</p><p> However, in consultative selling buyers seek out expertise and they develop trust in a seller over time &mdash; throughout the customer journey. This selling approach relies more on buyer education.</p><p> According to our research, 80.8% of prospective buyers visit a firm&rsquo;s website at some point during the buying process. And 43.6% rule out a firm because they weren&rsquo;t convinced by the website that the firm could help them. In this new reality for sales and marketing, keep in mind this equation:</p><p> Benefits &ndash; Cost = Value</p><p> Today&rsquo;s winning professional services firms seek to crystalize that value through well defined differentiators. In our research we have found that expertise is the factor that most often tips the scale in favor of the expert individual or firm. So the extent to which you&rsquo;re differentiated around expertise in turn affects the speed of your ascent to greater visibility.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 3. Marketing is the new sales <br/>  </h3><p> Nothing happens until someone sells something. The old adage of &ldquo;do a good job and clients will follow&rdquo; is no longer a reliable or effective strategy. Instead, today&rsquo;s professional service firms need strong and sophisticated marketing leadership. One of the biggest challenges within firms is finding talent that combine critical thinking, a wide digital skillset and a practical understanding of analytics. Firms with no marketing departments or marketing coordinators that focus solely on preparing RFP responses are not positioned for success in the future. Winning firms are quickly embracing the role of the chief marketing officer (CMO) and investing in the ongoing training of their marketing and sales talent.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4. Rise and fall of classic purchasing theory <br/>  </h3><p> With the decline in transactional selling, you also have the fall of price-based purchasing tied to a traditional procurement mentality. Instead, it&rsquo;s about how well your firm can communicate its value through strong differentiators. From our research into high growth professional services firms, we know that high growth firms are three times more likely to have a strong differentiator. The ultimate goal is to engage with prospects that recognize they have a problem and need an expert to help them solve it&hellip; and not engage with those that are simply looking for an estimate.</p><h3> 5. Crippling cost of big sales <br/>  </h3><p> In other words, selling takes time and money. How well do you understand the prospects&rsquo; needs, internal or external challenges and unspoken fears? The more you know about your clients and prospects, the more you will be able to determine if there is a good fit and if you are relevant to their needs. Does your firm know how much it costs to chase a typical opportunity? Do your leaders recognize that cutting down on the number of opportunities/pursuits will actually create more business? How educated are your prospects about the types of problems you can solve? The best way to answer these questions is to conduct research on your target audience &mdash; and to talk to prospects and clients as you take them though the client journey.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-29 16:09:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-29 16:09:02.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_lNjUOEE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-mega-trends-that-have-redefined-selling/\", \"post_id\": \"12144\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-29 16:09:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-29 16:09:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-mega-trends-that-have-redefined-selling\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12143\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5896\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Five-Mega-Trends-That-Have-Redefined-Selling.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"834\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467277200,"author_id":300,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5665,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Ways To Give Your Advisor Firm A Mid-Year Checkup","link":"6-ways-to-give-your-advisor-firm-a-mid-year-checkup","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> We have passed the halfway point of 2016, so it&rsquo;s a natural time of year to pause, review your progress and set direction for the rest of the year. <br/>  </h3><p> So far, it has been a mixed year for most financial advisors.</p><p> For many advisors, year-over-year results have shown steady, yet unremarkable, improvement. If your year is off to a good start, you need to keep the momentum going.</p><p> Ask yourself, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s been working? How can I compound my success?&rdquo;</p><p> The solution may be as simple as continuing what you&rsquo;ve started.</p><p> On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re off to a slower start, you should kick your business up a notch.</p><p> Ask yourself, &ldquo;How can I take advantage of the current environment? What&rsquo;s the one thing I can do now to set a positive trajectory for the rest of the year?&rdquo;</p><p> Remember, the activities that you start today will have a big impact on your year-end results.</p><p> Go ahead and use these six questions to help you analyze your practice.</p><p> Whether your business is up, down or just holding its own, you should take some time to review these questions.</p><p> Better yet, hold a meeting with your team and discuss these questions as a group.</p><p> If regular review meetings are good for assessing your clients well-being, they&rsquo;re equally important for taking the temperature of your business.</p><h3> 1. Do your clients know you better now than they did at the end of 2015? <br/>   </h3><p> Financial advisors who have had a strong first half of 2016 will answer this question with a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Increased client care has been a key driver for new business and referrals.</p><p> When you constantly strive to stay in front of your clients, they truly get to know you better. They are more likely to place unsolicited calls for help.</p><p> And they are more open to new ideas when you proactively approach them.</p><p> If you want to focus on this aspect of your practice for the remainder of the year, focus on a monthly client communication strategy that leverages a systematic approach for servicing your clients based on their importance to your practice.</p><p> You and your team could also send a simple letter or email to those you do not reach. When combined with client meetings, regular correspondence and the interactions of daily business, you will build loyalty and increase production.</p><h3> 2. Do you have a steady flow of referrals? <br/>  </h3><p> Most financial advisors believe that referrals are their best source of new business. After all, referrals tend to represent higher-quality new relationships.</p><p> Plus, a good referral stream eliminates the need for other timely and costly marketing strategies. So far in 2016, many of the advisors are reporting an increase in the quantity and the quality of their referrals.  And, client advocacy is my favorite approach.</p><p> When you turn advocacy into an everyday success habit, you are opening the door for exponential business growth.</p><p> For many advisors, this may be the only marketing strategy you need.</p><h3> 3. Is your 2016 pipeline stocked with worthwhile prospects? <br/>  </h3><p> I regularly hear from producers who have lost control of their client acquisition process. They either don&rsquo;t have a plan for adding qualified new prospects to their database or they are having difficulty converting the prospects they do have into clients.</p><p> If you are looking for a prospecting activity to give your business an almost immediate boost, start by spending time getting your current prospect database under control.</p><p> Many of your current prospects are willing to meet with you if you have a good idea, but you have to make it known.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Is your team clicking on all cylinders? <br/>  </h3><p> Analyzing your practice must include reviewing your team and your team structure.</p><p> Though this may sound like an overwhelming task, particularly if you have a simple advisor/assistant set-up, it&rsquo;s a must. Top producers realize that they need to spend as much time as possible in front of clients and prospects talking about new business opportunities.</p><p> Meanwhile, successful assistants prefer to take control of administrative, service and/or marketing activities, therefore giving the advisor more time for clients and prospects. Though this sounds very logical, it is often-times overlooked in the hustle and bustle of day-to-day business.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 5. Are you on target to achieve your financial goals for 2016? <br/>  </h3><p> Many times, production, asset and new relationship goals are forgotten as soon after they are established.</p><p> This usually happens when advisors just throw out numbers and they are not committed to challenging themselves. As the second half of the year approaches, spend some time re-assessing your goals. Have you given yourself enough of a challenge? Too much?</p><p> Can you break your financial goals down into manageable activities?  Are the activities you already have planned going to help you achieve your goals?</p><p> What&rsquo;s your success formula? When I was more actively running my practice as a financial advisor, I had a simple success formula &ndash; 12 by 12, 2 by 5, plan each day.</p><p> I used this formula to triple my business over a two year period of time. In my coaching work, I help my clients develop similar success formulas.</p><p> Be sure to revisit any ideas that may help you create your own success formula for the second half of 2016.</p><h3> 6. Are you increasing the professionalism of your practice? <br/>  </h3><p> Finally, producers and teams that are building the greatest momentum toward a breakout year are constantly finding ways to improve the &ldquo;business&rdquo; behind their businesses.</p><p> These folks attend workshops, listen to web classes and read as much as they can about the tactics and success habits of top producers. They want to know what is working on topics ranging from time management to wealth management to practice management.</p><p> They do more than just meet their continuing education requirements; they set aside regular time for professional development for themselves and their staffs.</p><p> The year is only halfway done; it&rsquo;s not too late to set yourself on a breakout path for increasing production and streamlining your practice.</p><p> Answer these questions now, and 2016 could be your best year yet.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-29 16:27:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-29 16:27:33.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_rgY4ILX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-ways-to-give-your-advisor-firm-a-mid-year-checkup/\", \"post_id\": \"12146\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-29 16:27:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-29 16:27:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-ways-to-give-your-advisor-firm-a-mid-year-checkup\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12145\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5897\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6-Ways-To-Give-Your-Advisor-Firm-A-Mid-Year-Checkup.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"656\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467277200,"author_id":403,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5666,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Essentials to Keep Stoking Your Creativity Consistently","link":"the-essentials-to-keep-stoking-your-creativity-consistently","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We are all born creative. The urge to create&mdash;to put your stamp on something&mdash;is innate. And even if you don&rsquo;t define yourself by your creativity, your business thrives on it.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the engine that produces your ideas, services and products and inspires how you market and sell.</p><p> It helps you build your unique competitive advantage so you can sell at healthy margins and be selective about which work you take on and which markets you enter.</p><p> So make no mistake: making time to be creative is mission-critical.</p><p> The challenge? We&rsquo;re all wired a bit differently when it comes to channeling our creativity into our work.</p><p> Your (working) creative genius may be writing, while someone else may be all about developing new services, shooting videos or designing artwork.</p><p> The commonality, especially for idea-driven entrepreneurs, is to carve out the time and space to be creative.</p><h3> Try these four essentials to keep stoking your creativity consistently: <br/>  </h3><h3> One: Have some fun <br/>  </h3><p> Have you ever noticed that your best ideas come when your mind is not on task? On a walk, at the beach, cooking up a gourmet treat, having a chat with an old friend. Indulging your creativity should be fun&mdash;and forcing it pretty much guarantees it won&rsquo;t be. So instead of being that person&mdash;the one who seems to always be working 24/7&mdash;do something just for you. Spark some joy and your creative muse will rise up to thank you.</p><h3> Two: Think white space <br/>  </h3><p> White space is having the physical and emotional space to think freely. I tend to create best when there is order AND beauty around me, with nothing more than light ambient noise (unless I&rsquo;m at the ocean&mdash;crashing surf always inspires me). You may be the complete opposite&mdash;which is why you want to create the white space that works reliably for you. Oh, and this also means silencing that nit-picky editor that lives in your head.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Three: Build it into your week <br/>  </h3><p> This sounds like a creativity killer, but it&rsquo;s actually the reverse. Consistently attending to your creativity is liberating. It&rsquo;s not only something you can look forward to, but that continued focus pays dividends. You may have to sacrifice something else&mdash;an hour of TV-watching or catching a movie with friends&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll feel more alive from having fed your own creativity than consuming someone else&rsquo;s.</p><h3> Four: Follow your curiosity  <br/>  </h3><p> Let&rsquo;s face it, this is where you most want to go AND where your interest will sustain you. What challenges are you most curious to explore? What gets your motor revving?

{"original_id":5667,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why You Should Step Back and Assess Your Online Presence","link":"why-you-should-step-back-and-assess-your-online-presence","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As a student looking for work, I was repeatedly asked, &ldquo;Do you have a LinkedIn account?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What do your social media accounts say about you?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;What kind of an impression are you making on the digital front?&rdquo;It has become very common for employers to look for potential candidates through social media and use it to vet applicants. So, ask yourself, &ldquo;What do my social media accounts say about me and how can that affect my Advisory firm?&rdquo;Just as employers use the internet to find the right candidates for their organization, your prospects look to the internet to decide who the right Financial Advisor is for them. So, take a step back and assess the online presence of your business:Where can I be found online?</p><li> A personal website</li><li> Your company&rsquo;s website</li><li> Your social media accounts &ndash; Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc</li><li> You were featured in a news article</li><li> A guest blog you&rsquo;ve written</li>There are many ways to get your name (and your Advisory Firm) out there.<h3> 1. Create a website</h3>We are in the digital age of &ldquo;Googling&rdquo;. People will Google anything and everything, including which Financial Advisor would be best suited for them. Having a well designed, user-friendly, and dynamic website can help you gain credibility as a Financial Advisor by continuously establishing a great first impression with website visitors. Adding non-financial information such as community involvement, charitable endeavours and local events on your website can also help build strong relationships between you and your audience. A website can act as an extension of your business. It has the capacity to be a 24/7 online business that is working and available to clients and prospects, even when you aren&rsquo;t. If you put the work in, your website can be a hub of answers for your clients and prospects.<h3> 2. Create and build your social media accounts</h3>Gone are the days where a first impression occurs when you first meet and shake someone&rsquo;s hand, especially in the Financial Services industry. Considering that 70% of the buyer journey is completed before reaching out to a company, chances are your prospects have researched you prior to your first phone call or meeting. Having a strong social media presence that effectively articulates your services, brand and you as an Advisor, can be the difference between a gaining another prospect or a client.<h3> 3. Blog!</h3>It is said that the millennial generation, also known as your future clients, have an approximate purchasing power of $200 billion. 88% of millennials used Facebook as their main source of news in 2015. When it comes to news, answering questions, a means for entertainment (the list goes on) &ndash; we, the millennial generation, will turn to answers or information we find online and share it with our peers.81% of U.S. online consumers trust information and advice from blogs (<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/BlogHer/2012-social-media-final-v2?ref=http://www.blogher.com/women-and-social-media-2012\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> BlogHer</a>). Blogging is one of the best ways to have a conversation with your audience by answering their questions in a non-intrusive manner. Blogging is also a great way to boost your websites search engine optimization (SEO) and ranking. Improving your search engine ranking can also help improve traffic to your website, all while building your digital brand.So, to get you started on building a better digital you, do a quick audit of your existing online presence:<li> Do I have a website? Is it mobile friendly?</li><li> Do I have a profile on my company&rsquo;s website?</li><li> Do I have an account on at least 1 social media platform?</li><li> Am I active on my account(s)?</li><li> Have I blogged?</li><li> When will I start (or continue) to build a better digital presence?</li>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-29 17:22:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-29 17:22:18.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_M09Zw4u.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-should-step-back-and-assess-your-online-presence/\", \"post_id\": \"12149\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-29 17:22:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-29 17:22:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-should-step-back-and-assess-your-online-presence\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12150\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5900\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-You-Should-Step-Back-and-Assess-Your-Online-Presence.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"911\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467302400,"author_id":195,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5668,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Reasons Your Advisor Website Needs a Big Makeover","link":"10-reasons-your-advisor-website-needs-a-big-makeover","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whether you are an advisor or an RIA, if your website doesn&rsquo;t have a clear and compelling purpose for your business, you are likely wasting your time and your money. That may frustrate the heck out of you because you&rsquo;ve relied on a professional service to either implement a template or custom design your website. You&rsquo;re an expert on managing wealth; you shouldn&rsquo;t have to be a digital marketing expert too. The trouble is, it&rsquo;s not easy finding help you can trust and help that knows the financial business.</p><h3> Financial website providers often: <br/>  </h3><li> Don&rsquo;t know your industry and therefore they either require a lot of learning that increases fees, they rely on you too much for content and direction, which also increases your costs, or they build a version of what the advisor down the street is using.</li><li> Are technical experts, not marketing experts. They focus on bells and whistles such as calculators, article libraries, stock market tickers, and newsletter sign-ups. They are great at getting you a site for what appears to be a reasonable price, but the real cost is actually huge. These sites typically have a huge opportunity-loss cost by missing out on attracting and resonating to your specific audience. Bells and whistles don&rsquo;t attract clients = a clear value proposition that resonates with their situation does.</li><li> Produce volumes of financial websites, seminar marketing and content. There&rsquo;s often more value in this approach than any above but for most firms, it leaves them wanting and needing much more. The biggest issue here is looking like everyone else, having access to the same generic content as everyone else and really not standing out in any area such as design, content or message. They produce &ldquo;average&rdquo; websites that appeal to their &ldquo;average&rdquo; clients (FAs). That&rsquo;s just what the &ldquo;volume&rdquo; business is. Mass produced websites with accompanying content are not what you need to get real results from your website.</li><p> A word on marketing consultants that &ldquo;just consult&rdquo;:</p><p> There are several &ldquo;expert&rdquo; marketing consultants out there that do indeed understand the financial services industry. The problem is they often know jack-weed (again &ndash; my apologies to compliance departments) about building effective websites. They often stick around and &ldquo;oversee&rdquo; a handoff to a website development company, leading to your website being more of an afterthought than a focus. They need to know what works, and what doesn&rsquo;t, before they build a plan and hand it off.</p><h3> 10 Reasons Your Advisor Website Needs a Makeover <br/>  </h3><p> I know how annoying it is to have to pay for work when the person doing the work was expected to know how to get it right &ndash; if not the first time, at least the second or third time! I&rsquo;m the shoulder many advisors and firms end up crying on because they&rsquo;ve essentially wasted their website (and marketing) budgets time and again. Here are ten advisor website tips to keep you from making the same mistakes again (and again).</p><h3> #1 &ndash; Lacks Focus <br/>  </h3><p> Many sites I see have a lack of focus. They jump from one idea to the next or one service to ten. It&rsquo;s as if they forget who they are marketing too. Your site (design and content) and its message need to be highly relevant to the audience you want to attract.</p><h3> #2 &ndash; Lacks Flow &amp; Continuity <br/>  </h3><p> Website layouts and designs have improved significantly with the advent of content management systems such as WordPress and Joomla, but now what I find is advisors are forced to put their &ldquo;ideas and content&rdquo; into a template that isn&rsquo;t suitable for their audience, message and purpose. Mass produced website templates continue to lack good design and intuitive navigation. Even with their recent upgrades in content (generic financial videos) and social media integration. Your content needs to drive your template &ndash; not the other way around.</p><h3> #3 &ndash; Lacks Purpose <br/>  </h3><p> I find few prospects we&rsquo;ve worked with have ever discussed the goal or role of their website in detail. A website can-be, should-be, a key driver for your financial business. This might include prospecting objectives, client communication or brand awareness. Regardless, it&rsquo;s critical to know its role in your sales, service and marketing process before building. Is your site aimed at getting people to attend your regional workshops? Is your site aimed at influencing social media networks? Is your site aimed at impressing 50+ aged advisors to join your RIA? Is your site integrated with your radio program and or book? Is your site a place you want prospects coming back to time and again? Are you looking to build credibility or are you looking to build your client base?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> #4 &ndash; Lacks Depth <br/>  </h3><p> Depth is the single most significant deficiency I see with all types of financial websites. From the large broker dealers, to the RIA to the independent advisor website, they lack proof they are what they say with any kind of depth. They are shallow marketing copy heavy online brochures. When most consumers look at an RIA website that says, &ldquo;We are Trusted Advisors&rdquo;, without clear proof or support, they think &ldquo;yeah right&rdquo;. Financial companies and professionals rarely showcase how they are different; with highly relevant papers or articles, video, clearly articulated investment philosophies, diagrammed planning or investment process, a book, a consistent message throughout, a clear niche, and a clear target audience. Depth builds trust and people need to trust you before considering next steps. Trust is not achieved by writing, &ldquo;our clients trust us&rdquo; on your site. Too often websites say, &ldquo;we do this and that&rdquo; when they should be answering &ldquo;and this is how we do it, who we do it for, and why&rdquo;.</p><h3> #5 &ndash; Lacks Engagement <br/>  </h3><p> One of the most important roles for most websites we&rsquo;ve built is user engagement. This is the equivalent of a call-to-action but its purpose isn&rsquo;t limited to &ldquo;call us&rdquo;. Engagement is getting an ideal prospect (website visitor) to &ldquo;click&rdquo; on something to learn more about your firm&rsquo;s insights or to begin experiencing what it would be like to be a client. Engagement keeps them on your site longer, gets them experiencing your firm and builds trust.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> #6 &ndash; Lacks Differentiation <br/>  </h3><p> Next to lack of depth, differentiation is the next most deficient, although important, website attribute. In an industry that seems similar in many ways to many people, being seen as different can&rsquo;t be marginalized or ignored. Lets face it, to the general consumer, all FIs are the same &ndash; unless they have a compelling reason to choose you they will gravitate towards a brand they recognize that is 5 minutes closer to drive to. Finding and articulating your uniqueness in a way that resonates and seems different or better, is critical to people wanting to take next steps with you. Your website is often the first place they go before they ever speak with or visit you.</p><h3> #7 &ndash; Lacks Visibility <br/>  </h3><p> A successful website can fulfill a simple role such as impressing people that were referred to you and motivating them to take next step. Even if that was its only role and your website performed and it did that well, you&rsquo;d have a high return on your investment. In addition to that, if you&rsquo;re not receiving as many referrals as you&rsquo;d like, a really good website will help. A successful website can also be one that attracts ideal prospects to your website and influences them to the point where they contact you. This initial attraction strategy can be achieved via search engine optimization, social networking, public relations, direct advertising, online ads, print ads, media ads email campaigns and personal introductions. Remember, there&rsquo;s no point in having traffic if your site doesn&rsquo;t cut it. In my opinion, the best tactics for increasing visibility are having great content (papers, posts, checklists, etc), getting your content online (website, blog, content hubs), and then sharing via your social networks. Public relations would be a good add-on here too.</p><p> Just a quick additional note on Search Engine Optimization (SEO). I&rsquo;m seeing an increasing and alarming trend where SEO &ldquo;experts&rdquo; build financial sites that have content that is clearly geared for SEO effectiveness &ldquo;only&rdquo;. Things like repeating key words again and again in the content and again and again in the footer and even again and again in the sidebars. This SEO technique may actually work (until Google changes it&rsquo;s algorithm again), but, there is no point having &ldquo;traffic&rdquo; and &ldquo;SEO visibility&rdquo; if clients or prospects are disinterested because, quite frankly, the website isn&rsquo;t compelling. Hopefully this is a trend that will fade into the background over the next few years. Nothing beats SEO more than &ldquo;real&rdquo;, valuable and fresh content.</p><h3> #8 &ndash; Lacks Visuals <br/>  </h3><p> As mentioned in #4, showing how you are different and/or better is huge to having marketing success. I&rsquo;ve mentioned it again because there&rsquo;s a specific &ldquo;how we do it&rdquo; that needs to be addressed. People like processes, it breeds confidence; it says, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve done this before&rdquo;. It also helps people understand what is being done so they feel informed. Lastly, when you make the &ldquo;how&rdquo; visual, it really helps people connect with it. I highly recommend using visuals (diagrams, videos, infographics) to describe how and what you do.</p><h3> #9 &ndash; Lacks Mobile Readiness <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s expected that mobile viewing of one&rsquo;s website will surpass desktop viewing within a few years. If your website is meant to impress on a desktop or laptop, it ought to achieve the same results on a mobile phone or tablet. We&rsquo;ve written about Responsive vs. Adaptive Mobile Designs previously.</p><h3> #10 &ndash; Lacks Creativity <br/>  </h3><p> Websites are an incredible tool to build your brand and grow your business. It&rsquo;s a huge opportunity to be creative and stand out yet I mostly see safe and common approaches to website design, development and deployment. I also see the same stock imagery used over and over again. Creativity is not just a website vendor problem, this is an industry-wide problem (PS: stop blaming compliance). We&rsquo;re starting to see firms escape the mundane and stand out but we&rsquo;re a long way from competing with leading mainstream marketing engines like Apple and Nike. Not that being marketing pioneers should be a goal for this industry. I should add that I&rsquo;ve seen some incredible retail financial sites that are indeed leading edge &ndash; just not for traditional financial services firms.</p><h3> You be the judge <br/>  </h3><p> Given the above, take a look at your firm&rsquo;s website:</p><li> Does it speak to your audience?</li><li> Does it look current?</li><li> Is it mobile friendly (or does it even work at all in mobile)?</li><li> Are there engagement pieces (beyond your phone number)?</li><li> Does it differentiate you from &ldquo;the guy down the block&rdquo;?</li><p> Fortunately for you, not everyone that reads this article and assigns themselves a failing grade will do something about it. There remains a significant competitive edge for financial firms that want to reach out and position themselves. The time to change has never been better.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-29 17:26:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-29 17:26:15.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_XWD8y52.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-reasons-your-advisor-website-needs-a-big-makeover/\", \"post_id\": \"12152\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-29 17:26:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-29 17:26:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-reasons-your-advisor-website-needs-a-big-makeover\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12151\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5901\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10-Reasons-Your-Advisor-Website-Needs-a-Big-Makeover.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"459\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467284400,"author_id":284,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5669,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Healthy Habits for How to Age Gracefully","link":"healthy-habits-for-how-to-age-gracefully","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Everyone wants to age gracefully. But whether or not you do is mostly based on the choices of nutritious meals, physical activities, and health care checkups. <br/>  </h3><p> Like most people, you do not delight in the thought of getting older because of the aches and pains, forgetfulness, and loneliness. The state of aging is normal, and we do not have to dread it (all the time).</p><p> It's never too late to achieve wellness on both physical and mental levels. In fact, many continue to get better as they age. I've seen images and videos of men, age 80 and up, running races and marathons and women, age 90, doing yoga and swimming. So, we have no excuse to sit around and grow complacent.</p><p> Keeping up with the health necessities and objectives can overwhelm a person. There's a need for regular health check-ups, treatments, medications, and routine health maintenance which can turn into a full-time job.</p><h3> Here's a list of reminders and things to do that relate to health requirements: <br/>  </h3><p> 1. Get medical checkups - Take advantage of the free medical checkups and physicals offered by Medicare all through the first 12 months upon joining the insurance program. After that, you (a senior) receive free annual wellness office visits. From the free assessment, you'll be given a clear direction on what's needed and learn your capabilities.</p><p> 2. Target prevention - Medicare pays for preventive health screenings for the heart, cholesterol, colon cancer and sugar levels. Get pneumonia and influenza vaccinations during these health check-ups.</p><p> 3. Manage medications - During the office visits, share your prescription and over the counter drugs with the physician. If you have questions about drug interactions, symptoms, and allergic reactions, it's the time to ask.</p><p> 4. Go to the Dentist - It's important to keep the gums and teeth clean and healthy. Mouth conditions show evidence of severe health problems like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Get a regular dental check-up every six months.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> 5. Vision and eye exam - If you wear prescription glasses, it's important to make sure it's up to date. If not, the risk of a fall heightens. Screenings also examine eye health.</p><p> 6. Mental Health - Stay mentally active by doing crossword puzzles and hobbies you enjoy. Continue to read and write. These activities motivate and engage the brain.</p><p> 7. Fitness - Exercise increases energy and memory. By taking a walk and moving around, you'll lessen the risk of depression.</p><p> 8. Eat nourishing foods - Because the body slows down with age, eat plenty of high-fiber fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Be sure to stay hydrated because drinking water increases energy.</p><p> 9.

{"original_id":5670,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Gossip! Top 5 Tips for Workplace Success","link":"dont-gossip-top-5-tips-for-workplace-success","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Have you ever wondered why some people have more success in their jobs and others can&rsquo;t seem to get ahead even though they are very smart? <br/>  </h3><p> According to a Harvard University study, 85% of a person&rsquo;s workplace success is due to their personal skills &ndash; those intangible skills that lead to better and smoother relationships with others &ndash; your coworkers, boss or employees.</p><p> It often doesn&rsquo;t take much to be more accomplished and regarded in the workplace.</p><h3> Follow these five tips to help you be your best: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> It may seem like a silly thing, but when you say thank you to others it shows you appreciate their efforts.</p><p> Start by showing gratitude to your coworkers. Write a handwritten thank you note to a colleague who helped you with a project. Or thank that person for his help in a meeting.</p><p> If you manage a staff, express your appreciation for their hard work. The number one reason people leave jobs is they don&rsquo;t feel valued and recognized for their contributions. It doesn&rsquo;t take much to recognize your employees &ndash; a handwritten note, acknowledgement in a staff meeting, or lunch out are all appreciated gestures. I remember getting flowers with appreciative notes from my boss&rsquo;s boss when I worked at WaMu. Those flowers were like gold to me.</p><p> Express thanks to your manager. It&rsquo;s easy to be critical of a boss, but stop for a moment and think about the demands of being a manager. It&rsquo;s not an easy job. Find something you appreciate about your superior and let her or him know.</p><p> Lastly, say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; when anyone does something nice for you. Your appreciation will go far.</p><h3> 2. Be courteous <br/>  </h3><p> Another way to stand out as a great coworker is to be respectful of the people you work with. Clean up after yourself in the kitchen or breakroom. Put your dishes in the dishwasher and wipe the counter. If you take the last cup of coffee make a new pot.</p><p> Be thoughtful of others by keeping your voice down when talking in your cubicle or around others who are working.</p><p> Show up on time to meetings rather than keeping people waiting for you or disturbing the meeting.</p><p> Being courteous also means taking responsibility for problems such as the copier jam your document caused. If you can&rsquo;t fix it, notify someone who can. Don&rsquo;t leave the jam for someone else to repair.</p><h3> 3. Acknowledge others <br/>  </h3><p> You may feel someone is not important to your career, but you never know when that person may be in a position to help you. And, your kindness will be memorable.</p><p> Start your (and their) day off right by acknowledging the people you work with. In the morning, say hello to the folks you see as you walk to your desk. Greet people as you pass them in the hall. It may seem like a small thing, but I guarantee that people notice when you don&rsquo;t do this.</p><p> In his book It Worked for Me, former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell shared a story about visiting the White House garage. When he showed up, the garage attendants thought he was lost and asked him if he needed help getting back &ldquo;home.&rdquo; He said he wasn&rsquo;t lost, he just wanted to chat. After a bit, he asked the attendants how they decided which cars got parked deeper inside the garage and which were parked towards the entrance to get out first. &ldquo;They gave each other knowing looks and little smiles. &lsquo;Mr. Secretary,&rsquo; one of them said, &lsquo;it goes like this: When you drive in, if you lower the window, look out, smile, or know our name, you&rsquo;re number one to get out. But if you look straight ahead, don&rsquo;t show you see us or that we are doing something for you, well, you are likely to be one of the last to get out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re interacting with the janitor or the CEO; everyone desires and deserves to be acknowledged.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Give credit <br/>  </h3><p> When you are praised for a project you led or participated in, be sure to give credit to those you worked with on the assignment. It&rsquo;s always more impressive when someone credits others rather than taking the recognition themselves.</p><p> In a previous job, our division chief would always deflect the credit he received for the various initiatives he oversaw and would praise those who worked on the project. His humility and recognition made him a respected and admired leader.</p><p> Never take credit for a project or idea that wasn&rsquo;t yours. The person or people who were involved in the task or who shared the idea will not think highly of you for your deceit.</p><h3> 5. Don&rsquo;t gossip <br/>  </h3><p> Working with people who are different from you can be challenging, but sharing your negative thoughts about others with your colleagues is never productive and can often come back to hurt you. Many people feel that if you&rsquo;re gossiping with them you&rsquo;re also gossiping about them. If you need to vent, do so at home with your spouse or close trusted friend.</p><p> Gossip can affect company morale. While initially gossip may be exciting, it sets a negative tone and creates a very toxic environment.</p><p> Gossip can also sink a company. There are things that should never be shared &ndash; product launches, mergers, or anything confidential about the company.</p><p> These five steps may seem like common sense, but too often they are not commonly practiced. When you are thoughtful and kind to the people you work with, your working relations will be easier and more productive. This ultimately will help you be more successful in your career.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-29 17:44:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-29 17:44:36.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_qgytkow.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-gossip-top-5-tips-for-workplace-success/\", \"post_id\": \"12156\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-29 17:44:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-29 17:44:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-gossip-top-5-tips-for-workplace-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12155\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5903\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dont-Gossip-Top-5-Tips-for-Workplace-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"943\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467313200,"author_id":44,"chart_url":""}

You will gain far more business than you can ever lose when focusing on women. <br/>  </li><p> That being said, there are really two ways to go. If you already have a clearly defined market and have built your business and reputation for this market, then making women a secondary market would be your best approach.

Remember if you say you focus on women then you must prove it.</p><p> Or perhaps you are like most advisors with a hodgepodge of clients with no real message, brand or focus to your business. If this is you then making women your primary market and focus can be highly productive. This primary focus may feel like a scarier route as you must put your new messaging about women front and center on your homepage, but as you develop your brand, message and new process you will begin to gain more clarity, focus, direction while inspiring more interest and attracting more clients.</p><p> Whatever path you choose, as you begin to uncover and share your purpose for focusing on women you will immediately intrigue and attract more interest in your business from both genders.</p><p> Signed, <br/> Adri</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-29 17:48:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-29 17:48:57.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_YsKX0xu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/as-an-advisor-can-women-be-a-secondary-market/\", \"post_id\": \"12158\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-29 17:48:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-29 17:48:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"as-an-advisor-can-women-be-a-secondary-market\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12157\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5904\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/As-an-Advisor-Can-Women-Be-a-Secondary-Market.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"503\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467288000,"author_id":5,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5672,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Brexit Will Fail... For [at least] Ten Reasons","link":"brexit-will-fail-for-at-least-ten-reasons","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keithwms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Keith Williams </a></p><p> British PM David Cameron's spectacularly ill-conceived referendum on EU membership is highly unlikely to lead to actual  Brexit . Here are ten reasons why:</p><li> <strong>  The terms of the referendum were incorrect, from inception. </strong>  Foremost, simple majority is far too small to provide potential Brexit leaders the kind of political cover that they need to carry out such a difficult shift in policy.  <strong>  Parliamentary procedure typically requires a   supermajority   -either 2/3, 55% or similar- for any decisions that fundamentally affect governance. </strong>  For this reason alone, the British parliament could, and probably should, set the vote aside. In fact,  <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a petition to require a supermajority, as well as 75% turnout </a> , has gathered more than three million signatures as of this writing,  far  exceeding the threshold for consideration by Parliament.(Ironically, that petition was conceived by a  Leave  campaigner.)  <strong>  The supermajority standard is not arbitrary: substantial changes in governance are inherently difficult; hence leaders   need   (and should indeed want) a clear and overarching mandate. </strong>  Lacking a supermajority, leaders tend to face no-confidence motions on a routine basis. <br/>  </li><li> After the vote,  <strong>  PM Cameron made it clear that he will pass the task of triggering Article 50 (concerning secession from the EU) to his successor. </strong>  As noted by many, this is a very poison pill, because that successor must thus inherit market turmoil and all of the other short-term effects. It is very unlikely that  Leave leadership will retain any reasonable level of public confidence while exercising the Article.  <strong>  Without clear confidence, the new government will fall. Repeatedly. </strong> <br/>  </li><li> Numerous details have emerged since the vote, including  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA3XTYfzd1I\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  misstatements regarding NHS financial inputs </a>  and  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-25/brexit-leaders-prepare-to-disappoint-supporters-on-migration\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [im]migration policy </a> .  <strong>  Galling admissions by   Leave   leaders such as Nigel Farage will fatally undermine the credibility of subsequent leadership </strong>  and contribute to (2)...making it almost impossible for a hypothetical  Leave  PM to actually execute separation from the EU. <br/>  </li><li> The referendum vote isolated London and exposed a very strong regional divide between England (outside London), Scotland, and Northern Ireland. So enormous is the difference of opinion across that border that  <strong>  Scottish independence is again on the table </strong> : Scotland certainly wants to remain within the EU. Thus  <strong>  the United Kingdom will formally disintegrate, should Brexit actually occur. </strong>  That prospect alone  is sufficient to turn popular support very strongly against a new, post-Cameron government. <br/>  </li><li> Leave  advocates (and some  Remain  advocates too) have tried to assuage the public's fears by implying that the separation from the EU would take place over ~two years.  That is almost certainly incorrect:  <strong>  the markets could not possibly wait for two years for certainty </strong> . A two-year period of uncertainty would be fatal to the British economy, and quite possibly the Euro economy as a whole. Hence... <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  The countries intending to remain within the EU will press for immediate separation of Britain </strong> , even as current and new British leadership cry \"not so fast.\" It is clearly in the EU's interest to press for immediate separation, even before various trade and immigration agreements are reached. This is for at least two reasons:- (i) to tamp down market uncertainty; and, perhaps more importantly, (ii) to set a very clear precedent that warns other member states (e.g. the Netherlands) of the consequences of exiting the EU.  <strong>  Britain is to be made an harsh example, to make it difficult for fringe leaders like Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen to build upon the Brexit result. </strong> <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Financial markets tend to act in accordance with Newton's Third Law. </strong>  The British trade imbalance has been cited repeatedly by  Leave  campaigners as evidence that the EU needs Britain more than vice versa.  <strong>  However, that trade deficit was computed in terms of pre-Brexit currency. The currency will rebalance, as will the trade, and Britons will find themselves, overnight, with a drastically weaker currency </strong> . That will quickly erase the trade deficit and leave Britain in a very weak position. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  [Im]migration was given far too little attention in the debates prior to the Brexit referendum. </strong>  After the referendum, Britons are learning that they have strongly benefited by the [im]migration of many young and educated Europeans to the UK, as well as departure of older Britons to the south.  <strong>  Brexit would cut off critical channels of immigration and leave England with an aging workforce that saps their entitlement accounts.  </strong> Those seeking good prospects will simply depart England. <br/>  </li><li> The \"Norway Model\" has been cited as one possible outcome of the referendum. However,  <strong>  Norway is vicariously subject to various EU regulations, even though it has little voice or no in their determination. Such an outcome would clearly be unacceptable to the majority of Britain, as it amounts to taxation without representation. </strong> <br/>  </li><li> There are two kinds of immigration into Britain, but  Leave  campaigners have carelessly lumped them together.  It has now become clear that  <strong>  Leave   campaigners have wielded a Trump-esque, xenophobic ploy to block   certain kinds of immigration   (ahem) rather than present a rational economic strategy concerning immigration as a whole. </strong>  In actual fact,  <strong>  Britain desperately needs the inflow of young educated talent from other parts of Europe </strong> , and that will be crimped off, should Britain actually leave the EU. In fact, record numbers of Britons have already applied for Irish passports, in the hours and days following the referendum. They will consider immigration to Scotland as well, should a second Scottish referendum occur and succeed.  <strong>  The result would be an exodus of youth, at a time when post-Baby-Boom Britain can least afford it. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> In summary, numerous  very  difficult obstacles remain, any of which are individually sufficient to block or at least delay  Brexit . However, a delay would be financially fatal; the  <strong>  markets will demand clarity, immediately </strong> .

Their ability won&rsquo;t hold them back &ndash; they&rsquo;re all very talented, smart, and hungry to learn. Their desire won&rsquo;t hold them back &ndash; most of them want to make a difference. Their work ethic won&rsquo;t hold them back &ndash; they&rsquo;re doing what it takes and putting in the time.  What I see as their biggest obstacle is that they don&rsquo;t trust themselves. They&rsquo;re playin&rsquo; it safe.</p><h3> Our biggest obstacle is that we don&rsquo;t trust ourselves. We play it safe. <br/>  </h3><p> So many of us move up in our careers because we&rsquo;ve done a good job executing what our bosses ask of us.  We absorb feedback from our managers and mentors, and work hard to be what we think is expected of us (often replicas of the people at the helm).  We learn the right things to say (and maybe more importantly, what not to say).  We learn how we&rsquo;re &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to carry ourselves.  We learn how to play the game. And we get quite good at it.  We move up the ladder.  We get bigger, fancier titles and more responsibility.  As more and more people begin reporting to us, we pass down the rules of the game and reward the players who follow the rules.  And so the story goes on.</p><p> What I&rsquo;ve come to discover is that there&rsquo;s so much more to all of us than this story allows us to see. In our quest for success, we often mask off the best of who we are in order to fit an automaton-image of what we think is expected. And while that may serve us up to a point, as Marshall Goldsmith would say, What Got You Here Won&rsquo;t Get You There.</p><h3> We often mask off the best of who we are in order to fit an automaton-image of what we think is expected. <br/>  </h3><p> There comes a time, as we mature in our careers and move into positions of influence and leadership, that require us to do more than follow the rules that have been laid out before us like a prescription to success.   When our jobs shift from executing tasks to leading people we can no longer afford to play it safe as the stakes are too high.  If we need the people we lead to want to follow &ndash; to invest their emotional energy (passion, excitement, loyalty, creativity, trust, etc) into being and bringing their best &ndash; then we need to put more skin in the game.</p><h3> If we want people to invest their emotional energy, we need to put more skin in the game. <br/>  </h3><p> In the theatre, when an actor on stage is worrying about what others think, trying to impress, trying to be perfect, they cannot focus on igniting action in the scene that is unfolding. They are not fully invested in the moment. It&rsquo;s incredibly scary to be all-in on stage. You have to trust yourself. You have to trust that if you go there, the by-product will be an electrifying performance. But if you play it safe, if you don&rsquo;t go there, you can be sure that what you&rsquo;ll deliver is milk-toast at best. For an actor, anything but 100% commitment to playing full out is the most dangerous thing you can do.</p><p> I believe that&rsquo;s true for leadership as well.</p><h3> Playing it safe is the most dangerous thing you can do. <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you say whatever you want to say and do whatever you want to do with abandon, it&rsquo;s critical to pay attention to the impact you&rsquo;re having. But I am saying that playing it safe will only get us so far.  If when you&rsquo;re presenting you&rsquo;re more worried about the right way to hold your hands and if your PowerPoint slides are perfect than you are in connecting to the hearts and minds of your audience, then don&rsquo;t be surprised if their hearts and minds aren&rsquo;t engaged. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If when you&rsquo;re at a meeting you&rsquo;re holding back your opinions and ideas to not rock the boat instead of finding constructive ways to get your opinions and ideas heard, don&rsquo;t be surprised if you find yourself disengaged. And can we afford that? Can we afford the people we lead to not engage? Can we afford our own disengagement? As a leader, isn&rsquo;t that the most dangerous thing we could do?</p><h3> Can we afford the people we lead to not engage? Can we afford our own disengagement? <br/>  </h3><p> Ask yourself, where in your life are you not playing full out? What&rsquo;s the price you&rsquo;re paying for playin&rsquo; it safe?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 15:07:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 15:07:05.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_MFFYYgq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-biggest-obstacle-to-becoming-an-emerging-leader-playing-it-safe/\", \"post_id\": \"12162\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 15:07:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 15:07:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-biggest-obstacle-to-becoming-an-emerging-leader-playing-it-safe\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12161\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5906\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Biggest-Obstacle-to-Becoming-an-Emerging-Leader-Playing-It-Safe.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"718\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467392400,"author_id":281,"chart_url":""}

By that we mean MRFPs, financial statements, monthly, quarterly and semi-annual commentaries, and annual reports. If so, you know that timelines are tight and extra rounds of review can derail the project.</p><p> To help you make the process as efficient as possible, we&rsquo;ve put together a list of seven tips that could save you hours. They&rsquo;re easy to implement and you&rsquo;ll see results immediately.</p><h3> 1. Know your benchmarks <br/>  </h3><p> A fund&rsquo;s official benchmark may not be the one that your portfolio manager used during the period, especially if it is sub-advised. Getting that right before reviews is an easy win.</p><h3> 2. Heads up! <br/>  </h3><p> Let everyone &ndash; portfolio managers, analysts, project managers and your compliance team &ndash; know their timelines well in advance, and then remind them again a few days before the process gets underway.</p><h3> 3. Use the right language <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t send copy to compliance that won&rsquo;t be accepted. That means removing investing jargon and overly technical terms like &ldquo;risk on/risk off,&rdquo; &ldquo;headwind/tailwind,&rdquo; &ldquo;hawkish/dovish&rdquo; and &ldquo;when rates backed up.&rdquo; We can help you find suitable alternatives that an average investor would understand.</p><h3> 4. Think about repetition <br/>  </h3><p> Does every single fund need a different outlook? It&rsquo;s important to spend some time on that question because if you choose &ldquo;No&rdquo; you could cut down on a significant amount of work by repurposing copy.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 5. Shorter is better <br/>  </h3><p> Tight copy that gets to the point will always win. Your readers will appreciate your brevity if it helps them get a better picture of what happened over the period. </p><h3> 6. Know your reporting period <br/>  </h3><p> Six-month marketing commentaries and MRFPs can be a problem because investment teams are more familiar with quarterly and annual reviews. In your communications leading up to the project, explain the time period in bold typeface.</p><h3> 7. Create a style guide <br/>  </h3><p> Does your firm write sector names with an uppercase or lowercase letter (e.g., the Energy sector or the energy sector)? Does your firm use a serial comma or not? If everyone is on the same page, reviewing will take less time. </p><p> There you have it: seven simple ideas that can save you hours.

{"original_id":5675,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Achieve Your Goals When Improving Customer Experience","link":"how-to-achieve-your-goals-when-improving-customer-experience","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Which metrics have you selected to track your customer experience improvement efforts? <br/>  </h3><p> I've got a lot of questions about the metric(s) you've chosen to measure customer sentiment about the experience with your company and to track your progress toward improving that experience. <br/> <br/> For starters: How did you select the metric? Was it based on a desired business outcome? Was it based on a desired customer outcome? Did a consultant tell you to use that one? Did you read about it in a book or hear about it at a conference? Was there some clear basis for selecting the metric? <br/> <br/> And then: Why? What do you do with that metric? Track it? Focus on it? Figure out how to move the needle on the metric? Make it all about the metric? <br/> <br/> Have you ever heard of Goodhart&rsquo;s Law? It states: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. <br/>  </p><p> According to Wikipedia, its origin lies in finance and economics:</p><p> \"The original formulation by Goodhart, a former advisor to the Bank of England and Emeritus Professor at the London School of Economics, is this: &ldquo;As soon as the government attempts to regulate any particular set of financial assets, these become unreliable as indicators of economic trends.&rdquo; This is because investors try to anticipate what the effect of the regulation will be, and invest so as to benefit from it.\"</p><p> According to AdExchanger, the most-often cited example of Goodhart's Law is from a nail factory in the Soviet Union:</p><p> \"The goal of central planners was to measure the performance of the factories, so factory operators were given targets around the number of nails produced. To meet and exceed the targets, factory operators produced millions of tiny, useless nails. When targets were switched to the total weight of nails produced, operators instead produced several enormous, heavy and useless nails. <br/> <br/> \"The above example is absurd, but illustrates the point: When a measure of performance is the same as the target, it can be abused to the point of no longer being useful in measuring the desired outcome.\"</p><p> My fear is that too many focus on making useless nails in order to simply achieve the target. Unfortunately, this is one of the pitfalls of NPS. The target, not the customer and his desired outcome, becomes the focus. Moving the needle is what it's all about, at all costs. <br/> <br/> When it was first introduced, and still today, the beauty of NPS was that it gets executives focused on the customer experience. The problem is, many simply focused on NPS. The directive became: Identify the benchmark! Tell me what our competitors' scores are! Beat them! <br/> <br/> While metrics can focus the organization on the customer and the customer experience, that can only happen if the metrics are presented in the right context - and they're not made the focus or the goal but simply a way to measure progress.</p><p> In order to do that, you'll need to...</p><li> talk about the score in context, i.e., talk about what it means relative to the customer and the customer experience</li><li> avoid gaming surveys (selecting certain customers, surveying at a specific time when you know scores will be better, offering incentives a la &ldquo;the car dealer curse,&rdquo; etc.) just to get a score</li><li> model appropriate behavior that leads to improved customer experiences - and, ultimately, an improved score</li><li> reward and recognize behavior and experiences that your customers want and prefer</li><li> compensate based on improving the experience, not the score</li><li> dig deeper and get at what's behind the metric</li><li> think strategy, not tactics, in order to improve the experience overall</li><li> have an action plan for improvement - talk about it and own it</li><p> Listen to customers. Understand customers, their needs, and what they are trying to achieve. Fix the things that your customers tell you are wrong. Know what their desired outcomes are but also know the business' desired outcomes. Then use the metric to measure progress - each customer and yours.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 15:28:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 15:28:53.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_k1F4nML.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-achieve-your-goals-when-improving-customer-experience/\", \"post_id\": \"12166\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 15:28:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 15:28:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-achieve-your-goals-when-improving-customer-experience\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12165\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5908\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Achieve-Your-Goals-When-Improving-Customer-Experience.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"474\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467367200,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

I was the only woman on our entire team of 50. As this was one of my first real jobs, it was also my first opportunity to start investing in my 401(k). I was smart enough to know that putting money aside for retirement was something that I needed to do. The only problem was, I had no clue  what  I was supposed to invest in!</p><p> The irony of the situation is not lost on me. Here I was, working in finance, at an investment bank, no less, and yet I really didn&rsquo;t understand how to manage my own personal portfolio. Like a lot of women, I lacked confidence in my own financial skills, and was intimidated by the idea of learning how to invest. For advice, I turned to the more seasoned finance professionals around me,  all  men. They told me what to invest in, and I blindly followed their advice. Truthfully, the returns weren&rsquo;t terrible, but I regretTed following the lead of others without taking the time to educate myself.</p><p> This moment proved to be a distinct turning point in my career. The embarrassment of walking into my colleagues&rsquo; offices to ask them what I should do with  my  money did not sit well with me. I decided that I needed to take ownership of my personal finances. Shortly thereafter, I began studying to become a certified financial planner, and over time, developed confidence in my financial knowledge and ability to handle my own financial affairs.</p><p> It can be intimidating for us women to operate in what we perceive to be a man&rsquo;s world, and certainly, finance sure feels like a man&rsquo;s world. However, with women having more education, status and money than ever, it is even more important that we develop an understanding of personal finance, investing, and retirement planning. Unfortunately, women lack confidence in their financial acumen. A  <a href=\"https://www.ml.com/articles/women-and-investing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  study </a>  by Merrill Lynch found that 55% of women surveyed believe that they &ldquo;know less than the average investor about financial markets and investing in general&rdquo;, as compared to only 27% of men who feel this way.

However, it is critically important to work toward gaining a better understanding. This is especially true for women who are receiving financial advice from others. It can be very tempting to ask for financial advice and simply take your adviser&rsquo;s word for it&ndash;and there are advisers out there who still operate under the assumption that this is the kind of service women want. However, women need to feel comfortable asking questions in order to understand the reasoning behind the advice.</p><p> What&rsquo;s not OK?

{"original_id":5677,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Smart Ways To Improve Company Culture","link":"5-smart-ways-to-improve-company-culture","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Andy Crebar</p><p> Improving company culture has quickly become a non-negotiable for modern leaders at growth-focused organizations - 90 percent of executives believe  <a href=\"http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/news_events/news-releases/corporate-culture/#.V1NLXfkrJhE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  culture is important </a> , and only 15 percent think their culture is where it needs to be.</p><p> In these competitive times, having a great product, process or game plan isn&rsquo;t enough. What&rsquo;s at the heart of your business? Your people. And its company culture that drives people engagement and productivity.</p><p> So what can you do to improve your organizational culture? Below we&rsquo;ve compiled the top 5 tips, covering everything from values alignment and feedback to flexible workspaces and team success.</p><h3> Align Company Culture with Company Values</h3><p> <br/> Your company&rsquo;s values are the guiding principles by which your people should operate.</p><p> Holly Lebowtiz Rossi at Fortune gave an insightful <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/03/13/company-slogans/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   rundown of great value statements </a>  &lsquo;that play an active role in business practice and foster confidence and happiness in the employees who work with the values every day.&rsquo;</p><p> Defining your core values is at the  <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/revamp-your-talent-acquisition-strategy-to-attract-millennials\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  heart of employer branding </a> , and would be a whole article in itself. For now, we&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;ve got these tenets in place &ndash; how do you link them to the everyday culture of your workplace?</p><p> You need to break them down into their impact at the employee level. Are you offering rapid turnaround projects focused on short term outcomes? Give your employees what they need to work efficiently and reward them for the daily milestones they have to achieve.</p><p> Or maybe your organization operates in a slow moving industry with advantages in level-headed, blue sky thinking &ndash; in this case, can you tweak the environment to ensure that they are in the right frame of mind?</p><p> Equally, if you&rsquo;re a bunch of alternative, creative types who will work best bouncing ideas off each other, have a company culture that facilitates this: promote collaborative efforts and have sociable breakout spaces.  </p><h3> Encourage Flexibility</h3><p> <br/> Regardless of a company&rsquo;s values, modern employees see flexibility as one of the biggest factors affecting their experience at work, driving retention, engagement and productivity.</p><p> Regus reports a  <a href=\"http://www.regus.com/images/Flexibility%20Drives%20Productivity_tcm8-49367.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  70% increase in productivity </a>  for companies that have moved to flexible working practices. It doesn&rsquo;t have to mean letting employees rock up at 11am every day when your clients are expecting a call at half past 8, but it might make sense to incorporate whatever changes your business model allows.</p><p> If you can offer opportunities to work remotely, consider options of part-time roles or job sharing, or offer sabbaticals for dedicated workers who need a break, you will reap the rewards of a more highly-motivated workforce.</p><p> The more options you can provide; the more likely you find arrangements that will benefit employee well-being and support overall  <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/overcoming-employee-engagement-challenges\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  employee engagement </a> .</p><h3> Be Clear and Transparent</h3><p> <br/> A company&rsquo;s direction comes from the top, but the momentum to get there is all about the efforts of your employees.</p><p> As such, it&rsquo;s crucial to be clear in the messages you&rsquo;re sending out from the highest level, and have a company culture where this information is valued, discussed, and understood. The first opportunity to do this is during the  <a href=\"https://www.trysapling.com/employee-onboarding/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  employee onboarding </a>  process.</p><p> Share everything you can that might add value and help people become part of the tribe - make sure they can leverage institutional knowledge and resources as soon as possible.</p><h3> Listen to Employee Feedback</h3><p> <br/> So you have your values, you&rsquo;ve communicated them clearly and shown where they come from&hellip;what&rsquo;s next?  You need to listen to the thoughts of your colleagues and take into account their suggestions.</p><p> Regular, timely and constructive feedback is the best way to improve performance, whether that&rsquo;s the performance of your employees or of your company as a whole.</p><p> Ensure your organizational culture allows everyone to feel comfortable giving both  <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/boost-employee-training-with-actionable-constructive-feedback\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  positive and constructive feedback </a> .</p><p> You can implement this in a number of ways beyond the traditional, anonymous suggestion box, like transparent flowcharts, feedback coaches and the all-important follow up meeting where you actually show how you&rsquo;ve handled their ideas.</p><h3> Embrace Success as a Team Sport</h3><p> <br/> If you celebrate successes as a team, you are better placed to tackle challenges as a team.</p><p> Engaged employees who feel a part of a high-performing team are  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/services/191489/q12-meta-analysis-report-2016.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  21% more productive </a> . Sharing responsibility and recognition for company accomplishments will empower employees to help others, all for the good of the organization.</p><p> The change here is primarily a mental shift, but you may need also to change the structure of how you collaborate and reward efforts.</p><p> Any technology or software that encourages collaboration and offers team buy-in for activities from brainstorming sessions to welcoming new starters can help foster this culture.</p><h3> How You Can Take These Tips On Board</h3><p> <br/> Building a great company culture doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight, and 87% of organizations cite  <a href=\"http://dupress.com/articles/employee-engagement-culture-human-capital-trends-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  culture and employee engagement </a>  as their top challenges.</p><p> But you can take the first steps towards a better employee environment by simply talking openly with employees. All of these tips - values, flexibility, transparency, feedback and team success - start with a conversation.</p><p> Even a small shift in mentality can make a big difference in achieving a company culture that drives real employee engagement and general employee experience success.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 15:47:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 15:47:08.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_WPeqZ21.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-smart-ways-to-improve-company-culture/\", \"post_id\": \"12170\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 15:47:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 15:47:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-smart-ways-to-improve-company-culture\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12169\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5910\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5-Smart-Ways-To-Improve-Company-Culture.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"783\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467399600,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5678,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"New Proposed SEC Rule Could Require RIA Business Continuity Plans","link":"new-proposed-sec-rule-could-require-ria-business-continuity-plans","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  RIA in a Box </a></p><p> This week the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-133.html\" target=\"_blank\">  issued a release </a>  announcing the proposal of a new rule that would &ldquo;require registered investment advisers to adopt and implement written business continuity and transition plans.&rdquo; The rule would apply to registered investment adviser (RIA) firms registered at the federal level and comes a year after after the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) released a similar  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/nasaa-passes-rule-for-ria-business-continuity-and-succession-planning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  model rule for investment adviser business continuity and succession planning </a> . </p><p> Previously, we have discussed other SEC rule proposals regarding new policies and procedures and disclosure requirements including those which would  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/the-sec-is-proposing-that-rias-disclose-additional-branch-office-data\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  require additional information about investment adviser branch offices to be disclosed </a> . In this post, we take a closer look at the SEC's proposed rule on business continuity and transition plans which reflects the agency's continued application of the fiduciary standard in light of new and emerging risks.</p><p> Although the SEC has previously stated that it expects investment advisory firms to have robust business continuity plans in effect today as part of a firm's fiduciary obligation, this new proposed rule would formalize the requirement and provide more prescriptive guidance as to what should be included in such plans. Specifically, the new proposed rule  <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2016/ia-4439.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  (file no. S7-13-16 published in the Federal Register </a> ) would require the content of an RIA firm's business continuity and transition plan to address the following components:</p><li> Maintenance of critical operations and systems, and the protection, backup, and recovery of data, including client records;</li><li> Pre-arranged alternative physical location(s) of the adviser's office(s) and/or employees;</li><li> Communications with clients, employees, service providers, and regulators;</li><li> Identification and assessment of third-party services critical to the operation of the adviser; and</li><li> Plan of transition that accounts for the possible winding down of the investment adviser's business or the transition of the investment adviser's business to others in the event the investment adviser is unable to continue providing investment advisory services, that includes the following: <li>  Policies and procedures intended to safeguard, transfer, and/or distribute client assets during transition; </li> <li>  Policies and procedures facilitating the prompt generation of any client-specific information necessary to transition each client account; </li> <li>  Information regarding the corporate governance structure of the adviser; </li> <li>  Identification of any material financial resources available to the adviser; and </li> <li>  An assessment of the applicable law and contractual obligations governing the adviser and its clients, including   <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-2015-nasaa-ria-compliance-deficiencies-pooled-investment-vehicles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pooled investment vehicles  </a>  , implicated by the adviser's transition.  <br/>    </li></li><p> <strong>  As   <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/when-and-when-not-to-work-with-an-ria-compliance-consultant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA compliance consultants  </a>  , we see many investment advisory firms already addressing many of the specific components addressed above, but as the SEC notes, this is still not the case for a significant number of investment advisory firms as outlined on pages 8 and 9 of the proposal: </strong></p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> While we understand that many investment advisers already have taken steps to address and mitigate the risks of business disruptions, our staff has observed a wide range of practices by advisers in addressing operational risk management. The staff frequently observes advisers managing operational and other risks through internal practices, procedures, and controls that are typically assessed by the adviser&rsquo;s legal, compliance, or audit staff, and often sees independent third-party assessments performed by audit or compliance firms. However,  <strong>  the staff also has observed advisers with less robust planning, causing them to experience interruptions in their key business operations and inconsistently maintain communications with clients and employees during periods of stress. As discussed further below, our staff has noted weaknesses in some adviser BCPs with respect to consideration of widespread disruptions, alternate locations, vendor relationships, telecommunications and technology, communications plans, and review and testing. </strong>  Although disparate practices may exist in light of the varying size and complexity of registrants, to effectively mitigate such risks we are proposing to require all SEC-registered investment advisers to have plans that are reasonably designed to address operational and other risks related to a significant disruption in the investment adviser&rsquo;s operations. </p><p> <strong>  In addition, pages 5 and 6 of the proposed rule release further enumerate the SEC's specific concerns: </strong></p><p> Investment advisers today also participate in and are part of an increasingly complex financial services industry. Advisers are relying on technology to a greater extent, managing more complicated portfolios and strategies that often include complex investments, and are increasingly relying on the services of third parties such as custodians, brokers and dealers, pricing services, and technology vendors that support their operations. </p><p> Although the types of registered investment advisers and their business models may vary significantly, they generally share certain fundamental operational risks.  <strong>  Of particular concern to the Commission are those risks that may impact the ability of an adviser and its personnel to continue operations, provide services to clients and investors, or, in certain circumstances, transition the management of accounts to another adviser. </strong>  Such operational risks include, but are not limited to, technological failures with respect to systems and processes (whether proprietary or provided by third-party vendors supporting the adviser&rsquo;s activities), and the loss of adviser or client data, personnel, or access to the adviser&rsquo;s physical location(s) and facilities.</p><p> <strong>  And lastly, pages 9 and 10 once again frame the proposed rule as a logical application of the fiduciary standard: </strong></p><p> Our experience indicates that clients of advisers who do not have robust plans in place to address the operational and other risks related to significant disruptions in their operations are at greater risk of harm during such a disruption than the clients of advisers who do have such plans in place.  <br/> <strong>  As fiduciaries, investment advisers owe their clients a duty of care and a duty of loyalty, requiring them to put their clients&rsquo; interests above their own. As part of their fiduciary duty, advisers are obligated to take steps to protect client interests from being placed at risk as a result of the adviser&rsquo;s inability to provide advisory services. </strong></p><p> This rule proposal has been long anticipated by the industry and the SEC deserves credit for attempting to create enough flexibility in the proposed rule to allow for different levels of robustness dependent upon a firm's size and operational complexity. However, given the significant costs that may be involved for firms to implement these new proposed standards, we advise all investment advisory firm principals to carefully review this rule proposal and considering submitting comments as outlined beginning on page 76 of the rule proposal.</p><p> It's also important to note that should this new rule ultimately go into effect, there will likely be increased time pressure for RIA firm principals to establish formal internal and/or third party succession plans to be prepared for unexpected life events.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 15:55:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 15:55:35.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_OAsKk5i.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/new-proposed-sec-rule-could-require-ria-business-continuity-plans/\", \"post_id\": \"12172\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 15:55:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 15:55:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"new-proposed-sec-rule-could-require-ria-business-continuity-plans\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12171\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5911\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/New-Proposed-SEC-Rule-Could-Require-RIA-Business-Continuity-Plans.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"715\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467360000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

I explained that an ability to achieve results is only a  <i>  part </i>  of the winning equation.  The reporter was shocked and asked me to elaborate.</p><p> I explained that early on, in my career, I believed that results were the end goal, the bottom line.</p><p> Then I met Joe.  He was a top-producer, earning over $3 million per year.  Having earned the achievement of top-producer as well, I got to sit at Joe&rsquo;s table for our exclusive top-producer dinner.  I was thrilled to be given the chance to learn how to achieve better results.</p><p> From the outside, Joe&rsquo;s life was exciting.  He clearly knew how to  <a href=\"http://pma360.com/secret-to-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  achieve results </a> ; he had a big house, big car, and big  <i>  life </i> !  However, it took me just a few minutes to do the math and realize his bottom-line results were not sustainable.  By simply adding the overhead Joe shared, it was clear his business model was not profitable. In fact, a few years later, his business folded.</p><p> Too often, I consult with advisors or consultants who appear at the top of their game.  They are winning all awards and making millions, some even billions. Yet, these &ldquo;successful&rdquo; advisors do not get a passing-grade because they are heading down the wrong road.  They are leaving out key ingredients required to  <a href=\"http://pma360.com/mastermind-group/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  achieve long-term, sustainable results. </a></p><p> Many times, we believe that because we hit a number, we have arrived.  As a top producer for over 20 years, I can attest to how much attention you get when you are you on top.  We get accolades and 5 star treatment while constantly being reminded of how great we are.  It is easy to get caught up in the &ldquo;hitting a number&rdquo; syndrome.</p><p> This spiral can be our demise.</p><p> It is clear the advisors and teams who come to me are not achieving their desired results (why would they be talking with me if they were).  What they are missing is The 3 Step Formula. A Formula which includes their inner game, game plan and outer game.</p><p> To learn how to create your formula, you can attend our mid-year training that we only offer twice a year. You and your team can register <a href=\"http://www.mcssl.com/SecureCart/ViewCart.aspx?mid=D1DCB6C6-FC37-4BD4-9A30-3CFDF51DFE30&amp;sctoken=dda5096dcf04472c95426d81ae868e62&amp;bhjs=1&amp;bhqs=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> (use code PMA97 to attend free):</p><p> Today, I also want to share a few tips on gaining insight to help you get clear on what actions you must take to achieve your desired results.</p><p> The best place to begin is by asking questions.</p><h3> Step #1: Gathering Insight</h3><p> <br/> A few great questions include:</p><li> How many partners are in your firm?</li><li> What is the gross revenue of the firm?</li><li> What is the net profit, after expenses, to each partner?</li><li> What has been your growth pattern over the last 5 years?</li><li> What is your desired revenue/profit? <br/>  </li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to have a Degree in Finance to figure out there&rsquo;s a problem once you get these answers.</p><p> Oftentimes during this question phase, the advisors in most need of a overhaul, resort to sharing their successes, such as media appearances, increases in revenue, company awards, etc.  While these accomplishments are important, they deflect what&rsquo;s really going on and make it difficult, if not impossible, to determine the best course of action.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Step #2: The Plan</h3><p> <br/> The next step towards achieving results requires that you  <a href=\"http://pma360.com/marketing-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  create a plan </a> .  Possible questions to measure success at this step include:</p><li> &ldquo;Do you have a business/marketing plan?&rdquo;</li><li> If you have a plan, a great question is,&ldquo;Do you follow it?</li><li> Do you measure and track your results?&rdquo;  If not, then this is a great starting point. <br/>  </li><p> You also want to know:</p><li> Who is your ideal client?</li><li> What lead-generation strategies do you use?</li><li> Why?</li><li> What strategies do you use to leverage your resources? <br/>  </li><p> Taking the time to create and execute a plan is one of the most critical aspects of a successful business plan.  The most effective plan includes your inner game, game plan &amp; outer game.</p><h3> Step #3 HVFDA Execution</h3><p> <br/> The last step is critical.  You want to ask:</p><li> What consistent daily actions are you completing?</li><li> Are these daily actions producing your desired results?</li><li> How many hours are you spending on your HVFDA (High Value Fixed Daily Activities) and IPA (Income Producing Activities)?</li><li> How did you choose these activities &amp; why? <br/>  </li><p> The answers to these questions will let you know if you&rsquo;re putting forth enough effort to produce your desired results and also shows where improvements should be made.</p><p> By asking more questions, creating your plan and  <a href=\"http://pma360.com/financial-advisor-business-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  monitoring your activities </a> , you will get on track to creating a winning equation. An equation that dramatically increase your odds of earning long-term, sustainable results &ndash; something too many consultants, small business owners and advisors are missing.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 16:08:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 16:08:46.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_oKuV51E.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-how-to-achieve-optimal-results/\", \"post_id\": \"12174\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 16:08:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 16:08:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-how-to-achieve-optimal-results\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12173\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5912\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Advisors-How-To-Achieve-Optimal-Results.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1177\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467370800,"author_id":41,"chart_url":""}

She remembered the short video clip I had shown to illustrate the high cost of seemingly small distractions. (It&rsquo;s a clip of when I won an Olympic medal in the pool by a mere 4/100ths of a second because the swimmer in line for 3rd place turned to look at me with only three strokes left in the race, costing him a medal.) The image stuck in her mind.</p><h3> Are you creating pictures people can easily remember you by? <br/>  </h3><p> Because I provide an image when I talk about distractions, people recall my message more readily during their daily experiences. Every time they hear a sports announcer say, &ldquo;Can you believe how close that was?&rdquo; they remember my presentation about distractions and recall their need to stay focused on what matters most so they can succeed sooner.</p><p> A picture is worth way more than a thousand words. When you link an idea, issue, or threat to a relevant familiar image, people remember you and your point much more easily than they would relying words alone.</p><p> Dave McHugh, a friend and a successful advisor with Edward Jones, used to meet with me when I first started as an advisor at Morgan Stanley. Dave was working with New York Life back in 2001. The door to my office had two vertical columns of four small window panes. One day Dave described a product that helped with diversification. He glanced at my door, then proceeded to describe how diversification worked by illustrating his point with my door.</p><p> He explained that if one small pane in my door got damaged, only that one piece of glass would need fixing; the whole window would not be ruined like it would be if it were a single, large pane of glass. I used Dave&rsquo;s illustration with my clients. After 15 years, I and many of my clients still remember that image.

Then it is just as important, if not more so, for me to validate my customer&rsquo;s choice to do business with me through what happens after the sale.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the concept of validation for a while. This is where the customers validate your efforts in persuading them to do business with you. Sometimes the pursuit of the customer may include meetings, proposals and various other tasks. Gaining validation with a customer this way may take a year or longer. However, in some cases it happens much faster. For example, in a retail store, it may be what&rsquo;s in the window that captures a new customer&rsquo;s eye. Then a friendly salesperson helps the customer and within minutes the sale is made, making the sale happen almost instantly. Now while this may seem more like a sales concept, stay with me. It&rsquo;s all about customer service and the customer experience.</p><p> The point is that the customer is making a decision based on all types of reasons that can include brand awareness and perception, interactions with people, marketing messages and more. Everything that happens leading up to that first sale is based on the customer&rsquo;s experience. At some point, the customer makes the decision to buy. This is called &ldquo;making the sale.&rdquo; We can also call it &ldquo;validating the effort.&rdquo;</p><p> Then what happens after the sale is the customer service and experience that makes the customer feel like he or she made the right choice, which we can call, &ldquo;validating the choice.&rdquo;</p><p> The point is that the customer experience, which includes customer service, begins long before the sale is made.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Perhaps an overly simplistic way to describe this concept is that it&rsquo;s like a marriage. Two people go out on the first date. If all goes well, it leads to a second date. Then a third, and so on. Then one day before you know it, there&rsquo;s a marriage proposal. Everything up until that proposal was part of the courting stage.</p><p> When the person asking the other to marry him or her gets yes for an answer, it validates the relationship and the effort that was put into it &ndash; from on both sides, by the way. Then once the two get married, either one &ndash; hopefully both &ndash; would look back and say, &ldquo;I made the right decision.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s pretty much the same in business. That period before the sale is the courting stage. The sale is made and the customer will hopefully say the same thing, &ldquo;I made the right decision.&rdquo;</p><p> That&rsquo;s validation. And, it&rsquo;s all about the customer&rsquo;s experience.

I pursued her, though, because I thought she had potential to accumulate much more wealth down the line. During the initial meeting, she bluntly asked in a haughty tone, &ldquo;Sara, if you&rsquo;re also an adjunct professor, why should I choose you over someone who doesn&rsquo;t do anything else during the day but watch my money?  Shouldn&rsquo;t I take them more seriously than you?&rdquo;  This being one of the first sales calls I ever made, I took it a bit personally.  I was put off by how direct she was, and by her icy manner. Moreover, the initial investment amount was well below my minimum.  I was giving her a break by offering to manager her money in the first place!  I wanted to respond back &ldquo;AND WHO ARE YOU WITH YOUR MEAGER LITTLE TWO CENTS NET WORTH?&rdquo; but instead I graciously finished the meeting and retreated home to put together the follow up. </p><p> When I reflected upon the interaction, though, I became courageous.  It hit me that she asked the question because she was curious.  Prospects with no questions aren&rsquo;t going to buy anything from you.  A question indicates interest and that is one of the first steps to making them intrigued by you.  I didn&rsquo;t care for her arrogant tone, but if I got past the subconscious dissonance and stopped focusing on that, I knew there was a way to transform her doubt into a compelling reason to choose me.  My professorship, after all, was something that she recognized as making me different from the rest. </p><p> I worked diligently to prepare an explanation of my approach to money management, citing how strong communication with the client was a focus of my service.  I told her that being a professor, I liked to empower my clients through financial education just as I had done for my students.  She would be my co-pilot, in a sense, as I managed her account.  I offered my ability to connect with my students as an example of my engaging communication skills and even offered them as references.   I explained my in depth process for managing her portfolio risk and how it meant I didn&rsquo;t have to be glued to a screen all day.  All of this managed to turn her confusion into intrigue.  The way I fought to respond well to the question made me win her trust.  She thought about it a while, and eventually decided to work with me.</p><h3> You can&rsquo;t take anything personally in business and in sales.  You cannot blame the client, even subconsciously.  There are no bad questions.  </h3><p> <br/> You have to take every interaction, good or bad, and use it as a tool to your advantage.  Sulking is for wannabe players. The real players will rise up and use resistance as a way to demonstrate the value of what they have to offer.  Do you see how powerful it can be when you can turn things around?  Making a negative into a positive can put you in an even better position than where you started from. </p><p> So they next time you are trying to persuade somebody to do something and they fire a big ugly one back at you, silently the bell of opportunity is ringing.  Every question can be answered in a way that demonstrates your value if you are prepared to show it.  The more probing the question, the deeper the client is asking you to dig, and the more value has the potential to be created.  Be ready to do this (instead of sulking), and you&rsquo;ll gain power in the negotiation.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 16:43:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 16:43:39.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_OXosKYO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-opportunity-that-you-gain-by-not-taking-it-personally/\", \"post_id\": \"12179\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 16:43:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 16:43:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-opportunity-that-you-gain-by-not-taking-it-personally\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12178\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5915\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Opportunity-That-You-Gain-by-Not-Taking-It-Personally.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"626\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467363600,"author_id":424,"chart_url":""}

These then grant the program access to data from one or more social media networks (including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram), which it uses to create a one-time report on the individual. This process scans private conversations and public posts to record information about the user&rsquo;s personality, life events (like giving birth or getting married), and even their &lsquo;financial stress level&rsquo; &mdash; a measure of how easy it is for them to pay their rent, based on the frequency with which keywords like &lsquo;no money,&rsquo; &lsquo;poor,&rsquo; and &lsquo;staying in,&rsquo; appear in their posts.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Suffice it to say, many social media experts challenge &ldquo;personal brand vetting&rdquo; practices like Score Assured, although many of us have been warning our children and adolescents &ldquo;to be cautious about what they post because it can have long-term implications for college admission or future employment.&rdquo;</p><h3> From my perspective, the key lessons from Score Assured are as follows: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Be Careful What You Say On-Line: </strong> You may think your comments are spontaneous and your &ldquo;personal business&rdquo; but in truth, once something enters the social space you never know how it will be used to &ldquo;vet&rdquo; you.</li><li> <strong>  Your Personal Brand Effects Your Business Brand:  </strong> While freedom of speech is an essential tenant of democracy, there is no firewall between what is said in our personal life and how we are viewed professionally.</li><li> <strong>  Much Can Be Learned From &ldquo;Life-casting:&rdquo;  </strong> Granted Tenant Assured has a creepy, lurking quality, but there is much we can learn about our clients based on what they choose to share through social media. Listening to the customer is always a great idea. The challenge is to respectfully listen (in places and in ways in which they want us to take an interest).</li><li> <strong>  Information Is Power That Should Be Used Responsibly: </strong> Like all power, listening can be leveraged for good (e.g. learning about a customer&rsquo;s birthday and authentically acknowledging them) or for bad (choosing to exploit a vulnerability shared online). The way you handle listening will reflect back on your personal and professional brand.</li><p> OK, heeding my own advice, I just re-read this blog and feel comfortable with it representing my personal brand and my business. I&rsquo;ll hit &ldquo;post&rdquo; but who really knows what impact it will have&hellip;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 16:48:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 16:48:23.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_8pLiMqw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/four-key-lessons-from-personal-brand-vetting/\", \"post_id\": \"12181\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 16:48:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 16:48:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"four-key-lessons-from-personal-brand-vetting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12180\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5916\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Four-Key-Lessons-from-Personal-Brand-Vetting.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"545\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467388800,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}

Many women use this metaphor as a way to describe how difficult it is to advance their careers in comparison to men. They can see where they want their careers to go, yet they can&rsquo;t reach their goals, thus creating a metaphorical glass ceiling.  </p><p> In her  Washington Post  article &ldquo;How the &lsquo;glass ceiling&rsquo; became such a powerful &mdash; and problematic &mdash; metaphor,&rdquo; Jena McGregor notes that, while some companies are getting better at including women in leadership roles, there are now even more metaphors than before that capture the difficulty of being a woman in the workforce. </p><p> McGregor notes the different metaphors that exist in the workplace now. &ldquo;Today, we have the &lsquo;glass cliff,&rsquo; used to describe the disproportionate number of times women seem to be put into difficult leadership opportunities. We have the &lsquo;maternal wall,&rsquo; or the career limitations that result from stereotypes of working mothers. There are &lsquo;glass escalators&rsquo; (which describe how men in female-dominated occupations get promoted more rapidly) and even &lsquo;sticky floors&rsquo; (used either to depict either the challenges women face in getting out of low-paying jobs or the limits women impose on themselves).&rdquo; She also mentions that there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;concrete ceiling&rdquo; that represents the obstacles women of color face when trying to advance their careers.</p><p> Inclusive leaders need to pay attention to the metaphors that are describing women&rsquo;s experiences in the workforce. These metaphors show that, even though things have gotten better for professional women, there&rsquo;s still a long way to go. It&rsquo;s up to inclusive leaders to acknowledge the truth and frustration that lies in these metaphors, and it&rsquo;s up to us to help make these metaphors obsolete.</p><p> Although it&rsquo;s difficult to change workplace cultures everywhere, you can start by examining the culture of your own company. Start asking questions. Are qualified women being considered for promotions and leadership roles? Are there barriers that prevent women of color or women of different religions from having access to the same career advancement opportunities? Are new mothers facing discrimination for having a dual focus on their careers and their children? Answering these questions will be helpful in understanding how women feel working for your company.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The best way to learn about the obstacles that women face in their careers is to simply talk to them and listen to their feedback. You will not only gain their trust when it comes to these issues, but also learn where your company can improve when creating more ways for women to break through glass ceilings and fight through other metaphors that reflect their professional struggles.</p><p> These metaphors exist for a reason, and the fact that so many women in the professional world relate to them should be a wake-up call for employers. Pay attention to these metaphors, and learn how they apply to the women in your workplace. Let&rsquo;s remove barriers facing all women &mdash; be inclusive of their concerns and their desire to advance their careers!</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 16:52:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 16:52:47.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_MXmB9BB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/women-in-the-workforce-ask-these-questions-to-understand-how-women-feel-at-work/\", \"post_id\": \"12183\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 16:52:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 16:52:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"women-in-the-workforce-ask-these-questions-to-understand-how-women-feel-at-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12182\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5917\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Women-in-the-Workforce-Ask-These-Questions-to-Understand-How-Women-Feel-at-Work.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2231\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467374400,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5685,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Keys to Being a Top Advisor","link":"10-keys-to-being-a-top-advisor","source_link":null,"content":"<p> After working under one of the most successful advisors in our industry, I took time, studied, read, and reviewed all of the Top Advisors I worked with over the years and found these ten things are the keys to being a top advisor.</p><h3> <strong>  1. They take great care of themselves. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The advisors who have achieved real success do not ever forget about the need to take good care of themselves. Eating healthy and a regular workout routine keep the mind and body sharp. Some would say they are self-centered when it comes to this, but if you as the Top Advisor are not healthy, it impacts all those you employ and your clients who trust you are on the top of your game.</p><h3> <strong>  2. They have a clear vision. </strong></h3><p> <br/> All of the advisors who found long term success know exactly where they want to go in life, all the way to the end. They know what needs to be done to truly live that vision. Writing it out and recording your vision in your own voice is a great way to program your mind to success. Top Advisors use this technique to remind themselves of their vision daily. This keeps them focused and allows them to push through when things get hard.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Yes, they work hard, really hard. </strong></h3><p> <br/> They work a lot, but it is very focused work. Yes they need to have vision and take good care of themselves physically and mentally, but they live for what they do. They work before everyone else is up. Come on, you know the saying the early bird and so on.</p><h3> <strong>  4. They are willing to make mistakes. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Falling down only means you have another chance to get up. Failure means you have a humble way to remind yourself you are human and there is something to learn from the failure. All successful advisors do not dwell on failures or mistakes; they learn and try hard not to make that mistake again.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  5. They control their time. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Their day does not control them; they have to take control of it. Successful advisors will block their time so they can spend the correct amount of time doing each task. They close their door; turn off their phone and email notifications empowers them. They feel in control of their day. One of the best ways they control that time is they have the right processes in place to know when things leave their hands they will be processed correctly and efficiently.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  6. They have a coach now, not a consultant. </strong></h3><p> <br/> They have been through every consulting program out there. They glean what they find important from each of the programs in implement them into their practice and their life. Now, they have a coach because they know they have the tools to be successful; they do not need to be clones of another anymore. They focus on becoming the best they can be; only a great coach can help you with that.</p><h3> <strong>  7. They know learning never stops. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Top advisors are veracious learners, they have multiple designations, licenses, and take time each day practicing and studying their craft. Their day begins with reading. This gets them into the mindset needed to focus all day. Your clients want an advisor who is well read on current issues and ideas.</p><h3> <strong>  8. They have mastered the art of delegation. </strong></h3><p> <br/> They have someone in their corner that takes care of the minutia. This can be a spouse, partner, or an assistant. All successful people do not get their without the support structure to allow them to focus on what they do best. They know what delegation really means. Delegation means you are able to totally hand off that responsibility to someone who can truly do it better than you. Delegation is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of intelligence. Delegation is not losing control; it is a sign of real control.</p><h3> <strong>  9. They have a brand. </strong></h3><p> <br/> They have the best brand they can sell, because it is them to their core. All great advisors have a successful brand that they can spout off at a moment&rsquo;s notice. It is in their DNA. They have a story of why they do what they do and how they do it. It is something they are proud of and ready to say. They believe in their process, because it is structured and works, it is totally in line with their brand.</p><h3> <strong>  10. They give back. </strong></h3><p> <br/> This can take the form of charity, mentoring, great benefits to their employees and team members. Not matter what form it is, a truly great and successful advisor gives back.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 16:55:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 16:55:47.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_kk5iMO7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-keys-to-being-a-top-advisor/\", \"post_id\": \"12185\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 16:55:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 16:55:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-keys-to-being-a-top-advisor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12184\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5918\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10-Keys-to-Being-a-Top-Advisor.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"569\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467360000,"author_id":334,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5687,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Steps to Begin Your Path to Greatness","link":"5-steps-to-begin-your-path-to-greatness","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Do you look at your life and know there is something greater for you? Do you have ideas on what that may be, but can&rsquo;t quite seem to put them in motion or make them happen?</p><p> Feeling stuck is quite common. Many times, we have thoughts and dreams of what we want in life but they never happen because sadly, they only stay as thoughts and dreams inside of us, and our mindset holds us back from going forward.</p><p> The good news is, at any moment in time, we have the ability to start taking action toward creating the life we want.</p><p> Here are five steps to get started:</p><h3> 1. Celebrate Your Success</h3><p> <br/> Before you begin working toward your goals and more greatness in life, be sure to acknowledge all you&rsquo;ve accomplished already. Write down all the successes you&rsquo;ve already achieved and all the awesomeness that you are today. This practice will direct your thinking to a positive place. And once you&rsquo;re in that positive groove with your thoughts, it will lead you to make better choices and take better actions toward your greatness.</p><h3> 2. Create Your True Vision</h3><p> <br/> Many times we live based on others&rsquo; expectations or we stay stuck in a particular place because it&rsquo;s our safety zone. For instance, like in a career we&rsquo;ve been in because we&rsquo;re climbing the ladder and feel like we&rsquo;re too far ahead to make a change - or in a dead-end relationship that isn&rsquo;t going anywhere but you&rsquo;d rather stay in it and be miserable than start over again. Own your path. It can be hard to do, but allow yourself to get out of your head (or stop listening to what others&rsquo; want for you) and focus on your heart and what it&rsquo;s telling you. Look within yourself deeply, and decide what you want and what&rsquo;s true for YOU.</p><h3> 3. Take Action </h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no better time to creating the life you want than right this very moment! Timing is never perfect, and to get started, you just need to put one foot in front of the other. Baby steps are key! Be realistic about your goals. If you want to start going to the gym, going from 0 days a week to 5 days a week right away is extreme, and setting yourself up by biting more than you can chew typically doesn&rsquo;t result in success, but failure. Instead, start slow and go once or twice a week. After you do that for a while and get into a nice groove, up it to more days. Over time, you will build toward your goal by taking realistic, smaller steps to get there.</p><h3> 4. Stay Persistent</h3><p> <br/> Even if you&rsquo;re working hard towards your goal and there seem to be bumps in the road - don&rsquo;t give up. These bumps help you grow and make you stronger each and every time you get past them. So if you&rsquo;re trying to eat better, and you have a day where you aren&rsquo;t sticking to plan, don&rsquo;t throw everything out the window and give up. Be kind to yourself and accept that moment, and then focus back to your vision and keep moving forward. Little by little, those moments of persistence will guide you to creating more greatness in your life.</p><h3> 5. Have the Right Support </h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t do it alone. Enlist in the right support to hold you accountable and cheer you on in the process. It could be a friend, a family member, or significant other who you trust and who have the results you want. Or, a 3rd party like a mentor or coach can give you an outsider perspective. Whoever it may be, having someone you can confide in and have as a sounding board on your journey will be just what you need to keep you on track and celebrate with you as you work toward the life you dream of.</p><h3> Are you ready for more greatness in your life?</h3>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-30 19:02:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-30 19:02:32.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_LEMtVEh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-steps-to-begin-your-path-to-greatness/\", \"post_id\": \"12189\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-30 19:02:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-30 19:02:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-steps-to-begin-your-path-to-greatness\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12188\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5922\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5-Steps-to-Begin-Your-Path-to-Greatness.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1107\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467367200,"author_id":425,"chart_url":""}

The UK accounts for 13% of the EU&rsquo;s population and about 15% of its economic output. To put this into perspective, Brexit would be akin to the entire Northeast region of the United States, including the financial hub of New York, choosing to secede from the union because they pay a lot more in taxes to the center than the benefits they receive in return. &mdash;<a href=\"/contributors/dr-sonu-varghese\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Dr. Sonu Varghese</a><h3> 2.  <a href=\"/network/heres-how-to-position-your-portfolio-for-brexit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Here's How to Position Your Portfolio for Brexit </a></h3><p> The world is dealing with deflationary deleveraging issues. A British exit from the EU may compound those issues marginally, but at the end of the day does not materially change things. Growth has been and will remain modest, and global central bank policy support will remain in place with or without Brexit. &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.oppenheimerfunds.com/advisors/portfolio-manager/krishna-memani\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Krishna Memani </a></p><h3> 3.  <a href=\"/network/brexit-will-fail-for-at-least-ten-reasons\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brexit Will Fail...

Typically, advisors work their hardest in the first year, as they are gathering data, organizing clients&rsquo; financial lives and creating a financial plan. It is not uncommon to spend 30 or more hours devoted to each client&rsquo;s financial future in that first year. &mdash; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIJohnA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> John Anderson</a><h3> 8.  <a href=\"/fintech-center/run-smarter/want-digital-success-invest-in-people\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Want Digital Success?

{"original_id":5689,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A New Take on Independence Day, Post-Brexit","link":"a-new-take-on-independence-day-post-brexit","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Ah, Independence Day! Today, most of us will hang out the flag, fire up the barbecue, and maybe take in a fireworks display. It&rsquo;s the quintessential summer celebration in America. In Britain, not so much. Though July 4 has never given Brits a cause for joy, this summer the country has little to celebrate. The Brexit referendum has turned into a complex game of &ldquo;he said-she said,&rdquo; and at the moment it&rsquo;s unclear how the whole thing will play out. As a result, companies are setting plans to flee the UK, the pound has hit an historic low, and analysts are predicting a near-certain recession in Britain.</p><p> The contrast to what&rsquo;s happening in the US is acute. While the news of the &lsquo;leave&rsquo; vote sent shock waves through Wall Street, the market has recovered at a speed almost as stunning as Brexit itself. After the news hit last Friday, the Dow ended down 602 (-3.5%) in one day. It was difficult not to assume the numbers would continue to fall. Instead, investors have voted that Brexit is simply no big deal&hellip;so far. As I write, the Dow is sitting just over 17,800 after a multi-day rally that has the S&amp;P 500 less than 2% below it&rsquo;s pre-Brexit close last Thursday. The ability of global markets to shrug off what many considered to be an economic disaster is the best evidence yet that investors may have finally learned one of the most important investment rules:  don&rsquo;t sell on bad news . Acting when you&rsquo;re in a state of shock almost always has a regrettable outcome. To avoid costly mistakes, let the dust settle before taking action, and stay the course until any ramifications to your portfolio are clear.</p><p> I spoke with Jackie and Carl yesterday&mdash;long-term clients who have been retired just over 5 years. 42% of their portfolio is in stock, with the remainder in bonds and alternative investments. They&rsquo;re taking a distribution of $2,500 a month ($30,000 a year) out of their $800,000 portfolio. That&rsquo;s 3.8% of the $800K. As retirees, it would have been easy for Jackie and Carl to panic as the effects of the Brexit news played out on Friday. After all, they&rsquo;re on a fixed income, and that $800,000 portfolio declined a little for a couple of days. But if 2008 had any positive value at all, it&rsquo;s that it taught people like Jackie and Carl how to ride out a storm. When we spoke yesterday, they told me they&rsquo;d been ready to batten down the hatches, but they weren&rsquo;t overly concerned; they knew we&rsquo;d structured their portfolio according to their needs, and they trusted its ability to survive the turmoil.</p><p> It was a smart decision. I compared the year-to-date performance of their portfolio last Thursday&mdash;just before the Brexit vote was announced&mdash;to where it sat on Monday evening&mdash;just after Friday&rsquo;s and Monday&rsquo;s declines of 602 and 150 points, respectively, that brought the total market decline to 5%. The good news: Jackie and Carl&rsquo;s account declined just 2% during the same period. The portfolio was designed to survive the bump in the road. By the time the markets closed Wednesday, their overall portfolio was down less than 1% since last Thursday, and even better, it was actually  up  3% YTD&mdash;more than enough to cover their withdrawals for the last six months and still add to their remaining balance. That&rsquo;s something to celebrate on Independence Day!</p><h3> On this July 4 th  weekend, I&rsquo;m reminded of the parallels between America breaking away from England in 1776 and Britain breaking away from the European Union today.</h3><p> <br/> If the Brits had a stock market 240 years ago and the news of America&rsquo;s exit had reached the front page of  <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The London Times </a> , would their stock market have tumbled some 30% or more? Perhaps. But eventually things would have worked their way to a sensible conclusion.</p><p> Britain still has a lot of work to do to iron out Brexit and the resulting political and economic chaos. The European Union has some major repair work to do as well. In the near future, more pain is sure to come. Yet I expect that just as America and Britain both managed to thrive after 1776, the European Union and Britain will do the same&mdash;eventually. And so, I assure you, will the markets. &ldquo;Keep calm and carry on&rdquo;&hellip;and enjoy the fireworks!   </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-03 12:25:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-03 12:25:11.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_DJqnhN5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-new-take-on-independence-day-post-brexit/\", \"post_id\": \"12193\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-03 12:25:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-03 12:25:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-new-take-on-independence-day-post-brexit\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12192\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5925\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A-New-Take-on-Independence-Day-Post-Brexit.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"664\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467619200,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5690,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Future for the Economy and Stock Market? Ask Bob Doll","link":"the-future-for-the-economy-and-stock-market-ask-bob-doll","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> \"What do you think the future holds for the economy and stock market?\" When someone asks me this, my usual answer is, \"I have no clue.\"</h3><p> <br/> My expertise is in personal financial planning and investing, not economics. Few investment advisors are formally trained economists. Most of us know just enough about economics to be dangerous.</p><p> But at a recent conference I had the chance to listen to someone who does have a clue. <a href=\"http://www.nuveen.com/Commentary/BobDoll/WeeklyCommentary.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Bob Doll, senior portfolio manager at Nuveen Asset Management </a> , often discusses investing and the economy on media outlets like Bloomberg TV.</p><p> Doll says that we are in a period called \"more muddle through.\" Basically, he doesn&rsquo;t think the markets are going to go either up or down in a sustained manner. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we should expect calm and quiet stock markets. The 0% return for the first quarter of 2016 included a record-setting double digit drop followed by a double digit recovery.</p><p> Doll reviewed the first 45 days of the year to attempt to explain why in January we had the steepest drop on record in the US market. The reasons he cited were: fear over a recession, fear that oil prices would continue to fall, fear China&rsquo;s slowdown was heading them into a black hole, fear the Federal Reserve would have five interest rate hikes, and fear over the US elections.</p><p> Then he gave the reasons for the market's sharp rally: investors decided there wouldn&rsquo;t be a recession after all, that oil prices probably wouldn&rsquo;t fall to $0 and eventually rise, that even with its slowdown China was still the world&rsquo;s second-fastest growing economy, that the Fed would probably only raise rates once or twice, and that whoever is the next president will be a disaster anyway.</p><p> Doll explained that investors often get \"fear funk,\" a tendency to believe any negative news they hear, without regard to the facts. For example, he noted most politicians are telling us how terrible things are in America. Yet we have added more jobs in the past five years than at any time in history, 89% of them full time. This is one reason he feels the chance of a recession is zero this year. Others are strong job growth, the beginning of wage growth, the fact that individuals are paying off debt and increasing assets, and the economy enjoying the benefit of low oil prices.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Everything isn&rsquo;t all positive, however. Doll warned that the national deficit will rise for several years. However, the national debt is rising slower than GDP so the debt-to-GDP ratio is actually falling, which is a good thing. His biggest worry is that the US has the world's highest marginal tax rate on businesses and the highest taxation on repatriated earnings. He said this more than anything will serve as a real restraint to a vibrant economy.</p><p> When asked where he thought the stock market would end the year, Doll reiterated he really doesn't know.

{"original_id":5691,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Millennials May Be Looking to Change Advisors","link":"why-millennials-may-be-looking-to-change-advisors","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In his song &ldquo;Real Friends&rdquo; musician Kanye West raps, &ldquo;Real friends. It&rsquo;s not many of us. We smile at each other. But how many honest? Trust issues.&rdquo; West wonders whether those around him are there because they really have his best interests at heart, or if they only care about him for his money.Given recent developments in the financial advisory industry, many Millennials might be wondering the same thing about their financial advisor. The Department of Labor (DOL) will soon be enacting a new rule that requires all financial advisors handling a retirement account to abide by a fiduciary standard, which means always acting in the best interests of the client and not the advisor&rsquo;s or corporation&rsquo;s profits. It might be surprising, but that is currently not always the case. If your advisor is not a fiduciary, he or she may not be obligated to act only in your best interest. You can read more about the new rule and our take on the fiduciary obligation  <a href=\"/advisor/7-questions-to-ask-your-financial-advisor-about-the-fiduciary-standard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> .Opponents of the rule, unsurprisingly mostly financial advisors at big banks,  <a href=\"http://m.wealthmanagement.com/industry/report-dol-rule-may-force-advisors-abandon-small-investors?NL=WM-27&amp;Issue=WM-27_20160618_WM-27_55&amp;sfvc4enews=42&amp;cl=article_1_2&amp;utm_rid=CPG09000003982919&amp;utm_campaign=6329&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;elq2=8e29b8ece7c644bfa8ff682effdaff1b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  say that it will decrease access </a>  to financial advice for small investors since advisors &ldquo;cannot figure out how to make money when working with them.&rdquo; Without the fiduciary obligation, how do advisors currently profit from younger investors? Forbes recently published  <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/articles/millennial-sweet-retirement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  an article </a>  by the Morgan Stanley team where advisor T. Gregory Naples says that with Millennial clients he, &ldquo;starts them out in managed mutual funds until they reach $50,000. After that, he often switches them to more transparent and lower-cost stock and bond funds managed by institutional money managers.&rdquo;</p><h3> Breaking it Down</h3>This is a huge admission. Let&rsquo;s break down exactly what Naples is saying. Crucially, Naples admits that, until you hit $50,000 <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp?o=40186&amp;l=dir&amp;qsrc=1&amp;qo=serpSearchTopBox&amp;ap=investopedia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> assets under management</a> (AUM), he invests your money in expensive, inefficient funds that line his own pockets with commissions. Then, once your AUM gets to a point he can make money off of you through fees rather than commissions, he puts your money into more efficient places it should have been all along.Later on, he mentions examples illustrating the power of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> compound interest</a>, but neglects to mention that the unnecessary fees you are incurring from the inefficient funds he has invested your money into will eat away at the returns you get from the compound interest. This illustrates the folly of the argument that the fiduciary rule will drive young investors away. Young investors who are just starting out are, in fact, much better off being driven away from advisors with non-fiduciary practices like Naples. Entrusting your money to a non-fiduciary, traditional financial advisor as a young, new investor is like intentionally hitchhiking on a road known for having murderous truck drivers when there&rsquo;s a much safer road nearby. (Read more about <a href=\"/advisor/6-key-questions-to-ask-a-financial-advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 6 Questions to Ask A Financial Advisor</a>)##TRENDING##People naturally gravitate towards big firms with name recognition. But as the Naples quote demonstrates, these large, non-fiduciary firms may not always be the best option, particularly for young investors. What the back-and-forth over the DOL rule reveals is that non-fiduciary advisors often don&rsquo;t even really want your money. Most seek accounts with higher balances.

As I have written about many times in pieces such as   Groundhog Day, the accuracy, or maybe I should say inaccuracy, of Wall Street estimates consistently reminds me of the saying, &ldquo;Never in doubt but often wrong.&rdquo;  To reinforce this point, John Authers of the Financial Times wrote the following today: &ldquo;Populations across the world have lost faith in the expert guidance of professional economists.&rdquo; (click  <a href=\"https://next.ft.com/content/9c1d386a-3f63-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a>  to read his full piece).Second, you are likely to damage both your mental state and your portfolio if you make investment decisions based on all too common yo-yo like financial headlines such as the following from this past week:</p><li> The Brexit Danger</li><li> Dow, S&amp;P500 on Pace for Best Week in 2016 Post-Brexit</li><li> Reasons Not to Chase Rallies Post Brexit</li>They remind me of the titles of the articles below that appeared only two days apart earlier this year:<li> &ldquo;Wall Street rallies as Yellen&rsquo;s comments suggest that the Fed is  <strong>  unlikely </strong>  to raise rates.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Wall Street falls as the strength of payroll data suggest that the Fed is  <strong>  likely </strong>  to raise rates&rdquo;</li>The moral of both those stories should have been:Remember, &ldquo;projections are based on estimates&rdquo; (yes, estimates based on estimates) and &ldquo;assessments have a considerable amount of uncertainty&rdquo; (both are recent direct quotes from Janet Yellen, Chair of the Federal Reserve &ndash; for more see <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/13515793/1/should-you-treat-wall-street-forecasts-like-april-fool-s-day-jokes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Should You Treat Wall Street Forecasts Like April Fool&rsquo;s Day Jokes?</a>).<h3> So, what should you be focused on that is within your control?</h3>Your long-term plan, not the models or projections of others.I know it&rsquo;s hard to not get caught up in the emotion of the market, but try to remember the old saying, &ldquo;Investors create 50-year floods every few years&rdquo; (yes, it&rsquo;s OK to smile when you think about the words &ldquo;investors create&rdquo;).As was the case this week, when Brexit-like floods happen, my firm gets calls asking for our opinion about where the market will go next.We don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball, but we are always willing to make this prediction.Whenever you see large market swings you will see:<li> Sensational headlines that are designed to catch eyeballs and sell ads, but that are often not conducive to good investing</li><li> Wall Street, which loves volatility, not missing out on the opportunity to sell a trade or product when emotions are high</li><li> Investors being sold short-term ideas that harm long-term returns</li>If and when these predictions come to pass, you might be wise to remember the tag line of the drug-related public service announcement from the 1980s, &ldquo;Just Say No&rdquo;.##TRENDING##To help, below is a graph that illustrates what all investors feel from time to time (professionals included).<img alt=\"\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/market-emotions.png\" width=\"495\"/>To highlight this cycle, this week more than one person called us to ask if they should sell (last weekend and Monday and Tuesday).  These calls were followed by calls and emails from some of the same people at the end of this week asking when they should buy.  Yes, as many studies show and the graph above illustrates, investors have the tendency to sell low and buy high.We aren&rsquo;t sure what the next few weeks or months will bring, but along the lines of the picture above, at some point more &ldquo;alarmed&rdquo; comments will be published again.When this happens, try to remember that even though it can seem boring, if you resist emotion and stick to your long-term plan, the slow and steady tortoise often comes out on top.If you kept calm this week, you would have been &ldquo;relieved&rdquo; to find that the value of your portfolio had likely gone up. In addition, you would have avoided &ldquo;frightened&rdquo; selling for a loss (see the below graph of the last five days of price movements of the DJIA &ndash; the red circle represents the panic selling early this week).<img alt=\"\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/price-movements.png\" width=\"913\"/>Source: Wall Street JournalIn-line with this week&rsquo;s focus on the U.K., as long as you have a well-diversified, long-term plan that is designed to meet your goals, keep in mind the following age-old investing quote from a well known British writer:&ldquo;My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate &hellip; Therefore, my merchandise makes me not sad.&rdquo; - William Shakespeare, Merchant of VeniceFor<a href=\"/advisor/keep-a-steady-hand-on-the-tiller\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> more on our thoughts</a>, including a more contemporary quote from my 11-year old son following a 500+ plus point market drop last year, click on the following.

And yet, this is the internal operating system that guides beliefs, behaviors and habits for many of us.</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I feel so stupid&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t (financially) keep up with my friends and family!&rdquo; </p><p> Blame and shame&mdash;like a tape playing in your head&mdash;will keep you from installing new beliefs that will lead to a happier and more fulfilling financial life. That&rsquo;s why I devoted a whole chapter to the subject in my new book &ldquo;The Feel Rich Project&rdquo;.</p><p> Living in a blame and shame mentality is like driving in the express lane on a highway to hell. It&rsquo;s impossible to focus on living the life you crave when every action (my investment tanked) creates a knee-jerk reaction of negativity (I&rsquo;m just too stupid to understand this). You spiral down instead of picking yourself up and making a new, better decision.</p><h3> You need a little attitude adjustment to get yourself out of that spiral.</h3><p> <br/> Start by considering where your thinking comes from. Did you hear it from your parents when you were growing up? Perhaps you&rsquo;re mimicking their behavior. Or maybe you blame someone else (or your situation) because you feel powerless to make changes.</p><p> Next, spend some time considering your values and why they are so important to you. Values are statements of what matters most to you, such as: I want to ensure I don&rsquo;t outlive my resources. Or, I want to live debt-free so I can sleep at night knowing I&rsquo;m on the right track.</p><p> Your values are uniquely yours and deserve to be held as the focal point of your habits and behavior. State your values clearly and concisely. What MUST happen for you to feel satisfied? What are you grateful for and what can you celebrate daily? If you&rsquo;re stuck for an answer, think&hellip;your children, your partner, your health, your parents, your friends, etc.</p><p> OK, so now you know where your blame and shame come from AND you know what you value most. So you can rework your blame and shame statements with something positive and affirming:</p><p> Instead of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault&rdquo;, try:  <strong>  &ldquo;This is not working as well as I had hoped, so how can we work together to make better decisions?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Instead of &ldquo;I feel so stupid&rdquo;, try,  <strong>  &ldquo;I will begin gathering better information and work with experts to become better informed.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Instead of &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me&rdquo;, try:  <strong>  &ldquo;It appears that our communication needs some work. What can we do to make it more effective?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Instead of &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t (financially) keep up with my friends and family&rdquo;, try:  <strong>  &ldquo;I know what I value most and the life that others live is irrelevant to me. I direct my resources to my highest values. Those who love me will not judge my decisions.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Engaging in blame and shame about your money is clearly both destructive and meaningless. You can shift from negative, hurtful beliefs with your decision to approach your financial life from a more positive direction. Chances are, changing your mindset won&rsquo;t happen overnight and you&rsquo;ll have a few bumps and bruises.

{"original_id":5694,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Ways to Conquer Your Financial Anxiety","link":"8-ways-to-conquer-your-financial-anxiety","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> If you&rsquo;re someone who feels a little anxious when it comes to your personal finances, you&rsquo;re not alone.</h3><p> <br/> You may be surprised to learn that, in fact, fifty percent of Americans have less than one month&rsquo;s income saved for a rainy day and  <a href=\"http://www.economywatch.com/personal-finance/a-dozen-shocking-personal-finance-statistics.23-04.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  fifty-six percent of people have no idea their credit score is the most important factor for applying for a mortgage, car loan and new credit card </a> . One in four people have almost nothing saved for retirement, with about twenty-six percent of workers reporting their household has less than $1,000 saved according to  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/22/retirement/retirement-savings/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">  a new report from Employee Benefit Research Institute </a> .</p><p> Knowing that many Americans are faced with money concerns that can leave anyone feeling uncertain or uncomfortable about the financial future, here&rsquo;s eight steps to overcoming your financial anxieties:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Admit There&rsquo;s a Problem </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the best ways to tackle your anxiety is to first acknowledge that you actually have it and work to determine why. If you&rsquo;re living paycheck to paycheck, don&rsquo;t have an emergency fund, or you&rsquo;re not able to put any money aside for retirement &ndash; those could be the underlying causes of your stress and anxiety. There is no shame in admitting there is an issue, and sticking your head in the sand won&rsquo;t alleviate the pain. Things happen and life moves quickly. The point is not to dwell on past missteps, but instead to pinpoint the issue and focus on what to do from here.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Think About Your Money Scripts </strong></h3><p> <br/> What is your core belief about money? How does money make you feel and what role does it play in your life? Maybe you&rsquo;re someone who has always avoided money. Maybe you never think there is enough money and are constantly in the pursuit of more.</p><p> There are four primary &ldquo;money scripts&rdquo; that have been identified by financial psychologist Bradly Klontz. He categorizes them in the following way:</p><li> Money Avoidance: Thinking money is inherently bad and a source of anxiety.</li><li> Money Worship: Thinking happiness is contingent on having enough money (and there can never be too much money).</li><li> Money Status: When you believe your self-worth is interchangeable with net-worth.</li><li> Money Vigilance: When you see yourself as a steward of your money that must be carefully handled and intentionally directed. <br/>  </li><p> Which money script(s) do you most identify with? Getting honest with yourself and how you relate to money can help you overcome any anxieties you may have around your finances.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Talk to Someone </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again. Most people would rather share the number of people they&rsquo;ve been intimate with then tell you the balance of their bank account.</p><p> Talking about money is important. When you talk about money, whether it&rsquo;s a question, concern or an overall feeling &ndash; you learn things you didn&rsquo;t know before. I recommend having safe money talks with people you trust.  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/5-signs-you-may-need-a-financial-planner/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  A financial planner </a> , therapist, a trusted friend or family member are all wonderful options when it comes to having money conversations. If you don&rsquo;t talk to someone, you may never really face what it is that has you troubled about finances.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t Keep Money Secrets </strong></h3><p> <br/> Do you hide receipts from your spouse or keep a credit card or bank about he doesn&rsquo;t know about? Money secrets can range from little white lies about small purchases to large secrets regarding unmentioned credit card debt.</p><p> In 2011, the National Endowment for Financial Education discovered that  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2011/01/13/is-your-partner-cheating-on-you-financially-31-admit-money-deception-infidelity-red-flags-money-lies/#2e4312d637bf\" target=\"_blank\">  31% of Americans admitted lying to their partners about their finances </a> . 67% of respondents said the secrets &ndash; when revealed &ndash; led to arguments, 42% said it damaged trust, and 16% said it even led to divorce. Results of a new survey in 2015 revealed the percentage of those who admitted they had financially deceived their partners rose to 33%.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s agree right now that it&rsquo;s a good idea to be open and honest with your spouse about money. Financial infidelity is a real thing and it can drive a major wedge in your very important relationship, only heightening your anxiety around finances. Instead, be transparent about your finances and share in the responsibility of overcoming any hurdles to reach shared goals for the life you&rsquo;re building together.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  5. Create Goals </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the best ways to conquer your financial anxiety is to create goals that put you in the driver&rsquo;s seat of your financial life. If you always feel like you&rsquo;re reacting (instead of being proactive) with your money situation, you&rsquo;re letting your finances control you and that can be a major source of anxiety.</p><p> Creating and achieving your money goals can alleviate so much of the stress you feel about finances, because it means that you know where you are today and where you want to be tomorrow. Having specific money goals then creates the framework by which you can take the right steps to reach them.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Set a Plan and Increase Your Knowledge </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know and feeling like you may be operating in the dark on certain matters can cause angst. One way to combat that feeling of uncertainty or worry is by intentionally growing your knowledge in the money areas that affect you the most.</p><p> Increasing your financial knowledge doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to become a finance expert. It just means that you learn more about the financial matters that help you make informed choices when it comes to your money.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Stop Comparing </strong></h3><p> <br/> Comparison really is the thief of all joy; the breeder of discontentment. When you look to the lives of others, rarely do you see the entire financial picture. What you see is what people want you to see and looks can be deceiving.</p><p> Instead, try as best as you can to stay focused on your money journey, where you&rsquo;re headed and how you&rsquo;re going to get there. It truly doesn&rsquo;t matter what anyone else is earning, buying or doing and at what stage in their life they&rsquo;re doing so. All that really matters is that you&rsquo;re  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Work-Your-Wealth-Smarter-Choices-ebook/dp/B01BN0TP0Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461965831&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=work+your+wealth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  making the smartest choices you can with your money </a>  so that it supports the life you want to live and the future you want to have.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Do the Work </strong></h3><p> <br/> Taking control of your finances is the secret to overcome any of your money anxiety. It can be fun, but you also need to be prepared to do the work &ndash; because it takes effort. You&rsquo;ll need to be willing to devote a few hours or an afternoon to dig into your money situation. Take the time to find out what kind of life you want and how to put your money where your heart is. Take steps to overcome debt and establish good spending and saving habits. Make the decision to invest in your future and protect what&rsquo;s most important to you.</p><p> At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s your financial life and you can take control  any time . You have what it takes to overcome any money issues or hang ups that are causing you anxiety. Start here. Start today. There is no reason to wait another minute to start feeling more comfortable when it comes to your personal finances.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-03 13:49:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-03 13:49:18.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_e1kFvoq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-ways-to-conquer-your-financial-anxiety/\", \"post_id\": \"12205\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-03 13:49:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-03 13:49:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-ways-to-conquer-your-financial-anxiety\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12204\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5930\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/8-Ways-to-Conquer-Your-Financial-Anxiety.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"779\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467626400,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5695,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Retirement Planning: Top 10 Learned Lessons","link":"retirement-planning-top-10-learned-lessons","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Dave and Colleen both retired early simultaneously from very high-stress careers and moved to the Gulf Islands. Through years of hard work, they have a good government pension and decent RRSP savings.</p><h3> Top Ten Lessons Dave and Colleen Have Learned from Retirement</h3><h3> <br/> 1. You can retire at the same time.</h3><p> <br/> Many people recommend not retiring at the same time. Dave and Colleen found that being able to support each other and work on their new life together was very valuable.</p><h3> 2. Stress does not go away</h3><p> <br/> Work stress of course goes away, but stress from other areas of life seems to fill in a fair bit of what was removed. The significant thing is that these items are actually important: health, family, and the like. These stressors are not meaningless work-related items but the important parts of life.</p><h3> 3. You should have your hobbies and projects setup and ready</h3><p> <br/> Retirement planning isn&rsquo;t only about the finances. You should have developed, or be developing, your interests outside of work, so you can start on these as soon as you retire. You do not need to have spent a lot of time on these (who has the time when working), but have identified what you want to spend your time doing. Dave took a woodworking course at night and now spends part of each day working on furniture projects. Colleen enjoyed jewelry design, now sells at the local farmer&rsquo;s market.</p><h3> 4. Physical space from each other is important</h3><p> <br/> You used to spend 8-10 hours away from each other 5 days a week, now you are together all the time. Develop a plan for some physical space away from each other. Heading to the gym at different times or a workshop is a great idea. Arrange so you have some time apart most days.</p><h3> 5. People at your old job really do not care you are gone.</h3><p> <br/> The day you leave, life goes on at your old job, and it really is as if you were never there. Do not visit too much, they are busy, have made changes, and may not really want to hear how wonderful retirement is.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 6. Take time to participate in volunteer work.</h3><p> <br/> If you are already involved in some volunteer work, you can of course spend more time at that. For any new volunteer work, take some time and carefully review what you want to do. There are hundreds of opportunities out there, try a few to pick what you want to do.</p><h3> 7. Have a small nest egg for the first year outside of your budget.</h3><p> <br/> If at all possible, try and have a few thousand saved away so you can start on your projects, go on a trip, or buy some things you have wanted. If this does not effect your first years budgeting, it will be easier.</p><h3> 8. A truly fixed income after years of increasing income takes getting use to</h3><p> <br/> Most professional&rsquo;s salaries increase over the years, so the idea that your income is now truly fixed can be daunting. Work with your financial advisor on a needs and wants budget. Make sure you can cover the needs and adjust the wants as time and conditions change, but do not be afraid to spend the &ldquo;wants&rdquo; if conditions are right. You are retired and you should enjoy it!</p><h3> 9. Take realistic life expectancy into account when planning.</h3><p> <br/> One of them has usually long-lived relatives on all branches of their family tree. The other has some fairly short branches on their tree. While a bus can hit anyone tomorrow, they have planned their cash flow, pension choices and life insurance with these life expectancy issues in mind.</p><h3> 10. Retire as soon as you possibly can.</h3><p> <br/> Retirement is wonderful! The chance to do what you want, when you want is invaluable to your own physical and mental health, as well as the health of your relationship.</p><p> Dave and Colleen retired the first day they could draw a pension, and would recommend that people work with their financial advisor to put together a realistic retirement plan, and making do with less is absolutely worth it to be retired.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-04 11:36:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-04 11:36:14.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_Bzetasu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/retirement-planning-top-10-learned-lessons/\", \"post_id\": \"12209\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-04 11:36:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-04 11:36:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"retirement-planning-top-10-learned-lessons\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12208\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5932\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Retirement-Planning-Top-10-Learned-Lessons.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"509\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467741600,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}

When did the brand identity get lost amidst work flow and production?</p><p> When you look back at the last 3-5 years of company growth, you might automatically default to looking at the P&amp;L sheets and measure growth by profit and how many followers, likes and shares it has. As a Balance &amp; Relationship Advisor, I look at company growth a bit differently, it&rsquo;s measured by the brands cultural identity.</p><p> <strong>  Do people want to work there? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Are they encouraged to share innovative ideas? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Are you willing to break outdated norms to build trust, increase reciprocity and retain them? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Do you value your people or only how well they help your company posture for a position of best in industry? </strong></p><p> Your commitment to listen to the needs of the people who move the needle of quality service and delivery is integral to increasing dollars just as much as it is to increasing happiness for your needle movers, your people.</p><p> At some point, perhaps between the boom in supply and demand and the company team growing from &ldquo;we are a family&rdquo; mantras to &ldquo;who&rsquo;s the new guy in the office down the hall,&rdquo; there was a paradigm shift in the culture. It wasn&rsquo;t a good one either. Your business brand may look great on paper or on your digital footprint, but how does it look behind the published curtain? Do people stay because they need to be there or because they want to be there?</p><p> Have you created a culture where those who have been deemed high-achievers and leaders are afraid to set boundaries by not answering emails or calls after-hours? If you have, I guarantee the trickle down from those leaders feels more than a bit yucky to the front-line members below.</p><p> Is your company a place where putting in for vacation feels like an act of interrogation as they sit and wait for permission to use time earned? Countries all over the world, including <a href=\"http://koreabizwire.com/korean-government-pushes-work-life-balance/59824\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Korea </a>  are moving into a space of awareness that boundaries and balance matters. It&rsquo;s not clich&eacute; and <strong>  work-life balance is definitely NOT DEAD </strong> as some would have you believe.</p><p> Whether you have a leadership position or not, think about yourself for a moment, as an individual who does great work and puts in tons of hours for your organization. When you think about your number one struggle, do you want to spend time deciding if its better to play a game of semantics to define the challenge of managing all the things on your plate as a work-life-balance challenge vs work-life integration or work-life conflict? Who cares!  </p><p> What you do know, is there&rsquo;s a disconnect in how things are and how things should be. You chose this field, this industry, this organization because you envisioned working somewhere that allowed you to use the best parts of yourself and feel good doing it. You didn&rsquo;t imagine working at a company that has a great brand image on the outside, yet the identity inside was out of alignment. You want to come to work, every day for a company that appreciates you while they have you, not when you leave.</p><p> So how do you balance the brand identity behind the business?</p><h3> 1. <strong>  Get Real. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you are in a position to influence change, then be honest about what change needs to happen. Are you dealing with low morale? Are there communication issues? Do people simply not trust each other? Are there boundary issues between leadership and middle-managers and front-line employees?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 2. <strong>  Speak Up. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you are not in a position to influence change, if you feel like you aren&rsquo;t being heard or that no one will listen to you because you don&rsquo;t hold a certain title, you&rsquo;re not stuck.</p><p> You have a voice and deserve to be heard.</p><p> Request a Pre-Exit Meeting with whoever is in charge of People Development and Retention. Those titles are dramatically different from company to company and could fall under the CHRO, Sr. Talent and Retention Officer, CLO, CMO, CEO or even Chief Happiness Officer (yes, that&rsquo;s a real thing ). Tell them that you don&rsquo;t want to leave, how you love your work and be honest about why you are unhappy.</p><h3> 3. <strong>  Partner Up and Succeed </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t settle for what the company does on paper.

If there is any reaction, both are transformed.&rdquo; Carl Jung</h3>There is a lot to do when you form a new business, which is one reason that many people choose to team up with a business partner.  While being in a partnership can solve a lot of problems, it too often creates other, more vexing ones.  The inability of partners to work well together over the long-term is the chief cause of failure in business partnerships.   And, unfortunately, they fail a lot. The failure rate among business partnerships is 70 -80% after 5 years.Despite these grim statistics, proactive tools to help form great partnerships have been slow to surface. Now, though, because of advances in social science, entrepreneurship, and behavioral testing, we have a lot more information available to develop a model to score potential partners on how well they are likely to work together, or how susceptible they might be to the kind of conflict that derails so many businesses.The goal is to help partners zero in on their &ldquo;optimal distinctiveness&rsquo;, the social science idea that groups really thrive when there is both strong connectedness, because of similar values and behaviors, and also enough differences that each partner is bringing something valuable to the venture. Using 20 different data points, we have developed a scoring method for partnership compatibility that is weighted for:<li> Communication styles</li><li> Complementary behaviors</li><li> Aligned values and motivators</li>The idea of aligned values is especially important for long-term success. Many of those whose behaviorsinitiallyseem at odds can be great partners if they have compatible communication styles and share underlying values.  For example, while you might think that two partners with dominant personalities would clash, they can be very effective as partners.  With their dynamic approaches to problem solving, if they share underlying values, they will be able to move forward with confidence.The right combination also leads to trust, which is key to successful business partnerships. By shedding light on the deeper dimensions of partner compatibility, partners are able to focus on their new business and avoid the highs of early excitement to be followed by post-honeymoon disappointment.To learn more about our Partnership Compatibility Score,<a href=\"http://thepartnershipresource.com/Research.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> click here</a>to take a look at our research and reports.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-04 11:57:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-04 11:57:15.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/predicting-business-partnership-success.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/predicting-business-partnership-success/\", \"post_id\": \"12213\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-04 11:57:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-04 11:57:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"predicting-business-partnership-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"57841\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5934\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Predicting-Business-Partnership-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1189\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467709200,"author_id":478,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;m sure that your least secure clients either contacted you immediately or they are at home obsessing about the impact on their portfolios.</p><p> Did you recently make some investment recommendations to clients and those investments got hammered by the BREXIT situation?</p><p> Do such events cause you to lose sleep, worry about disgruntled clients calling you, or even question your core investment strategies for your clients?</p><p> These are common sources of advisor stress, but it is crucial to realize that your stress is NOT caused by BREXIT, or volatile stock markets.  Those are neutral events&hellip;yes, I said NEUTRAL EVENTS.</p><p> What actually always causes our stress is our <strong>  interpretation of the events </strong> in some catastrophic way.</p><p> In short, it&rsquo;s what we say to ourselves about the events that causes stress&hellip;our inner self-talk.</p><h3> The Culpret is Catastrophic Self-Talk</h3><p> <br/> The burgeoning field of &ldquo;Cognitive Therapy&rdquo; has provided us with many techniques to grab potentially stressful situations and &ldquo;de-catastrophize&rdquo; them, resulting in significant avoidance of or calming of the stress.</p><p> Essentially, stress-prone folks have developed a habit of looking at a situation and assuming the worst possible consequences of that situation are 100% likely to happen.</p><p> So, with the initial BREXIT crash of 600 points, many advisors and their clients assumed the market would continue to tailspin and portfolio values would plummet.</p><h3> <strong>  Step #1:  Stop the Catastrophizing Self-Talk, Now! </strong></h3><p> <br/> Put a #64 rubber band on your wrist (the fat ones that come with your mail).</p><p> The first clue that you are using catastrophic self-talk is using the phrase &ldquo;what if.&rdquo;  The problem with &ldquo;what if&rsquo;s&rdquo; is that you tend to believe that there is a 100% probability that what you fear happening will actually happen.  Let&rsquo;s say your thought is <strong>  &ldquo;What if this aggressive client fires me because of my recommendations for him and what just happened with the market? </strong></p><p> Once you catch yourself using such anxiety provoking phrases, immediately stop by snapping the rubber band on your wrist and telling yourself to &ldquo;stop this silly thinking.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  Step #2:  Take Some Deep, Relaxing Breaths </strong></h3><p> <br/> Breath in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold it for 4 seconds and breath out through your mouth for 8 seconds.  This forces you to breath through your diaphragm, which is the most calming breathing.</p><h3> <strong>  Step #3:  Challenge the &ldquo;What if&rdquo; Thought </strong></h3><p> <br/> Now that you have calmed yourself with your breathing, it&rsquo;s time to challenge the thought. Most catastrophizing thoughts are irrational because what you fear has a very low probability of occurring, so answer the following questions for yourself:</p><li> &ldquo; What is the actual probability that this client will fire me over this?</li><li> &ldquo;Is there anything I can tell this client to calm his fears and anger?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;My core values have been developed over many years of examining stock market history, being mentored by experts, etc., so why would I change those values now?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;What is the worst thing that could happen if I lose this client?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Even if this worst case scenario did occur, what would I do?&rdquo;   (example responses: &ldquo;I would focus on my other clients and get new ones,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I would rationalize that this pain in the neck client is now off my back,&rdquo; etc.) <br/>  </li><p> By focusing on the actual probability that what you fear will happen, you will dispel much of your fear.  By coming up with a plan for dealing with the situation if it really did happen, you will begin to see that your fear is not as earth-shattering as you imagined.</p><p> These are three simple but very important steps.  In fact, my advisor clients tell me that consistently practicing these steps has had a major impact on their stress!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-04 12:04:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-04 12:04:12.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_ONCPyRB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-simple-steps-to-de-catastrophizing-scary-events-such-as-brexit/\", \"post_id\": \"12215\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-04 12:04:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-04 12:04:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-simple-steps-to-de-catastrophizing-scary-events-such-as-brexit\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12214\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5935\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/3-Simple-Steps-to-De-Catastrophizing-Scary-Events-Such-as-BREXIT.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1183\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467738900,"author_id":153,"chart_url":""}

But luck really boils down to one thing: Events we don&rsquo;t create that influence our lives &mdash;and critically, how we respond to them (e.g., the financial markets we inhabit).</p><p> &ldquo;It is not the brightest who succeed,&rdquo; Gladwell writes. &ldquo;Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities&mdash;and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.&rdquo;</p><p> Luck can come down to something as simple as when you were born.

And of course to be better prepared for allocation and investment decisions.</p><p> Yes, interest rates obviously impact investment trajectories. The Fed Funds target rate also impacts bond prices, margin rates, savings rates, house loans, and auto loans.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5a3fd2_df0a0c7cf3b246d7afadcf0daec7e79a~mv2_d_2617_16000_s_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_630,h_3852,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/5a3fd2_df0a0c7cf3b246d7afadcf0daec7e79a~mv2_d_2617_16000_s_2.jpg\"/></p><h3> <strong>  When Will Interest Rates Go Up? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Who knows? Maybe Janet Yellen knows, but should we care?</p><p> One thing we may say with some comfort &ndash; interest rates can&rsquo;t go much lower. (Or can they?)</p><p> As of June 30, 2016, the fed fund target rate was between 0.025% and 0.50%.</p><p> The Fed moved the target rate to zero more than seven years ago, on December 16, 2008, where it remained unchanged until December 2, 2015. Prior to last December, the last rate increase was in 2001, when the Fed raised the target rate to 5.25%. Since then, it&rsquo;s been mostly a slow decline, or at zero.</p><p> &ldquo;The fed target rate is the interest rate charged by one depository institution on an overnight sale of balances at the Federal Reserve to another depository institution, as determined by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve.&rdquo; (Source: Investopedia.)</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  What the Hike? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Since 1983, we have witnessed six cycles of rate hikes. Three were in the 1980s, two in the 1990s, and one in the oughts.</p><p> The average rate increase per cycle was 2.81%.</p><p> The average length of an interest rate up cycle was 14 months.</p><p> Does this mean that the next set of increases, whenever they occur, will be similar in scope and length? Of course not, but you have to start somewhere, and history may be a pretty good guide, so why not start with history?</p><h3> <strong>  The Impact on Asset Classes </strong></h3><p> <br/> So how do different asset classes react to rate hikes?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s use one time period, namely, one year after the hike cycle. (See infographic for more). After 12 months of increased interest rates, stocks, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index, lost 10.00% of their value, and bonds lost 5.00%, as proxied by the U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.</p><p> Is there an alternative? Yes, and it&rsquo;s alternative investments &ndash; hedge funds, managed futures, and CTAs, for example. One year after the same interest rate hike cycles, on average, managed futures did 17% better than stocks, and hedge funds did 2% better. (Managed futures results were represented by the Barclay CTA Index, and hedge funds by the Dow Jones Credit Suisse hedge Fund Index.) Past performance you fill in the blanks, I mean, cannot guarantee future similar results.</p><h3> <strong>  The Height of Folly? </strong></h3><p> <br/> As RCM notes, the Fed has had nine chairmen since its&rsquo; founding in 1913.

Perhaps they may be interested in getting a second opinion.&rdquo; </strong> Pretty simple approach and he says it is having results. I think it takes confidence to ask a question like that in turbulent times. But if you know what you are doing is helping clients &ndash; why wouldn&rsquo;t you ask?</p><p> On the other hand, for those that really don&rsquo;t like to directly ask, here are  <strong>  3 different strategies producing referrals that don&rsquo;t require you to ask: </strong></p><h3> 1. When a client asks, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; instead of giving a stock answer you could answer by sharing that&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Our business is strong right now even though the market is volatile thanks to many of our clients who have been so kindly spreading the word about our firm to others that truly need our expertise. It is easy to be a good financial advisor in perfect conditions but it is the more uncertain times where we seem to get new introductions from clients. To us this is a powerful indication that we are doing things right for our clients. I am grateful. Thank you for asking.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Answer the silent question, &ldquo;Who Cares?&rdquo; when you are describing your firm.</h3><p> <br/> Instead of giving the features of what you do make sure you are talking in benefits. Benefits affect people. Your proposed and perceived benefits will be what is remembered and passed along to others. What are the biggest benefits you deliver in difficult times?</p><h3> 3. At the end of a meeting with a client &ndash; make a bold and confident statement&hellip;.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;We know that the kind of work we do at XYZ Firm is unique. We communicate and serve our clients deeply in good times and volatile times. This is actually different than what many in this industry do.  We know that there are many other people that NEED our services that we can and should be helping right now while the stock market is so volatile. Our challenge is reaching them. What do you think we can do to continue get the word circulating so it reaches the people in need of a better financial advisor? &ldquo;</p><p> The key is focus.

{"original_id":5702,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Planning Through Life's Disruptions: Advising Late in Life Divorce","link":"planning-through-lifes-disruptions-advising-late-in-life-divorce","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Every 10 seconds a Baby Boomer turns 60 years old.  As a Baby Boomer approaching retirement, let us assume that you and your spouse have been fiscally responsible for most of your lives. Together with your financial advisor, you have plotted forward an investment strategy that eases you into a comfortable standard of living during your retirement years. You have diligently addressed major gaps in retirement savings and focused on meeting needs, both anticipated and unpredictable, along the way.</p><p> You probably maximized all retirement benefits with employers and individual savings.  Chances are that your investment portfolio is mature and positioned for longevity, to replace income for lost earnings, and is diversified.  The financial planning process has provided you with confidence that in retirement, you will have enough money and not outlive it.</p><p> But what happens when one household now unexpectedly divides itself in two with a late in life divorce? 1 in 4 couples getting a divorce is older than 50.  Gray divorce is prevalent and statistics clearly indicate that more divorced adults are becoming divorced seniors than in any other prior generation.</p><h3> More to untangle</h3><p> <br/> Divorcing later in life is different in many ways: you have more to untangle and you suddenly face life alone when you are older.  You have to deal with several challenges: dividing one household into two; re-evaluating near term retirement goals; revising estate planning goals; contending with longer life expectancies; addressing gaps in health insurance coverage; and, re-examining investment decisions.  It is truly a &ldquo;perfect storm&rdquo; where not only are your financial goals turned upside down, but planning is further complicated often by emotional and psychological turmoil afflicting your rational decision-making.</p><p> Wealth clearly makes a difference to retirement preparedness and to planning opportunities. However, what matters most at the outset of divorce is to budget for the cost of divorce, cover your fixed expenses (&ldquo;the basics&rdquo;), and prioritize cash and liquidity.  Look at three factors:  the sources of your retirement income, the flexibility of your budget, and your ability to tolerate risk both on a practical and psychological basis.</p><p> Divorcing later in life is different in many ways: you have more to untangle and you suddenly face life alone when you are older</p><p> From there, you can restructure a mature portfolio to project cash flows</p><p> (1) based on investment scenarios to replace earned income or lack of spousal support;</p><p> (2) based on developing solutions for creating cash flow.</p><p> These solutions may include working in retirement, reverse mortgages, decreasing expenses, annuitizing assets,  and exploring claiming strategies to maximize your and your ex-spouse&rsquo;s social security benefits,  etc .</p><p> A shift may have to happen in the way you invest and you may have to rebalance your portfolio in order to:</p><li> Seek greater income or yield</li><li> Weigh options for giving up control over investments for the guaranty of income in retirement from an annuity</li><li> Evaluate risk reward for aggressively investing in equities for growth if pensions and social security meet needs</li><li> Recalibrate more frequently</li><li> Shed high risk or private complicated and illiquid investments <br/>  </li><h3> Investment Schedule</h3><p> <br/> Be aware that your natural inclination will be to stop investing after you or your ex-spouse retires or to switch to overly conservative investing.  If your needs are being met with current income or cash flow, it is probable that you should want your money to keep growing after you retire.  What this means is that you should:</p><li> Design asset allocation to optimize for taxes</li><li> Diversify to lower volatility</li><li> Research low cost investment target date mutual funds for short term ladder approach to meet near term needs for supplemental cash <br/>  </li><p> Finally at this stage of life, if you divorce, focus on your priority for financial security, and then later, on stages of retirement.  There&rsquo;s no perfect formula.  Tough choices need to be made.  For example, your divorce agreement may not provide sufficient spousal support for you to make gifts, allowances, or cover expenses for your adult children, relatives or charitable &ldquo;causes&rdquo;.</p><p> It is important to be prepared to avoid financial disaster and mismanagement of your net worth.  I suggest you routinely measure portfolio performance against needs and goals, especially in times of low investment yield, volatile markets, and limited capacity to replenish investment losses with income.  Gray Divorce is the beginning of a new era for mature portfolio management.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-04 12:46:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-04 12:46:29.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_mmZQNmF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/planning-through-lifes-disruptions-advising-late-in-life-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"12223\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-04 12:46:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-04 12:46:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"planning-through-lifes-disruptions-advising-late-in-life-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12222\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5939\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Planning-Through-Life\\u2019s-Disruptions-Advising-Late-in-Life-Divorce.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"765\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467727200,"author_id":307,"chart_url":""}

The European Championships in full bloom.</p><p> My 91-year-old mom and me, howling at the tv screen in her living room, cheering the German team. The joys of soccer run deep in my family. Decades of tv watching with mom and dad and my brother Thomas. Yup, sweet.</p><p> The win that most captivated my heart, however, isn&rsquo;t a German one. It is Iceland advancing to the Round of 8, beating England 2:1.</p><p> It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen. In the history of international soccer championships, Iceland had not won a single game in the Eliminating Rounds, let alone advanced to the Play-offs. Iceland doesn&rsquo;t have a professional soccer league, is ranked #34 by FIFA among the soccer nations of the world. England is ranked #11 and boasts some of the most heralded soccer stars in the world.</p><p> Iceland&rsquo;s win is THE most significant sports victory in the country&rsquo;s history. 99.8% of all television sets in Iceland were tuned to the game. British tabloids dubbed it the most shameful defeat in the fabled history of English soccer. England&rsquo;s coach Roy Hodgson instantly resigned in shame.</p><p> The heart loves an underdog win.</p><p> Iceland&rsquo;s startling run makes me think of how you and I win, every day, in our less chronicled lives. What does winning look like for us? What insights can we gleam from an underdog tale?</p><h3> <strong>  1. Believe you can win. </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s part of our Viking history , says Icelandic Journalist Alexander Einarrson in a ViceSports documentary.  We&rsquo;re just a little bit crazy. We think we can do everything and go for it. <br/> <br/> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We&rsquo;ve all been taught to believe. We have all told ourselves that we can win whatever it is we think we want to win at a particular moment in time. And then the gnawing thoughts pop in.  No, not really. If I get lucky. Highly unlikely. Won&rsquo;t happen. <br/> <br/> We kinda sorta believe. That&rsquo;s not belief. It is wishful thinking. It instantly diminishes belief. And &ldquo;belief lite&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do the trick. <br/> <br/> Here&rsquo;s what I love about everyday winning. It isn&rsquo;t as clear-cut as a soccer score. Decide what your everyday wins look like. A great conversation with your boss? An inspired lunch with a client that opens the doors to new collaboration? A joyous date with your spouse where all discord is momentarily forgotten? <br/> <br/> Those are wins, aren&rsquo;t they? Can you believe in that sort of win? Sure you can. Channel the Viking within yourself. Believe without the gnawing doubt.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Prepare to win. </strong></h3><p> <br/> It may be an underdog story. It isn&rsquo;t a Cinderella story. Iceland didn&rsquo;t just, overnight, start to play championship soccer. In 2000, this tiny nation of 325,000 citizens faced the music. There was a reason why Iceland was then ranked #131 among the world&rsquo;s soccer nations. Because of its harsh winters, there simply wasn&rsquo;t enough time in the year for budding soccer players to hone their craft. Iceland built 7 state-of-the-art indoor soccer facilities. It built 150 outdoor soccer fields with in-ground heating. It trained over 600 elite-level coaches in their communities. <br/> <br/> No wishful thinking here. Wanna win? Prepare. Train and train and train some more. Train with rigor and commitment and joy. Get a coach. Set yourself up for the win. <br/> <br/> True for sports. True for business. True for life.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Play like there is nothing to lose. </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s the gift of being the underdog. The underdog doesn&rsquo;t have a thing to lose. The rest of us, we hedge our bets. We overthink. We get cautious and second-guess. We have one foot on the pedal. <br/> <br/> We play to not make a mistake. Play it safe. Don&rsquo;t play to win. <br/> <br/> Nurture your underdog mindset. When we play to not lose we preserve our status quo. We also don&rsquo;t get to the Elimination Rounds. And we sure as heck don&rsquo;t experience the gift of momentum or the thrill of the win.</p><p> Iceland didn&rsquo;t make it past France to the Round of 4. I am relieved. It would have played Germany, and my conscience would have been tested. But I cherish my Iceland lessons.</p><p> <strong>  Define your Wins. Believe you can Win. Prepare to Win. Play like there is nothing to Lose. </strong></p><p> Great underdog wisdom. And yet I forget. You forget.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s not.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-04 12:53:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-04 12:53:04.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_KEWMEvs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-iceland-taught-the-world/\", \"post_id\": \"12225\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-04 12:53:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-04 12:53:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-iceland-taught-the-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12224\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5940\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-Iceland-Taught-the-World.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"617\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467734400,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}

What can I do to get my website to show/drive traffic to it?&rdquo;</h3>You don&rsquo;t have complete control over where and how your website shows up in search engines, but you do have a lot more power and control than you might think. Improving your Search Engine Ranking and website traffic is a process that occurs from consistent effort applied over a longer period of time.So, let&rsquo;s dissect this question into 2 parts:<li> How can I make my website at the top of the search?</li><li> How can I drive more traffic to my website?</li>There&rsquo;s a lot that you can do to help improve your website&rsquo;s chances of showing at the top of search. The higher your website is in search engine rankings, the more traffic you will get to your website.<h3> <strong>  Google My Business </strong></h3>A starting point is to increase your local ranking through <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>  Google My Business </strong></a>. Google My Business is a Google service that connects individuals, who are searching online, with businesses in their neighbourhood. It helps you get your business hours, phone number, and directions on Google Search and Maps.You should also start by &ldquo;Googling&rdquo; your business. Do you see search results that look like the image below? Below is a search for &ldquo;Veriday&rdquo;. With this example, you can see 3 benefits of simply being listed on Google My Business &ndash; Veriday&rsquo;s address, interactive map, listing information, and directions when you &ldquo;send to my phone&rdquo;.  Google/customer reviews are also front and centre.<img alt=\"\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-search.png\" width=\"876\"/>It is very important to claim and optimize your Google My Business page.  As you know, 89 percent of consumers use search engines for purchase decisions. Google My Business is a critical component to ensuring your business shows up when people are searching for the products and services you offer. On top of helping your search engine rankings, your Google My Business Page show prospects your:<li> Location</li><li> Contact details</li><li> Business hours</li><li> Directions</li><li> Photos of your office</li><li> Other photos that you may want to upload to Google that show off your business or your people</li><li> Customer Reviews</li>For more information on Google My Business, check out our previous post <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-google-my-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>.<a href=\"http://www.google.com/business/\" target=\"_blank\"> Click here</a> to get started on setting up your Google My Business page.<h3> <strong>  Blogging </strong></h3>Blogging is perhaps the most effective way to increase your organic website traffic. Search engines, such as Google, are ranking websites that are continuously updated with fresh, new, and useful content, higher on the list of results. Google&rsquo;s goal is to provide the best search results for their customers and have determined that websites with more frequently updated, relevant content are more appealing and important to searchers. When Google &ldquo;crawlers&rdquo; come to audit your website to see if anything has changed, they report their findings back to Google. In addition, the crawlers are looking for relevant content. For example: A financial advisor website, with fresh and unique financial advice blogs, will have a better chance of ranking higher in search engines.81% online consumers trust information and advice from blogs (<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/BlogHer/2012-social-media-final-v2?ref=http://www.blogher.com/women-and-social-media-2012\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> BlogHer</a>). Blogging is one of the most effective ways to provide value to prospects and clients by answering questions they may have in a helpful and targeted way.Additionally, every positive experience that a user has with your website, or with an interesting &lsquo;share-able&rsquo; blog, increases the likelihood of them returning and referring people, driving more traffic to your website.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> <strong>  Optimizing Your Website for Search Engines </strong></h3>There is plenty you can do to boost search engine traffic to your website at no cost except your time. Below are some techniques to get you started on increasing your search engine ranking and driving traffic to your website:<strong>      1. Is your website mobile optimized?</strong>40% of people will choose another result if the first one they land on is not mobile friendly (<a href=\"https://www.sweor.com/blog-posts/8-staggering-statistics-about-responsive-web-design\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Sweor</a>). With mobile users exceeding desktop users, having a responsive Advisor website has never been more important. On top of that, Google&rsquo;s algorithm gives an additional search engine-ranking boost for mobile-friendly websites in the mobile search results.  The image below shows a website in search results that is deemed mobile-friendly.<img alt=\"\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mobile-friendly.png\" width=\"403\"/>Digital Agent users &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. All of your websites are <strong> 100% mobile friendly aka &ldquo;responsive&rdquo;</strong>.<strong>      2. Back-links</strong>A backlink is a hyperlink that links from someone else&rsquo;s web page, back to your website. Back-links are important for Google to determine the popularity or importance of your website. Remember, Google tries its best to rank websites in accordance with its relevance and importance to the searcher. How many people visit and &lsquo;recommend&rsquo; your site with a back-link is one way to determine how popular your website is.An easy way to create back-links is to ask partners to link to your site in return for you linking to their website. For example, links from recommended lawyers, mortgage brokers, real-estate agents, are not only relevant to your business but they improve your importance in the search engine world.<strong>      3. Use Meta Descriptions and Title Tags</strong>Meta descriptions provide a concise preview of a website page&rsquo;s content when it appears on search engine results page. Below is an example of a title with a Meta description under it.Meta descriptions must be short, unique and relevant. It&rsquo;s better to have a custom Meta description that instils curiosity in your audience and convinces them to click on your website in their search results. Try to include relevant keywords (the words you think your prospects are searching for) in both your Meta description and your title tag with each page of your website (including each blog you post).<strong>      4. Research Relevant Keywords</strong>What are people searching for when they are looking for your services? Use keywords on your website that are specific to your product or service. Over time, Google will identify your website or blog as a destination for that particular subject which will help boost your content and website in search engine rankings. However, ensure you are using your keywords appropriately and don&rsquo;t overuse them as Google can penalize you for <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/optimize-advisor-website-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> &ldquo;keyword stuffing&rdquo;.</a>Are you an Advisor in the Toronto region? If that&rsquo;s the case, you should try to use relevant keywords (such as &ldquo;Financial Advisor in Toronto Region&rdquo;) in your titles, Meta descriptions, ALT tags and so on.<strong>      5. Optimize your ALT tags for Images</strong>Research shows that coloured visuals increase a person&rsquo;s willingness to read a piece of content by 80% (<a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy?__hstc=241978781.d314c6925d3c7fdf386313d90eb73574.1463573944344.1467290624344.1467629475496.17&amp;__hssc=241978781.2.1467629475496&amp;__hsfp=3644121245#sm.00001bwrttk2hsct9rxyz93fpa1wh\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Hubspot</a>). It is also important to include alternative text tags, also known as ALT tags, so that Google can better understand the information on your site. &ldquo;A picture tells a thousand words&rdquo; is true, but Google cannot understand what the photos are about without ALT tags.<h3> <strong>  Social Media </strong></h3>Build a presence on social media networks like LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+ etc. All of these networks help to expand your reach, get your name, business and website address out there on the Internet. Sharing your website content and blog posts through social media accounts, like Twitter and LinkedIn, is a great way to push out your content, while driving traffic back to your website.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-04 13:01:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-04 13:01:56.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_nEU91iD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-how-to-drive-website-traffic-and-improve-search-engine-rankings/\", \"post_id\": \"12229\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-04 13:01:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-04 13:01:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-how-to-drive-website-traffic-and-improve-search-engine-rankings\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12226\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5941\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Advisors-How-to-Drive-Website-Traffic-and-Improve-Search-Engine-Rankings.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1143\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467709200,"author_id":268,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5706,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Importance of Sleep on Health and Mental Performance","link":"the-importance-of-sleep-on-health-and-mental-performance","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Holly DavisGenerally speaking, most adults need around seven to eight hours of sleep a night, but through factors such as insufficient time, distractions, and various medical conditions, one third of adults are suffering from sleep deprivation (SD), which can have negative effects on a person&rsquo;s mental and physical functions. While a prevalent issue, there are many ways to avoid or cope with SD, and lessen its effects on both body and mind.While there are many illnesses and disorders that effect sleep, insomnia is one of the leading causes of sleeplessness and can be a standalone condition. Insomnia is when a person is unable to fall, stay or even experience a restful, fulfilling sleep, reducing emotional intelligence and constructive thinking, while also affecting body weight, immune function, and much more. In more severe cases of insomnia, irregular heartbeats and skin disorders can be triggered or worsened.</p><h3> <strong>  Effects on the brain </strong></h3>Despite average sleep times being between 7 and 8 1/2 hours per day (Kripke et al 2002; Carskadon and Dement 2005; Kronholm et al 2006), The need for sleep is affected by many factors, and varies considerably between individuals (Shneerson 2000). Processes such as restitution of the body, energy conservation, and tissue healing are positively affected by sleep (Maquet 2001), and is essential for cognitive functions, predominantly memory consolidation (Maquet 2001; Stickgold 2005).Sleep deprivation has also been known to activate the sympathetic nervous system, leading to blood pressure rising (Ogawa et al 2003) and increased cortisol secretion (Spiegel et al 1999; Lac and Chamoux 2003). Over an extended period, immune response can be affected and metabolic changes such as insulin resistance have been known to occur (Spiegel et al 2005).Sleep deprivation may negatively affect sustained concentration, while also debilitating working memory.  Working memory can be divided into two distinct parts: visual working and verbal working memory.  Verbal memory encompassing fact recall from reading and listening, as visual memory encompasses our cognitive interactions with objects and shapes. Both are an important part of higher cognitive functioning, and both influence SD in different ways.Experiments have shown a difference between partial sleep deprivation and total sleep deprivation when it comes to their effect on visual working memory.  When a person is sleep deprived, the capacity is about the same as it is in a rested person, however the ability to move items into and out of visual working memory is degraded substantially in people with total deprivation.Through advanced imaging systems and behavioural tests, lower levels of blood-borne oxygen being delivered to important areas in the brain can be observed in sleep deprived patients over 24 hours.<h3> <strong>  Sleep and health </strong></h3>Sleep plays a vital role in your body&rsquo;s ability to heal and repair your blood vessels and heart, and poor sleep conditions can heighten the risk of chronic health problems like high blood pressure, heart disorders, and strokes. According to research from Harvard Medical School, one night without enough sleep can cause elevated blood pressure throughout the next day for individuals suffering from hypertension.Sleep deprivation means your body is unable to properly build its immune system. According to the Mayo Clinic, studies show that if a person doesn't get enough healthy sleep, their defences against bacteria and viruses will be weakened, and it can take them longer to recover from illness.A side effect of sleep deprivation is micro sleep, where an individual may uncontrollably lose consciousness for only a few seconds or a few minutes without realising. This can be extremely dangerous if you&rsquo;re driving, and make you more prone to accidents. According to research from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, unsatisfactory levels of sleep have played a tragic and easily avoidable part in accidents involving planes, ships, and nuclear reactor meltdowns to name a few.<img alt=\"\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/poor-sleep.png\" width=\"487\"/>Figure 1 General and common symptoms that suggest sleep deprivation (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/ozmattress.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> source</a>)Sleep debt can also be associated with clinical depression and other melancholic disorders, however there are no consistent bio-markers for sleep debt, so most formal diagnosis' have to be behavioural.A person who loses one night&rsquo;s sleep will generally be slow and easily agitated until restfulness is restored, and will either become easily fatigued or overly energetic thanks to Adrenalin. After missing two night&rsquo;s sleep, a person will have issues with concentration and will begin to make mistakes on basic tasks. Three missed nights and a person may begin to hallucinate and lose their sense of reality.Inflammation is associated with a number of long-term chronic illnesses such as heart problems and cancer, and sleeplessness has been known to heighten levels of inflammatory mediators. While is no smoking gun linking restricted sleep to these conditions, it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume poor sleep increases the chance of developing health problems.It may increase the severity of the chronic problems seen in conjunction with aging.  It affects carbohydrate metabolism the same way diabetes does (at least in the short run) and produces higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the evenings and generally more activity of the sympathetic nervous system.People with sleep debt also take more risks.  A test of sleep deprived card players found they correctly assessed the increased risk of certain bets in the same manner as their rested counterparts, but were more willing to place bets on the higher risk propositions.Although an unhealthy sleep cycle increases the risk factor for obesity, total sleep deprivation has been observed as leading to weight loss.  Animals that are subjected to extended sleeplessness lose weight at an increased rate, and anecdotally humans report feeling chills when forced to remain awake for extended periods. From this seemingly contradictory data, does sleeplessness lead to the losing or gaining of weight?  Scientific investigations have shown that humans use more energy during periods of SD, but that how much energy is used depends on the rate of sleeplessness.  In periods of total sleep deprivation, the brain accumulates sleep debt rapidly, and energy expenditure is heightened to a point that the animal or person will start to lose weight. In the more common situation of partial sleep deprivation, rate of extra energy expenditure is low and the body can usually accommodate for that which would be lost.Chronic short sleep, a form of partial sleep deprivation, leads to raised levels of body mass (as opposed to short-term total sleep deprivation where levels are seen to lower).<h3> <strong>  Set a routine before bed </strong></h3>It is widely suggested that sleep deprivation can simply be the result of a lack of a healthy routine. If you encounter sleep deprivation on an ongoing basis, it is advised to ensure this is not the prominent cause before seeking professional advice.<img alt=\"\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/healthy-sleep.png\" width=\"390\"/><i> Holly is a graduate in Biosciences from the UK and enjoys writing articles which can make science more easy to follow, allowing the public to stay more well informed.</i> References<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221845091_Energy_Drinks_Psychological_Effects_and_Impact_on_Well-being_and_Quality_of_Life-A_Literature_Review\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221845091_Energy_Drinks_Psychological_Effects_and_Impact_on_Well-being_and_Quality_of_Life-A_Literature_Review</a><a href=\"http://www.chagrinschools.org/Downloads/researcfhSleep%20deprivation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.chagrinschools.org/Downloads/researcfhSleep%20deprivation.pdf</a>http://www.ozmattress.com.au/essential-tips-getting-perfect-nights-sleep/http://postcog.ucd.ie/files/Hrrison%20and%20horne.pdf<a href=\"http://www.sleepdex.org/insufficient.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.sleepdex.org/insufficient.htm</a><a href=\"http://www.sleepdex.org/deficit.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.sleepdex.org/deficit.htm</a><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2656292/\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2656292/</a>Sleep Difficulties and Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Guide for Parents and ...By Kenneth J.

{"original_id":5707,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Must Do's To Fulfill Your Purpose","link":"4-must-dos-to-fulfill-your-purpose","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Ever since I did my first podcast titled,  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/first-thing-want-change-careers-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The First Thing To Do When You Want to Change Careers </a> , I&rsquo;ve been getting messages via social media and directly from people commenting they feel have clarity on what they want to do, but&hellip;</p><p> In that (first) episode, we talked about finding your purpose (and writing your headline). If you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/first-thing-want-change-careers-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  listen to that podcast </a> , it might be helpful to go to it or revisit it.</p><p> We talked about gaining clarity regarding what you want out of life and what you want to offer this world.</p><p> A lot of the comments I got from people mentioned they have clarity regarding what they want to do,  but can&rsquo;t seem to fulfill it . They can&rsquo;t seem to get it to work! I read, &ldquo;I feel like I know how, but I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I&rsquo;m not doing.&rdquo;</p><p> I thought as I was remarking back to these listeners and readers there are four (must do&rsquo;s) that absolutely have to be done in order to truly fulfill your purpose.</p><p> Before we dive in, I&rsquo;m going to assume you know what it is you want to offer this world. (If not,  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/first-thing-want-change-careers-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  see the first podcast </a>  for help.) Let&rsquo;s just say you have that clarity.</p><p> Most people, once they realize that clarity, immediately want to go into the &ldquo;how.&rdquo; How am I going to make this happen?</p><h3> <strong>  SACRIFICE  </strong> [First things first. You need to be willing to give up&mdash;a lot.]</h3><p> <br/> While that&rsquo;s a step I would recommend, it isn&rsquo;t the place I would start. The place I&rsquo;d start is with  <strong>  sacrifice </strong> .</p><p> Trust me when I tell you, determining how you&rsquo;ll fulfill your purpose will be much easier than dealing with what you&rsquo;re going to need to give up.</p><p> Do you want it badly enough you&rsquo;re willing to sacrifice for it?</p><p> Before you concern yourself with how you&rsquo;re going to get it done, take stock. If you&rsquo;re unwilling to sacrifice in order to overcome the obstacles and all you&rsquo;ll need to learn and all you&rsquo;ll need to do to become proficient, you&rsquo;re never going to make it happen.</p><p> This is the first and probably most common issue that derails anybody from achieving anything. Whether that&rsquo;s living their purpose or achieving their goals.</p><p> So, the first thing you need to do is make sure you&rsquo;re not only clear regarding what you&rsquo;ll sacrifice, but also actually follow through and sacrifice it.</p><p> This could be a hobby, time with your friends, or dinners out. This could be whatever you do to enjoy life. Maybe, even what you think are &ldquo;necessities.&rdquo;</p><p> In order to do something big with yourself, you&rsquo;re going to have to give up big things.</p><p> You are bigger than you can imagine. What you have to offer this world is bigger than you can imagine. It really is.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll need to accept. Of all the people in your life you touch or make a profound impact on&hellip;most of them will never even let you know you made a great impact on their life.</p><p> Trust me when I tell you, the things you&rsquo;re doing, whatever they are, however innocuous you think they are, they are impacting people.</p><p> You might find out months later or years later. You may never find out. But, you have to trust that what you&rsquo;re doing is worth it and you need to be willing to sacrifice in order to give it to the world.</p><p> I think about what I sacrifice in my life to make sure you can get my message. It&rsquo;s worth it to me.</p><h3> <strong>  LEARN  </strong> [You never stop being a student.]</h3><p> <br/> The second must do is understanding and accepting the fact you are going to need to learn things you don&rsquo;t know. Not only are you going to have to learn things you don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;ll also have to keep learning new ways to do things you already know how to do!</p><p> Are you willing to learn and adjust?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what happens. You decide [your purpose] and what you want to offer the world. You decide what you&rsquo;re going to accomplish. You decide your goals.</p><p> Then you start learning and become proficient. Then you&rsquo;re cruising along and start to see you&rsquo;re really contributing value to the world.</p><p> Then as soon as you get proficient&hellip;bang! The world changes.</p><p> It&rsquo;s bad enough there are obstacles simply to learn what you need to learn. It&rsquo;s bad enough people aren&rsquo;t going to cooperate and life&rsquo;s not going to cooperate.</p><p> On top of that, the world is going to change. That&rsquo;s a given. It&rsquo;s going to evolve. It&rsquo;s going to present new ways for you to deliver whatever it is you&rsquo;re delivering and you&rsquo;re going to need to make changes. That&rsquo;s a given. The only thing that isn&rsquo;t a given is what you&rsquo;re going to do about it.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a great acid test. It&rsquo;s something I ask myself before I undertake something because I want to give it my best.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a huge difference between a passing interest and a deep desire to do something, accomplish something, or be part of something.</p><p> What I do before undertake it&mdash;to know whether or not I will take it to fulfillment&mdash;is ask myself, &ldquo;Am I willing to struggle when it gets hard? Will I be okay with that? Will I deal with the struggles, whether they&rsquo;re daily, monthly, or yearly?&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;re willing to struggle, I promise you there is a deep desire because that&rsquo;s the huge difference.</p><p> People have lots of interests and it&rsquo;s great when all is going well. But, as soon as something goes wrong, they stop. They throw in the towel. They give up. They let go.</p><p> Sure, they were interested (at one point), but they didn&rsquo;t have a deep desire.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a great example. I love writing. I wish I could just write everything, shoot it out into the world. Have you read it and get those great takeaways.</p><p> No. The world says, &ldquo;Hang on. People want to see things differently. They [actually] want to see it on video. They want it coming through their ear buds. They don&rsquo;t have time to read. They want to listen while they&rsquo;re driving.&rdquo;</p><p> All of these new inventions and technologies we&rsquo;ve created are wonderful. They allow us to meet and access more people. But, this also means I have to create products and messages that use different mediums. That requires extra work.</p><p> That&rsquo;s more painful, BUT I feel like what I have to share with you is important. You&rsquo;re important to me. Getting this message to you is important to me!</p><p> Whether there&rsquo;s only one of you listening or a hundred or a thousand or a hundred thousand. I think this message is important. I hope you learn something from it. If I&rsquo;m able to touch one person, I&rsquo;m going to go to great lengths to transfer my message. Hopefully that person&rsquo;s life will be changed.</p><p> You are going to need to think about this. It matters.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  BELIEVE  </strong> [You must believe in yourself no matter what.]</h3><p> <br/> The third must do comes even when you have clarity, ever though you struggle, and even though you&rsquo;re becoming proficient. It asks, &ldquo;Will you continually believe in yourself no matter what? Will succeed no matter what it takes, no matter what the world throws at you, no matter the challenges you encounter. Do you believe? Do you trust your own ability to figure it out? Will you overcome those obstacles?&rdquo;</p><p> There&rsquo;s a great quote, I&rsquo;m sure many of you have heard. No truer words have ever been spoken than the ones by Henry Ford who said, &ldquo;Whether you think you can or you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter how proficient you are or how much skill you have. If you don&rsquo;t believe in your ability to make it happen, you won&rsquo;t.</p><p> That&rsquo;s number three. Will you believe in yourself no matter what?</p><h3> <strong>  FOCUS </strong>  [With a vision, your why, and the how, you&rsquo;ll be focused.]</h3><p> <br/> The fourth must do really troubles people, especially in our world today and the speed at which everything changes. You have so much coming at you through the television, through the radio, through the Internet, through the social sites. There are constant distractions.</p><p> Will you remain focused because your love for fulfilling that purpose is greater than anything else that enters your life?</p><p> You have clarity and are willing to learn. You will overcome the challenges. But, as those daily surprises and opportunities surface, will you be able to remain focused? Will you remember why you got into this in the first place? Can you remove the noise?</p><p> You can try to swat away the obstacles, but there are actually three [reasons] you stay focused.</p><li> You have strategy and you have a vision. [If you understand your why and you understand your purpose, I assume you have that.]</li><li> The &ldquo;why&rdquo; you want to make that happen is the second key ingredient. Many times people forget their why. It makes them lose focus.</li><li> The how. Do you have a map? If you have a map, the map will help you weather the storm.</li><p> Focus is really about staying true to all you&rsquo;ve already developed.</p><p> What is your purpose? Why is that important to you? How will you achieve it?</p><p> You&rsquo;ve already developed this. By the time you encounter these focal distractions, you have all the tools necessary to overcome them.</p><p> Even so, common sense does not mean common practice. In this case, this wasn&rsquo;t all common sense, but there was sense to what you did and what you put together and why you put it together and the reasons you got engaged in whatever it was in the first place.</p><p> Once you have clarity around your why and what you want to offer the world and how you want to give it to them, it comes down to being able to sacrifice those things that might enjoyments or &ldquo;necessities&rdquo; or whatever. But, you need to be willing to give those up.</p><p> Are you willing to learn and continually learn whatever it is you don&rsquo;t know?</p><p> Then, once you do know it, are you willing to adjust to better ways of doing it?</p><p> Will you believe in yourself no matter what?</p><p> Will you stay focused?</p><p> If you can do this, I think you&rsquo;ll be very, very effective at fulfilling your purpose!</p><p> As always, I&rsquo;ve got some show notes, extra reading, and links to articles. I hope this really helps. For me, it&rsquo;s about doing those four things everyday. Until next week, have a great one.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-04 13:47:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-04 13:47:43.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_EmzMeGp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-must-dos-to-fulfill-your-purpose/\", \"post_id\": \"12237\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-04 13:47:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-04 13:47:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-must-dos-to-fulfill-your-purpose\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12236\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5944\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/4-Must-Do\\u2019s-To-Fulfill-Your-Purpose.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"332\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467720000,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5708,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Transfer of Trust Matters More Than Ever Before","link":"the-transfer-of-trust-matters-more-than-ever-before","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  The prospecting method that keeps on delivering the most opportunities is Referrals. </strong></p><p> <strong>  A distant second in the source of new clients for advice firms is Centre of Influence referrals. </strong></p><p> Research by the Financial Planning Association showed that on average in the previous year some 34% of new clients came from client referrals.  About 16% of the new clients on average came from COI referrals, meaning in total that 50% of all new clients came from a  <strong>  transfer of trust </strong>  to begin with.  Given that the next highest source of new clients for firms was acquisition (at just under 10%) and the rest made up of a myriad of other prospecting methods, the research suggests that when it comes to getting the best ROI from your prospecting dollars then focussing on referral generation will deliver the best results.</p><p> Usually when the idea of &ldquo;focussing on referrals&rdquo; arises the thinking zero&rsquo;s in on &ldquo;focussing on extracting more names&rdquo; though.  That is, the emphasis seems to be on how can one can get a better short term result in referral generation from existing clients.  Incentives&hellip;gifts&hellip;.rewards&hellip;.ideas to get attention and appeal to personal greed on the part of the potential referrer typically become the focus.</p><p> That type of thinking is generally a bad move, as it only tackles one of the requirements for getting more referrals &ndash; and it targets the wrong type of clients usually anyway.  Generating a consistent stream of quality referralsto the right sort of clients by your existing clients, requires that your potential referrers have a significant level of trust.  Not just trust in the professionals&rsquo; expertise and competency, but trust in the professionals&rsquo; integrity and manner.  Clients being asked to refer their friends and family are exposing their own reputations and relationships when they do refer, and they are being asked to place those in the hands of the professional.</p><p> Good clients who will provide good referrals to the right sort of clients then are rarely motivated to do so because of a dinner voucher or some similar &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; in my experience.  Certainly such incentives achieve the purpose of obtaining attention and creating an awareness of the desire to be referred, however they tend to create interest with the wrong clients.   <strong>  Think about it </strong> : how strong is the relationship that someone is willing to put at risk for a dinner voucher?  How likely is it then that the referred person in such a case will be truly open to the approach of the professional?  How likely is it that you are actually getting high quality referrals from those motivated by a free dinner?</p><p> Incentives and reward schemes for referral generation have merit in that they create awareness, and for that reason they are worth considering as apart of a professional services firms marketing strategy.  However they are at best  <strong>  only a part of the process </strong>  of creating repeated referrals from clients.  Maintaining awareness of the desire to be referred matters.</p><p> However ongoing and repeated positive introductions from clients to other potential clients requires continual reinforcement of the trustworthiness of the professional.

{"original_id":5711,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"11 Ways Technology Makes You a Better Advisor","link":"11-ways-technology-makes-you-a-better-advisor","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Most advisors are aware there are many powerful advisor-focused technology solutions on the market.</h3><p> <br/> Some advisors are already leveraging technology, or if they aren&rsquo;t, know they should be. But you shouldn&rsquo;t be jumping on the tech bandwagon just because everyone else is! First, it&rsquo;s important to understand how technology sets you apart from other advisors. Technology increases your efficiency, creates opportunities, and enhances the service you provide your clients. Read on to see all the ways great technology can make you a better advisor.</p><h3> 1. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THE BAD GUY ANYMORE</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s nothing worse than having to tell a client they&rsquo;ve misallocated their assets. But with a handy tech solution, you don&rsquo;t have to be the bearer of bad news anymore. You can use tools like performance reports or a client portal to show your clients issue areas. Then, you can assure them you have a proactive solution which will remedy the situation. With tech, you no longer have to focus on discussing problems, and can focus on the positive instead.</p><h3> 2. STREAMLINED MEETINGS</h3><p> <br/> Imagine if you had access to data on every piece of your client&rsquo;s financial life. With data aggregation and account management tools you can see your client&rsquo;s holistic financial position. This means that during a meeting you can smoothly transition from one topic to the next, and if your client has a question you can quickly find the information you need to address it without fumbling through a pile of paperwork.</p><h3> 3. BETTER FINANCIAL DECISIONS</h3><p> <br/> With data aggregation tools, it&rsquo;s easy to see a complete picture of your client&rsquo;s financial picture alongside important financial milestones. Because you have all the data, you can make more informed financial decisions. Clients benefit when you have all the facts!</p><h3> 4. STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS</h3><p> <br/> Technology can help you foster better relationships with your clients. CRM tools keep all your client&rsquo;s information in one place. Some CRMs even support notifications for important financial milestones. This makes it easy to know which of your clients are approaching retirement, saving for their child&rsquo;s education, etc. With tech, you stay on top of your client&rsquo;s evolving life, so you can provide the best service possible.</p><h3> 5. APPEARANCES</h3><p> <br/> As an advisor you want to appear knowledgeable and competent to your clients. If you use technology, clients are more likely to see you as savvy and in-the-know. Conversely, advisors who fail to effectively use technology may appear outdated to potential clients. Technology showcases your efficiency and shows clients that you&rsquo;re in touch with their needs.</p><h3> 6. MAKE MORE TIME FOR THE IMPORTANT STUFF</h3><p> <br/> Technology can streamline your operations, so you spend less time on tasks like billing, performance reporting, and onboarding. This creates time for more valuable tasks like building relationships with clients and business development.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 7. INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY</h3><p> <br/> Technology makes it easier than ever before for you and your clients to stay in touch. For many clients, accessibility is an important factor when choosing an advisor. CRM software, client experience management platforms, and virtual meeting devices make you more accessible.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 8. INTELLIGENT DATA HELPS YOU MAKE SMART DECISIONS</h3><p> <br/> Today's top tech solutions are powered by intelligent data. This means that it's easy to track your technology's performance and see how your tech is impacting your firm. These metrics can help you see in which areas your firm is exceeding or falling short of your expectations. This information can help you make smarter business decisions.</p><h3> 9. INCREASE TRANSPARENCY</h3><p> <br/> Many advisors are now working with Gen Y, and this generation is more skeptical of financial advice than previous ones. In order to combat this, transparency is key. Great technology can make being transparent with your clients easier than ever. With on-demand billing reports and custom-generated fee structures, it's easy to be transparent.</p><h3> 10. COLLABORATE WITH CLIENTS</h3><p> <br/> Nowadays, many people are choosing to manage their own finances rather than work with an advisor. This is because some people want to play an active role in the management of their wealth. Technology can help you attract clients who want to play a role in their money&rsquo;s management. Client portals allow clients to view their financial position, and some even support the ability for clients to create and manage financial goals and milestones. These tools will help you attract clients who see investment management as a collaborative effort.</p><h3> 11. VIRTUAL MEETINGS</h3><p> <br/> Advisors who use virtual meeting technologies have many advantages over other advisors. For starters, they&rsquo;re not limited to working with clients in their immediate geographic area. Virtual advisors can attract potential clients from all over the country. Also, if one of your current clients relocates, you can continue to work with them virtually. Clients enjoy working with advisors who offer the flexibility of virtual meetings. Who doesn&rsquo;t want to skip driving to the office and sitting through an hour-long meeting? Both you and your clients benefit from virtual meetings, which are more efficient and convenient.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-05 14:07:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-05 14:07:54.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_jKO3IS5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/11-ways-technology-makes-you-a-better-advisor/\", \"post_id\": \"12247\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-05 14:07:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-05 14:07:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"11-ways-technology-makes-you-a-better-advisor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12246\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5948\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/11-Ways-Technology-Makes-You-a-Better-Advisor.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"511\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467792000,"author_id":90,"chart_url":""}

These folks understand that they can have almost complete control of their future and are focused on being the master of their circumstances, as opposed to a victim of them. They take the time to think through and develop a clear picture of where they or their organization needs to be no more than three years from the present. They then work each day to make their vision a reality. There are, of course, setbacks and barriers. However, the clarity of their vision, perseverance and self-discipline allows them to push through anything that gets in their way to achieve success.</p><p> I also recommend that when you create your vision you keep these two key points in the forefront of your mind:</p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t think of your vision as a rigid, &ldquo;final product&rdquo; with every detail pinned down.</h3><p> <br/> Think of it more as a series of guideposts of key topics to focus attention on and targets to aim for; and</p><h3> 2. Regularly review your vision, evaluate it, and revise it as needed.</h3><p> <br/> Keep questioning your assumptions. Stay flexible and open to change.</p><p> Your vision does not have to be perfect to get started. I recently heard a speaker say that it can be like driving your car, cross country, on a dark road at night and you can only see as far as the end of the light cast by your headlights. While you can&rsquo;t see very far ahead, and the conditions are far from perfect, you can make the entire trip that way if you stay focused and keep moving forward. Don&rsquo;t let what you can&rsquo;t see hold you back from creating your vision for the first part of your journey.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-05 14:30:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-05 14:30:38.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_0d6Atne.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-one-quality-that-all-who-successfully-play-big-have-in-common/\", \"post_id\": \"12249\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-05 14:30:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-05 14:30:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-one-quality-that-all-who-successfully-play-big-have-in-common\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12248\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5949\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-One-Quality-That-All-Who-Successfully-Play-BIG-Have-in-Common.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"515\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467831600,"author_id":109,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5715,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Analyzing How Brexit Could Affect EU Sanctions Against Russia","link":"analyzing-how-brexit-could-affect-eu-sanctions-against-russia","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Brexit has dominated world headlines for the last couple of weeks, and with good reason: The U.K.&rsquo;s historic referendum has already roiled markets around the globe; raised serious questions about immigration, trade and diplomacy; cast a harsh spotlight on the EU&rsquo;s avalanche of rules and regulations; and divided member states on the best way forward. Among other far-reaching consequences, Brexit could end up causing Europe to rethink its sanctions policy against Russia, following a vote in Brussels last week to extend them another six months.</p><p> Nearly everyone agrees that Russia and President Vladimir Putin are among the winners because of Brexit. The U.K. is the EU&rsquo;s most vocal critic of Russia&rsquo;s 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and was instrumental in the decision to levy sanctions against the country&rsquo;s financials, energy and defense sectors two years ago.</p><p> Several EU countries, including Austria and Hungary, have expressed interest in lifting, or at least softening, sanctions, as they can no longer afford to miss out on trade with Russia. Countries that have faced difficulty offsetting lost trade opportunities are Finland, Poland and the Baltic states&mdash;Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The French parliament recently adopted a resolution to urge Brussels to drop all sanctions. Italy&rsquo;s Upper House of Parliament, meanwhile, approved a resolution opposing any automatic renewal of sanctions.</p><p> Britain&rsquo;s exclusion from any future policy decision-making, then, could help Moscow&rsquo;s chances to renegotiate terms.</p><p> In the long term, this bodes well for Russia&rsquo;s economy, which has been hammered by not just sanctions but also falling oil prices during the last two years. In 2013, energy accounted for 70 percent of all exports, with crude alone representing a third. What&rsquo;s helped keep oil producers profitable is the weakened ruble, which has lowered labor costs while making exports more competitive.</p><h3> Double Whammy: Sanctions and Low Oil Prices <br/>  </h3><p> Estimates vary as to which has done more damage to the country&rsquo;s currency&mdash;sanctions or the drop in Brent oil. As I&rsquo;ve pointed out before, there&rsquo;s a clear correlation between the ruble and oil prices.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/which-have-hurt-russian-ruble-more-brent-prices-or-sanctions.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> But sanctions have made their own significant impact. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), trade restrictions were responsible for a 1.5 percent decline in Russia&rsquo;s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015, with the effects intensifying the longer they&rsquo;re in place. The Economic Expert Group, a Russian fiscal policy consultancy, estimates that between 2014 and 2017, international sanctions and the plunge in oil prices will cost Russia a whopping $600 billion. A large percent of this includes capital flight, though we&rsquo;ve seen its rate slow since sanctions were first announced. Renaissance Capital believes $45 billion will leave the country this year, an improvement from the $64 billion lost in 2015 and $125 billion in 2014.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/foreign-direct-investment-in-russia-has-declined-dramatically-because-of-sanctions.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Exports have likewise taken a huge hit.

A business with great cash flow </p><p> B. An owner with a comprehensive Exit Plan </p><p> C. An advisor skilled in Exit Planning </p><p> D. Transferable value </p><p> If you picked D (without looking at the title of this article), you are smarter than I was 25 years ago. It only took me 25 years of creating Exit Plans for business owners to understand and appreciate its significance. If you disagree, consider the following story of one Exit Planner&rsquo;s interaction with &ldquo;Lester,&rdquo; the owner of a consulting company with clients across the globe. </p><p> Several years ago Lester walked into my office to ask me how much I thought he could sell his business for.  By way of introduction, he told me two things: </p><li> He made (between salary and S distributions) over $1,000,000 per year. </li><li> He was burned-out and ready to leave his business as soon as he could sell it.  <br/>  </li><p> &ldquo;So John,&rdquo; Lester started, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking it will sell for at least five times earnings or $5,000,000.&rdquo; </p><p> Not knowing enough to formulate an answer I asked him to tell me more about his business and his role in it. </p><li> Lester Enterprises (LE) was a well-known management consulting firm that designed and implemented management systems for international companies worldwide. </li><li> Lester&rsquo;s only role was to secure the consulting engagements while approximately 25 consultants (working in different locations across the globe) performed the actual consulting.  <br/>  </li><p> At first glance Lester Enterprises was a valuable company&mdash;consistent cash flow, great customers, capable consultants. But when I asked Lester who currently managed the consultants and would stay after he left? Lester just looked at me. </p><p> Lester explained that LE&rsquo;s consultants were not employees but independent contractors. LE not only had no management team, it had only one part-time employee&mdash;a bookkeeper/receptionist. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m sticking around long enough to find and train someone to replace me!&rdquo;  </p><p> It was my turn to do some explaining, &ldquo;Lester, without you, there is no one to oversee projects or obtain them. Without you, your business is worthless.&rdquo; </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The price Lester paid for not having developed transferable value was steep.  As soon as the last engagement was complete, he shut down the company. With no transferable value, there were no buyers and Lester's income plummeted from $1 million+ to $0 overnight.  </p><p> Is this an extreme example? Maybe. But it is entirely accurate in illustrating how a company with consistent annual cash flow/EBITDA of $1,000,000 has absolutely no transferable value when no management team exists to replace the departing owner. </p><h3> Can You Define Transferable Value? <br/>  </h3><p> Let&rsquo;s skip the multiple-choice quiz: Transferable value is what a business is worth, to someone else, without its current owner.  </p><p> No matter which exit path an owner chooses, transferable value is the common denominator of a successful exit. Think about it: </p><li> Why would insiders be willing to acquire a company (pledging personal assets) if they can&rsquo;t run the business without the current owner? </li><li> If children are not capable of continuing a business successfully, passing it on to them is a recipe for disaster. </li><li> Third-party buyers know that owners will be leaving the company when they sell it so exactly what are they buying if the business is the owner?  <br/>  </li><h3> Transferable value also has a huge impact an owner&rsquo;s goals and family:  <br/>  </h3><li> If the owner dies today, they cannot expect a business with no transferable value to provide their families any income. </li><li> Without the ability to prosper without its owner, a business cannot help owners to achieve any of their values-based goals (e.g. preserving their legacies, maintaining their company&rsquo;s culture, and benefitting their communities). <br/>  </li><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Determining Transferable Value: Don&rsquo;t Take My Word For It  <br/>  </h3><p> Owners have their view of transferable value but it is buyers&mdash;specifically Private Equity Groups (PEGs)&mdash;who are the arbiters of value. That applies even if an owner plans to transfer a business to insiders or a sell to a strategic buyer.  PEGs (generally financial buyers) remain the gold standard of valuators because, unlike insiders, PEGs buy companies based on their experience, competition with other experienced buyers, and a thorough examination of a potential acquisition. </p><p> Before you dismiss the idea that PEGs determine value because your clients&rsquo; companies are too small, remember that every buyer, big or small, wants the same qualities in a business that professional buyers require. </p><h3> Elements of Transferable Value  <br/>  </h3><p> BEI advisors refer to the characteristics buyers require as &ldquo;value drivers.&rdquo; It is the strength of a company&rsquo;s value drivers that determines, in large measure, the value of a company. When they are present and functioning well, buyers will pay top dollar for a company because value drivers contribute to increased cash flow. </p><p> A company with strong value drivers can demand (and receive) a higher multiple on the same amount of EBITDA than can a company with average value drivers. </p><p> Before listing the drivers, remember that if owners are vital to the success of their companies in any one of these areas, they haven&rsquo;t built transferable value. As an Exit Planning advisor, you must lead them to re-examine that aspect of their role in their company. </p><h3> Top Nine Value Drivers <br/>  </h3><li> Next-Level Management  </li><li> Operating Systems Demonstrated to Increase Sustainability of Cash Flows  </li><li> Diversified Customer Base </li><li> Proven Growth Strategy  </li><li> Recurring Revenue That Is Sustainable and Resistant to &ldquo;Commoditization&rdquo; </li><li> Good and Improving Cash Flow </li><li> Demonstrated Scalability </li><li> Competitive Advantage </li><li> Financial Foresight and Controls  <br/>  </li><p> In the next article in this series, we will explain why next-level management is the most important value driver. The others appear in the order that BEI members have found to be the most likely to affect transferable value.  </p><h3> Can This Wait?  <br/>  </h3><p> Given that the sooner owners begin to improve their companies&rsquo; value drivers, the more they benefit, why would you wait? If you wait to help owners to begin building transferable value until they tell you that they are emotionally prepared to leave, there are several problems. </p><p> First, they (and you!) still have to do all the same work necessary to build value. That work will take just as much time as if you start today, but once owners reach their I&rsquo;m-ready-point, there&rsquo;s a high probability that the passion and drive they had before that point has evaporated. </p><p> Second, owners who wait to build transferable value, forfeit years of increased cash flow. </p><p> Third, waiting owners also forfeit a better ownership experience. Why? Because the heart of increasing transferable value is making the owner replaceable while increasing cash flow. Ask owners which tasks they find uninteresting or unpleasant and if at all possible, transfer those to others first.   </p><p> Finally, waiting to build transferable value until owners feel ready to leave limits their exit path options and increases the difficulty of the obstacles they will encounter because they don't have the time for you to initiate alternative growth strategies (e.g. replacing non-performing management).  </p><p> Perhaps your clients aren&rsquo;t like Lester, the sole creators of value in their companies. I&rsquo;d be surprised, however, if they all have companies that can run smoothly&mdash;permanently&mdash;without them. Installing and enhancing value drivers creates a company that can be transferred to another&mdash;without the owner&mdash;with minimal disruption to its cash flow. You can&rsquo;t create successful Exit Plans for owners unless you help them to create companies with transferable value. </p><p> In subsequent articles we&rsquo;ll describe the tools and plan designs you can use to enhance the drivers of transferable value. </p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-05 16:11:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-05 16:11:32.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_j9LHJi5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/transferable-value-the-most-important-element-in-an-owners-successful-exit/\", \"post_id\": \"12260\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-05 16:11:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-05 16:11:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"transferable-value-the-most-important-element-in-an-owners-successful-exit\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12259\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5953\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Transferable-Value-The-Most-Important-Element-in-an-Owners-Successful-Exit.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1144\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467799200,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5717,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Incompatible Objectives With the Independent Broker-Dealer World","link":"4-incompatible-objectives-with-the-independent-broker-dealer-world","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> One advisor learns that there&rsquo;s more to independence than what he had in the IBD world. <br/>  </h3><p> Independent broker-dealers (IBDs) serve a great purpose within the marketplace. By allowing advisors to own their business, self-brand and take control of their financial destiny, IBDs are often a breath of fresh air for breakaway brokers and entrepreneurial spirits. Further, IBDs serve as &ldquo;incubators&rdquo; for startup businesses that fall below the minimum requirements for wirehouses or are too commission oriented for the RIA space. Advisors are all the happier to share a percentage of their revenues with their broker-dealer in exchange for support in compliance, operations, technology, investments and practice management.</p><p> Yet while there are MANY multi-million dollar businesses within IBDs, there are often instances where a business has outgrown this model in favor of the registered investment advisor (RIA) hybrid space.</p><p> The RIA space has undergone a rapid expansion over the last number of years as advisors exiting the brokerage space have sought greater autonomy, flexibility and control over their businesses. In an RIA model, fee-based assets are held at an institutional custodian (i.e., Schwab, Fidelity, Pershing, TD, Raymond James) and commission assets (and securities licenses) are held at a friendly broker-dealer which is only compensated for the business which runs through it.</p><p> Take Will for example: A 20 year veteran of his IBD, managing over $400mm on behalf of his 600 relationships. Will began his career at his broker-dealer and found great support and empowerment throughout his years at the firm. For the last few years though, as the regulatory environment has changed, tough markets have stymied organic growth and more and more of his peers left the firm, Will started to think long and hard about whether he was in the best place for the sustained health of his business. After thought and consideration, Will decided that the RIA space was the best place for him and his clients based on his 4 primary objectives that he saw as incompatible with the IBD world:</p><h3> 1) Serve as true fiduciary  <br/>  </h3><p> By definition, advisors sitting under a broker-dealer operate in accordance with the suitability standard as opposed to the fiduciary standard in RIA space. While most IBD advisors already act in the fiduciary mindset, a true fiduciary separates product manufacturing, advice and safe asset custody&mdash;three mandates that can only be satisfied as an RIA.</p><h3> 2) Customize Infrastructure  <br/>  </h3><p> IBDs provide technology, compliance support, operations and many other value-add services. They do so, however, for hundreds or thousands of advisors, making customization and evolution quite difficult. Many are perfectly happy paying a few bps for a &ldquo;plug and play&rdquo; environment, but those who value the ultimate freedom, flexibility and control may find the RIA space to be a better fit. For example, Will wanted to implement the latest versions of Salesforce, E-money and ORION; however, these systems were incompatible with his BD&rsquo;s proprietary technology stack. Additionally, although Will ran a clean and compliant business, he had to follow policies meant to corral a few bad apples. Like Will, many advisors look to the RIA space to build a custom compliance organization (with a dedicated or outsourced CCO) that best suits their business. For some, optionality and compliance control isn&rsquo;t a plus, though, because it requires a lot of effort and responsibility.</p><h3> 3) Recruit and acquire <br/>  </h3><p> Quite possibly the greatest benefit of being independent is the ability to recruit and acquire advisors or practices based on the premise of operating leverage. As fixed costs stay relatively stable, each incremental dollar of cash flow hits the bottom-line. While there were thousands of targets within Will&rsquo;s IBD, there was intense competition from larger and well capitalized OSJs and independent businesses. Additionally, Will&rsquo;s efforts to attract top advisors from other IBDs, wirehouses and RIAs came up short as this would require prospects to change their BD affiliation or move back into IBD land from the RIA space&mdash;a generally unattractive proposition. As an RIA, however, the pool of recruits and M&amp;A targets instantly grows to include all IBDs, existing RIAs and captive firm advisors.</p><h3> 4) Maximize enterprise value <br/>  </h3><p> By leveraging an existing infrastructure and effectively sharing services, independent reps (especially those under an OSJ) save time, frustration and capital. This is done, however, at the expense of creating a sustainable business that can operate without the support of an IBD. While Will was in his early 40s and had no intention of selling his business, he was a savvy businessman who would one day want to take some chips off the table at a maximum enterprise valuation. Will also knew from industry colleagues that sophisticated buyers from the private equity, RIA and hybrid-RIA worlds typically looked outside an IBD thus limiting the pool of prospective buyers and suppressing market valuation. Bottom-line, when Will goes to sell his business down the line a buyer will pay more as an RIA.</p><p> While the RIA space was the best choice for Will based on his long term goals, for many, an IBD provides the perfect backdrop to grow a business and leave a legacy. Truth be told, Will wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to build the business he has today without the support and resources of his IBD. Yet it didn&rsquo;t provide him with what he needed to grow his business into the real enterprise he envisioned for the future. So the real question for independent advisors remains: Just how entrepreneurial and motivated are you to build an enterprise that will meet your goals not just for now, but for your future as well?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-05 16:22:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-05 16:22:16.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_GUROJXz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-incompatible-objectives-with-the-independent-broker-dealer-world/\", \"post_id\": \"12262\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-05 16:22:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-05 16:22:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-incompatible-objectives-with-the-independent-broker-dealer-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12261\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5954\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/4-Incompatible-Objectives-With-the-Independent-Broker-Dealer-World.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1141\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467813600,"author_id":313,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5719,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do Happy Customers Make Better Customer Experiences?","link":"do-happy-customers-make-better-customer-experiences","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I make no secret of the fact that I am a fan of &lsquo;old fashioned values&rsquo; in the delivery of great Customer Experiences.</p><p> Championed by the most customer-centric brands in the world, such as the Ritz Carlton, the importance yet simplicity of &lsquo;pleases&rsquo; and &lsquo;thank yous&rsquo; cannot be underestimated in the effect they can have on customers and the way they are made to feel in their daily interactions with organisations and their people. I have written about this subject in the past &ndash; yet I assure you this blog post is not a rehash of previous ramblings. I want to tackle the subject from the other way round &ndash; not employees or staff displaying politeness and good manners to customers, but customers doing exactly the same thing to employees.</p><p> I am writing this post at 38,000 feet on my way to Kenya. This morning I have personally crossed paths with approximately 20 people who were working for companies delivering my &lsquo;end to end&rsquo; Customer Experience. From the taxi who took me to the airport; to the lady at the check-in desk; to the staff manning security; to the bus driver who transferred me and others from one terminal to another. When you think about it, we (the customer) come across so many people every day, that we (the customer) are almost certainly guilty of not really noticing these people as well as taking them for granted.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> As I often do, I very consciously observed the way customers were communicating with the employees they crossed paths with. What I observed was not particularly heart-warming. 90% of the people I saw did not even acknowledge the employees that were a part of their experience. Sitting in the British Airways Lounge at Manchester airport, a man was clearing away breakfast plates and coffee cups. Not a single customer thanked him. Not a single customer even looked at him &ndash; except me of course. When I did look at him with a smile and said &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;, he was almost as shocked as I would have been if he had presented me with a complimentary bottle of Dom Perignon! Although he was shocked, the smile he gave me back made me feel great &ndash; I know it would have had a lasting effect on him today.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Last week I was on a train travelling from London to Chester. I was fortunate enough to be travelling with my wife, Naomi (not something that happens often enough!). We struck up a conversation with one of the train staff. Vickie was lovely &ndash; in fact a joy to talk to &ndash; our being nice to her (displaying simple old-fashioned values) made our customer experience far better than normal &ndash; in fact it made our experience memorable. I therefore pose the following question &ndash; do happy customers make better Customer Experiences?</p><p> This morning, going through airport security at Heathrow terminal 3, it was quite shocking to see how rude and obnoxious customers were being. Pushing, shouting, ignoring, swearing &ndash; it was embarrassing to watch. Most of the time we are so wrapped up in our own little worlds that even if we do not behave this way ourselves, we do not appreciate sometimes how customers are treating employees &ndash; focus on this in your daily interactions tomorrow &ndash; it is fascinating and disturbing. I believe in treating people the way I would like to be treated myself. I acknowledge and smile and greet as a matter of principle. Nine times out of ten, good old-fashioned values from the customer will be returned in spades from an employee. I firmly believe that if you behave nicely as a customer, you are far more likely to have a better Customer Experience &ndash; it is not rocket science &ndash; yet it is astonishing how many people do not seem to understand this.</p><p> You may have heard about the French coffee shop whose actions went viral &ndash; they offer a discount on coffee depending on how polite you are willing to be &ndash; what a WONDERFUL idea! I always tell the story about the time I visited a coffee shop in London called Pret a Manger. Pret (for short) is a national chain of coffee shops in the UK. A few years ago, they decided to empower all of their staff to &lsquo;make customers smile&rsquo; &ndash; they can essentially &lsquo;give&rsquo; a free drink to a customer if they think it is appropriate. This happened to me in their shop in Oxford Street. I happened to be the first customer into the shop at 06:30am &ndash; I was greeted by the happiest, smiliest man behind the counter I have ever seen that early in the morning! This man was so smiley, I could not help but smile back at him, which sparked a conversation. I did not do this to intentionally try to get a free coffee &ndash; it was just a coincidence that he decided to give me a drink &lsquo;on him&rsquo;. It may sound like an overreaction, but I was delighted!!</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"611\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pret-a-manger.png\" width=\"602\"/></p><p> The reason I am telling you this story is because I want to describe the effect that this one experience has had on me. I equated me being happy and smiley with the receipt of a complimentary drink. I am now a loyal Pret customer &ndash; not only am I loyal, but every time I visit a Pret shop, I do so with a big smile on my face. I do not smile out of expectation &ndash; I smile because you never know!! Me being a happy customer is far more likely for Pret to treat me in the same way &ndash; with that small chance I may also get a free drink!! It is very clever. The next time you visit a Pret, see how many customers are smiling when they order their drink!!!</p><p> Like all relationships, Customer Experience is a two-way thing &ndash; it is not just about the employee interacting with the customer &ndash; it is also about the customer interacting with the employee. Whilst it can never be guaranteed, a happy customer is far more likely to receive a better Customer Experience than one who is not. Even if the functional mechanics of your Customer Experience are not as you would like them to be, polite, smiling, happy staff will be in a position to maintain the relationship with a customer &ndash; and make a customer smile, even when something has gone wrong. So think about the things you can do to not just impress the importance of old-fashioned values on your employees, but to your customers as well &ndash; and make sure to say please and thank you every time you deal with another human!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-05 17:14:55.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-05 17:14:55.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_YFY4Kgv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-happy-customers-make-better-customer-experiences/\", \"post_id\": \"12267\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-05 17:14:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-05 17:14:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-happy-customers-make-better-customer-experiences\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12265\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5956\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Do-Happy-Customers-Make-Better-Customer-Experiences.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"806\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467824400,"author_id":200,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5720,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Pros and Cons of Long-Term Care Insurance and Hybrid Plans","link":"the-pros-and-cons-of-long-term-care-insurance-and-hybrid-plans","source_link":null,"content":"<p>The prospect of debilitating illness late in life is not a pleasant one, but it&rsquo;s wise to protect yourself and your family from the financial hardships that could result from it. A common way to prepare yourself is by purchasing some form of long-term care insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long-term care insurance works like this: You pay an annual premium, and if you need long-term care due to age or illness, the policy pays out a daily or monthly benefit. Some people look askance at these policies because, if they die without needing long-term care, they feel they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; the premiums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a way to counter that, so-called hybrid policies have become popular. These policies combine long-term care insurance with permanent life insurance policies such as universal life insurance (which, like whole life insurance, includes a savings-investment component that builds up over time).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the hybrid scenario, a policyholder would withdraw funds from the policy when they are needed for long-term care, and the insurance company pays for care when those funds run out. And if the policyholder dies without having needed expensive long-term care, the heirs receive a death benefit &mdash; therefore the premiums paid into the policy are not &ldquo;wasted.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Damon Gonzalez, a financial advisor and a member of NerdWallet&rsquo;s Ask an Advisor, about the pluses and minuses of long-term care insurance and hybrid plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the main advantages of a hybrid policy over a traditional long-term care plan?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I find that some clients can&rsquo;t get past the &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; nature of traditional long-term care insurance. It is emotionally difficult to buy an insurance policy that may cost $4,000 to $8,000 per year and will pay out nothing if you pass away in your sleep. I had a client pass away last year in his mid-80s. He paid about $3,250 per year in premiums for 19 years. That is more than $60,000 that he and his family didn&rsquo;t get to use for something else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is the nature of insurance, however &mdash; you pay money to protect yourself from a risk that you hope never happens. If you pay for 20 years on a term life insurance policy and walk away with nothing, you don&rsquo;t wish you had died during that period. Likewise, I never think that I wasted money on car insurance if I didn&rsquo;t get in a car accident that year. For some reason, though, many people think differently about long-term care insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid policies reduce people&rsquo;s fear of wasting premiums by offering two exit strategies. The first exit strategy is that after the surrender charge period (usually 10 years), you can get most of your premiums back if you decide to cancel the policy. The illustration you receive from the insurance company shows that you will not make a return on your cash if you cancel it, but it is comforting to know that you can at least get a do-over if you change your mind down the road and want to cancel the policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, there is a death benefit that is paid to your heirs when you die. Leaving an inheritance is really important to a lot of people. They like knowing that some of the money they paid in premiums to the hybrid policy will be given to their kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last major advantage is that the benefits are guaranteed. If you pay your premiums (usually for 10 years or less), you will have a contractually guaranteed death benefit, guaranteed cash value and a guaranteed amount of long-term care coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional long-term care insurance policies, on the other hand, do not have these guarantees. In fact, insurers can petition the state departments of insurance to raise your premiums, sometimes as much as 50% per year. Some retirees with limited assets can&rsquo;t afford these increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the main disadvantages?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Because hybrid policies do so many different things, they aren&rsquo;t the best at any one thing. I recently ran an illustration where a client would pay $150,000 in premiums and after Year 10 could only walk away with $120,000 if she decided to cancel the policy. That is better than nothing, but walking away costs you $30,000 plus the opportunity costs on what you could have made investing that $150,000. The death benefit for most of the years of this policy was also only a little more than the $150,000 of premiums she would pay in. Because the insurance company is offering so much long-term care insurance, it can&rsquo;t offer great growth on the cash value or a great death benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another disadvantage of hybrid policies is that the premiums are paid over shorter periods of time than traditional long-term care, which can make them unaffordable for some people. While many factors can influence the price, hybrid care for a 62-year-old woman might be about $8,000 per year for 10 years, as opposed to roughly half that for a traditional LTC premium that is payable for life (or until care is needed). Conservative investors may like the idea of taking $100,000 that is currently in a CD and leveraging that money to provide some life insurance and some long-term care coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, the premiums you pay for hybrid policies are not potentially tax-deductible, because hybrid policies are not considered tax-qualified policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How should consumers choose the right plan?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I recommend you get quotes on several different types of policies and get comfortable with the costs, benefits and disadvantages. It is hard to make a decision without seeing real numbers and comparing the different types of insurance. Some people don&rsquo;t have the assets to be able to fund a hybrid policy within 10 years, and that alone could push them toward traditional long-term care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your health could also play a role in your decision &mdash; the underwriting for hybrid policies is usually a little easier, so your health may push you toward a hybrid policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, many people cannot stand the thought of paying $30,000 or more in premiums and never receiving a dime back from the insurance company. If that sounds like you, you might be drawn toward a hybrid policy or, as an alternative, a permanent life insurance policy that has a critical-care rider, which is a free or low-cost rider that allows you to be paid most of your death benefit while you are still alive to cover long-term care costs.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-05 17:21:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-05 17:21:45.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_cr8qjqm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-pros-and-cons-of-long-term-care-insurance-and-hybrid-plans/\", \"post_id\": \"12269\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-05 17:21:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-05 17:21:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-pros-and-cons-of-long-term-care-insurance-and-hybrid-plans\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12268\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5957\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Long-Term-Care-Insurance-and-Hybrid-Plans.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1854\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":37305,"author_id":123,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5721,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Move Over Millennials, Women Are the Next Wealth Management Challenge","link":"move-over-millennials-women-are-the-next-wealth-management-challenge","source_link":null,"content":"<p> $41 trillion is the oft-quoted figure of expected wealth transfer from the baby boomers but the World Wealth Report (WWR) reminds us that it&rsquo;s not, despite what recent reports would have you believe, all about millennials as inheritors: &ldquo;The first level of wealth transfer is not intergenerational but rather between spouses, some of whom may have had little engagement with the firm previously.&rdquo;</p><p> Roughly 70% of the $41 trillion will ultimately end up in the hands of women according to a report by the Center for Talent Innovation (CTI) whilst 70% of women leave their adviser within a year of being widowed say reports. That figure will vary across adviser and client types but, many argue, the trend is up rather than down.</p><p>  The CTI also reminds us that &ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t merely control the purse: they are filling it.&rdquo; Boston Consulting Group (BCG) projects that women will control 75% of discretionary spending around the world by 2028.  </p><p> Thus private client advisers will increasingly need to recognise women as wealth creators and decision makers, not just spouses and inheritors.</p><h3> WHAT WOMEN WANT <br/>  </h3><p> It is of course spurious to suggest that women are an homogenous group and that once you crack some sort of code competitive advantage will follow, but there is an opportunity not only to get it right but also to avoid getting it very wrong. </p><p> In its 2010 report &ldquo;Levelling the playing field: upgrading the wealth management experience for women&rdquo;, BCG found that more than half of the women surveyed felt wealth managers could significantly improve how they served them.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> It also warned against superficial strategies and women labelled products.  For a salutary lesson on this try googling Ellen DeGeneres and the Bic For Her ballpoint pen and/or the Amazon reviews that accompany the product online.</p><p> What women want, BCG noted, is for &ldquo;their advisers to understand who they are and what they want&rdquo; which is, after all, what most professional advisers should be doing anyway?</p><h3> BETTER INSIGHT IS REQUIRED <br/>  </h3><p> Yes indeed, but not uniformly partly because professional services firms do not invest as much as other sectors in client insight often reasoning that the front office/fee earners know their clients and firms can aggregate that feedback.  Formalised feedback, journey mapping and others tricks of the client experience trade haven&rsquo;t made significant inroads into the private client world despite huge changes in recent years to demographics, attitudes and the customer referral journey caused by digitisation.</p><p> Relying on meaningful and usable insights trickling into the business from the front office adds to the risk that firms will rely on generalisations. A 2015 State Street report talked about the dangers of relying on &ldquo;conventional wisdom&rdquo; and &ldquo;misperception&rdquo; concluding that the &ldquo;the danger of this myth is that it may actually be self-perpetuating and have a detrimental effect on advisors&rsquo; efforts to establish better relationships with this growing client segment.&rdquo;</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> GENDER SMARTS <br/>  </h3><p> A report by ING Direct in Australia last year suggested it was &ldquo;critical for women of all ages, particularly mature women, to be involved in new product research and development because financial products have historically been developed and distributed through a predominately male lens&rdquo;  and theCTI talks about the importance of &ldquo;gender smarts&rdquo;.</p><p> Such gender smarts is challenging in firms where senior management teams lack diversity.  Women remain in a minority at senior levels in financial and professional services firms on the whole and as Oliver Wyman&rsquo;s 2014 &ldquo;Women in financial services&rdquo; report highlighted, this can lead to unconscious biases and assumptions arising. </p><p> Measures to improve awareness of internal gender issues are becoming more common - see EY&rsquo;s reverse mentoring featured in The Times in April for example.  For client-facing staff, soft skills training and even empathy training is a route some firms have taken.</p><p> These are all good skills regardless of gender and other diversity dimensions  &ndash; leading to better disclosure, higher trust levels and greater client engagement which in turn improves outcomes and client advocacy rates which is good for everyone&rsquo;s business.</p><h3> WATCH OUT THE ROBOS ARE COMING <br/>  </h3><p> ING Direct&rsquo;s report suggested that &ldquo;Technology will play a critical role in building and delivering solutions which appeal to women and provide simplicity, transparency and value for money.&rdquo; In wealth female-orientated &ldquo;robo-advisers&rdquo; are emerging (eg WorthFM and Ellevest) and while established firms or the wider private client industry may not be quaking in their boots just yet, nor is the risk peculiar to female clients, digitally-enabled &ldquo;disruptors&rdquo; can more readily adjust their propositions and client experience for commercially attractive &ldquo;niches&rdquo;.</p><p> Thus even firms that don&rsquo;t perceive gender as an issue, who feel that their service is bespoke so client needs and wants are automatically catered for, might consider testing that assumption with female clients sooner rather than later.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-05 17:28:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-05 17:28:32.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_Fgxjthe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/move-over-millennials-women-are-the-next-wealth-management-challenge/\", \"post_id\": \"12271\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-05 17:28:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-05 17:28:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"move-over-millennials-women-are-the-next-wealth-management-challenge\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12270\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5958\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Move-Over-Millennials-Women-Are-the-Next-Wealth-Management-Challenge.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1248\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467802800,"author_id":167,"chart_url":""}

Not exactly the oration it sounded like in your head, is it?</p><p> You&rsquo;re great at telling your mom or your bestie about yourself but during a job interview it just doesn&rsquo;t sound as influential, does it? Little bit of stuttering here &amp; there? Drawing a blank? Too many &ldquo;um&rdquo;s?</p><p> We&rsquo;ve established that there&rsquo;s a difference between how persuasive you are during comfortable situations vs the ones where something can actually come of it. We&rsquo;ve established that 1. you&rsquo;re not alone &amp; 2. there are good reasons for this.</p><p> But now let&rsquo;s do something about it! These are not things you have to live with! Let&rsquo;s get you super cool &amp; persuasive when you need it most.</p><h3> Persuasive Communicators are Relaxed <br/>  </h3><p> Find out what relaxes you &amp; make sure you&rsquo;re doing these things regularly. For me it&rsquo;s going for a walk, listening to music, going for a walk while listening to music, gardening &amp; doing my relaxation exercises. The ones that keep me habitually relaxed before &amp; during every communicative situation.</p><h3> Make a List &amp; Prepare Your Message <br/>  </h3><p> Make a list of the areas you want to be more persuasive &amp; get more out of life. Is it when you meet new people? At meetings when you spew your genius? Dating? Interviews? Giving a speech? Your elevator pitch?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Record yourself saying what you might say during those times &amp; relentlessly assess yourself. Don&rsquo;t be in denial like the folks on Kitchen Nightmares. You&rsquo;re not perfect at communicating in anxiety-ridden situations - none of us are. So figure out precisely what you&rsquo;re doing wrong &amp; fix it. Practice doesn&rsquo;t make perfect unless it&rsquo;s paired with self-assessment &amp; improvement.</p><h3> Add Pauses &amp; Linking to Your Newly Designed Message <br/>  </h3><p> You may not have to slow down your rate of speech as much as you think. Timing and pauses help your listener be in the present with you. Remember, when you&rsquo;re speaking you&rsquo;re usually thinking of the next thing you&rsquo;re going to say. Your listener is still processing the last thing you said. Input your pauses correctly &amp; you&rsquo;ll both be in the present. There&rsquo;s something magical about that.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Practice <br/>  </h3><p> Try it a few times on your own with the recorder. Then try to record your side of a real conversation with others while you&rsquo;re telling your stories. Of course, relentlessly assess!</p><p> Be hard on yourself, because your message matters. Learning to be persuasive is not about manipulating people; far from it. You can only be truly persuasive when you believe in your message, but that tends to be when your nerves are at their worst. So keep your purpose in mind when you&rsquo;re struggling to listen to yourself on recording to help you push through the awkwardness (I know, we all sound so weird to ourselves when recorded).</p><h3> Measure Your Success <br/>  </h3><p> Look for incremental improvements. You&rsquo;re not going to go from 0-100 right off the bat. (Trying to convince my 7-year-old of that!) Measure in increments of 10% each time you tell your story. When I say relentlessly assess do it objectively like a scientist. Assess your errors but just as importantly look at what you&rsquo;re doing right and watch it continually improve with each story you tell.</p><p> Just like any other goal you must define it and set up a step-by-step process to get there. Measure your success along the way &amp; in a matter of weeks you&rsquo;ll be getting what you need out of life in the most rewarding areas of your life.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-05 17:31:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-05 17:31:50.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_yVYRjbd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-super-cool-and-persuasive-when-you-need-it-most/\", \"post_id\": \"12273\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-05 17:31:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-05 17:31:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-super-cool-and-persuasive-when-you-need-it-most\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12272\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5959\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/How-to-Get-Super-Cool-and-Persuasive-When-You-Need-It-Most.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"981\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467817200,"author_id":202,"chart_url":""}

As a result, my brother and I had to taste every type of food, visit art museums, learn to garden and make jam&ndash;all while trying to understand the delicate dance of communication. We played at being city folk and country folk, all with the idea that  <strong>  variety leads to curiosity, and from curiosity the world will be seen in technicolor! </strong></p><p> Often on the way to church, my mom would take back roads and alternate unknown routes, all in the name of curiosity and adventure. My brother and I thought she was nuts! But in hindsight, which is always 20/20, she was darn smart.</p><p> If something seemed yucky or looked disgusting, in other words, we didn&rsquo;t want to eat it, touch it, do it or smell it, she put it front and center so we could try something new. She wanted us to master life, and in her opinion, that meant planting seeds of curiosity so we would always explore alternatives before closing a door to an opportunity.</p><p> I could only claim I didn&rsquo;t like something after I tried it. Mom thought it was wonderful if I wanted to visit another church, synagogue or temple, and the idea that my curiosity to learn about others was bubbling and would allow me to access the connection to myself on a deeper level. What became interesting to me was that my mother never felt threatened by my expanding interests, in fact, she was excited about them.</p><p> No conflict about ending up too far to the left or too far to the right, as curiosity is the mysterious ingredient that makes everything as it should be. If you experience everything life has to offer, you&rsquo;ll have a life filled with magical and mysterious experiences. And imagine those experiences interwoven with wonderful people who share their journeys with you.</p><p> What my brother and I didn&rsquo;t realize, after all, how could we, was that we were given a gentle guide and the positive preparation for life. Dive into something scary, chances are it won&rsquo;t be that bad. Be curious enough to try something new on a menu. Participate in an activity you know absolutely nothing about as you buckle up for a wonderful ride because curiosity opens the door to exploration, which in turn provides information and that, gives the gift of inspiration!</p><p> So did curiosity kill the cat? No, it did not!

{"original_id":5724,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Authentic Leadership Sounds Nice … but Doesn't Mean Anything Until You Define It","link":"authentic-leadership-sounds-nice-but-doesnt-mean-anything-until-you-define-it","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> One of the biggest challenges I have as an executive coach is working with people who simply take complex issues at face value.  We are moving so quickly in our daily lives that we don&rsquo;t take the time to pause and delve deeper into something to truly understand issues, garner effective meaning and compose our proper reaction.</h3>A perfect example of this is authenticity. You can&rsquo;t open any business publication or website today that isn&rsquo;t talking about &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; as a core aspect of leadership. It&rsquo;s a buzzword of the tallest order, and like most other buzzwords or items enjoying popularity &ndash; everyone is suddenly an expert and, much too often, advice on them is misguided. Competencies like authenticity aren&rsquo;t born of advice-laden articles; they are highly personal and specific, worked on, developed and incorporated by individuals as their own over time. Development of these competencies isn&rsquo;t as easy as reading an article &ndash; but what worth doing really is?<h3> <strong>  Authenticity, when it comes to leadership, isn&rsquo;t defined by you. </strong></h3>Knowing your values and keeping your compass pointing north is essential to being a leader &ndash; there is no denying that. It&rsquo;s what drives good decision making, and it helps leaders sleep at night. However, the very definition of being a leader requires other people to rally behind you. Just as important as finding the values important to you is how other people see those values asthey relate to you.Henri Rousseau, the French painter, once said &ldquo;inauthenticity is defined by external forces.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not enough to state &ldquo;these are my ideals, these are my values, and what I do is authentic to them.&rdquo; This is the<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> great paradox of authentic leadership</a>. Your external forces &ndash; your audience, followers, etc. - need to believe you. And doing anything unnatural, even simple gestures or language, will cloud your message. You could be stating unequivocal truths and responding in ways true to your ideals, but if people don&rsquo;t believe you, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter.##TRENDING##<h3> <strong>  What is authentic actually changes </strong></h3>Authenticity is dynamic &ndash; which means it changes from person to person. And whether you are viewed as an authentic individual changes with each conversation you have. You can say the exact same thing to two different people and they will walk away with different impressions due to context, history, and basic attitudes of the day.One of the issues that many leaders face is the need to be everything to everyone. In order to do that, an individual leader needs to align their values with the most effective way to communicate to their separate followers and audiences.In 2008, when the economy was collapsing, I worked with many executives who had to align their messaging for three audiences &ndash; clients, shareholders and employees. It was the same message, however slightly tailored to different groups. Those executives that could adjust to each audience were successful. Those that could not became, in essence, victims of a down economy.<h3> <strong>  What we think of as our &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; self is actually our &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; self </strong></h3>In general &ndash; our perception of ourselves is wrong. We may think we are the best dancer on the floor, but Seinfeld&rsquo;s Elaine would disagree. When we think of what it means to be our &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; self, we are actually imagining what our &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; self is. Our perception of ourselves gives extra weight to our &ldquo;intentions,&rdquo; not just our actions. And our intentions have zero weighting on how we are perceived by others.Authenticity is an important component to leadership. We know this. However, the attributes related to authenticity, and its definition, is going to be different for each leader. There are steps needed to define what is authentic for you, as perceived by your audience. This takes work. First, you need to find out the values intrinsic to you (honestly). Second, you need to compare this to how other people view you.<a href=\"/grow/development/the-feedback-you-need-but-dont-get-and-secretly-dont-want\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> This takes feedback</a>.

You&rsquo;ve got to have a plan. Retiring and leaving work, it&rsquo;s as inevitable as death and paying taxes.</h3><p> <br/> But even when carefully planned, the reality of leaving company leadership quite often is not that easy. That leadership role and your success in business has become your identity. It&rsquo;s hard to give that up. That is why it&rsquo;s very important to think about how you are going to feel at retirement and what you are going to do with the rest of your life. It is wise to do this much sooner than you might think.</p><h3> <strong>  The Planning Process </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your financial wellbeing is of course your first priority. Your CPA, your financial advisor and a good tax attorney must be amongst your trusted advisers. Then you can turn your attention to other factors.</p><p> Have you thought about the psychological impact retirement might have. How will you feel not going to the office every morning? Here again planning becomes a factor. What will you do with that time? Will your focus be on travel, hobbies, volunteer work, or perhaps starting a new venture?</p><p> For some the right answer may be providing support to other companies by serving on boards. You continue to use your expertise and you&rsquo;ve created another income stream to enhance retirement. Keep in mind those board commitments may be time-consuming. You will want to get a buy-in from family members who may have other ideas about how you should spend retirement years.</p><p> Whatever you decide, make certain you find something you enjoy. The happiest retirees most often are the men and women who continue making positive contributions to their community and the world.</p><h3> <strong>  The Retirement Process </strong></h3><p> <br/> Make your retirement plans known at work in stages. Early on, perhaps six months in advance, let management know of your plans and desired date of departure. You will want to share the decision with your own staff and closest colleagues before news of your planned retirement hits the grapevine. Send personal notes to important colleagues and clients.</p><p> Once a search committee is established to find your successor, be helpful. Perhaps the committee would welcome your ideas about critical job responsibilities and the skills needed by the ideal candidate. Be a consultant, but do not become actively involved in the search. Should the committee&rsquo;s ultimate selection not succeed, you do not want your fingerprints on the project.</p><p> Finally, do not burn bridges. Perhaps a useful and lucrative second act will be that of a consultant for the company you are leaving.</p><h3> <strong>  Making the Transition Work </strong></h3><p> <br/> Actively work to make the transition to your successor successful. Begin knowledge sharing. Make introductions to key people in your organization as well as to important clients. Do everything possible to make certain the new executive has the background and the recommendations needed to understand the climate and the culture of the organization. Realize that all of your recommendations may not be accepted, but be confident that you&rsquo;ve done all in your power to make the transition work.</p><p> Finally, here&rsquo;s a reminder. Don&rsquo;t put off building a business plan for yourself in Life 2.0. For some executives one of the hardest parts of retiring is reinventing oneself, deciding what to do next.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-06 14:15:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-06 14:15:32.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_sDsR9Mo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-are-the-options-for-the-retiring-executive/\", \"post_id\": \"12278\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-06 14:15:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-06 14:15:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-are-the-options-for-the-retiring-executive\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12277\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5962\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-Are-the-Options-for-The-Retiring-Executive_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"569\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467889200,"author_id":464,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5726,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Steps To Greater Financial Intimacy","link":"7-steps-to-greater-financial-intimacy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> ﻿ &ldquo;&lsquo;Not all relationships require financial intimacy to function, but financial intimacy does require a deep connectedness to exist.&rdquo; (Timmons).</p><p> Money is a complicated topic. Its also a main contributor to divorce. So, the early and more often couples discuss this very dicey topic, the better. Discussions around money can quickly spiral out of control and become circular arguments with no end in sight. How couples navigate this conversation is as much to do with how they were each raised around money and how they are currently living their lives. The chances or likelihood that you will end up with someone whose family experiences with money are very similar to yours is slim to none. Yet, it is important to remember that these experiences help shape a person&rsquo;s ideas about how they perceive the role of money in their life and the degree to which you are &ndash; or are not - financially astute and responsible (Timmons).</p><p> So, it should come as no surprise that most couples would rather ignore the subject and pretend that money issues don&rsquo;t need to be addressed (or have teeth extracted!) - and think if we &ldquo;tap our red shoes three times, the problems will magically disappear&rdquo; (they won&rsquo;t.). The only guarantee that comes with ignoring financial problems is that they will grow in size and become bigger problems - both in the short and long term. Some couples believe &ndash; erroneously &ndash; that talking about them only creates a larger vacuum of problems, circular conversations, and the &ldquo;road that leads to nowhere&rdquo; &ndash; fast. But, that&rsquo;s the opposite of what really happens.</p><p> Yet, despite couples hesitant to disclose, there are ways to build greater financial intimacy even if in the moment it doesn't feel that way. Taking the steps, even the small ones in the beginning, will over time, encourage greater intimacy, promote a unified relationship, and create hope for the future - together. However having these conversations is easier said than done - at least in the beginning. In theory, it might work fine, but in actual practice it feels painful, like you are crawling out of your skin. But, despite the obstacles, with the right ingredients - effort, intention, willingness, support, safety, commitment, time, and the mindset by both parties that talking about their financial relationship is vital to keeping their relationship healthy &ndash; success is possible. Both partners must agree to be on board and make an investment in both their present and their financial future. This investment is fueled by their commitment as a couple and a belief that having these difficult and uncomfortable conversations will, over time, strengthen their relationship and resolve.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 7 Steps To Greater Financial Intimacy.</h3><h3> <br/> 1.)  <strong>  Embrace the calm time </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> Use this time to your advantage. When things are calm and there isn&rsquo;t relationship strife, have an open discussion about the messages you received from your parents about money growing up.  This helps each person understand themselves better and their partner. It also provides a frame of reference when challenging times occur or there is a difference in opinion. From that, you will more than likely have greater acceptance of each other&rsquo;s viewpoints.</p><h3> 2.)  <strong>  Have a consistent financial date night </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> This helps keep the couple on task, assign money-related tasks, and discuss both short-term and long-term financial decisions. It also allows the couple to see their progress &ndash; or lack thereof &ndash; toward their financial goals (Powell).</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 3.)  <strong>  Acknowledge the business side of marriage </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> Before you say, &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; couples need to have an open and frank conversation about income, debt, and spending. Despite it being a difficult goal, it really is mandatory. This will affect the marriage as a whole in many ways, both expected and unexpected. Having this conversation allows for better preparation for your future together. (Kerns).</p><h3> 4.)  <strong>  Build a Unified Vision of Your Financial Future. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> People in general do better when they have short and long term goals. It keeps us on task, moving toward something. Goals provide purpose and something to look forward to; whether the goal is financial, leisure, education, or recreational &ndash; it&rsquo;s all the same. Having goals together as a couple is no different. Couples do their best work when they have shared goals, dreams, and a vision. Establishing a unified vision of your financial future is opens up the opportunity to talk about your values are, where you are, where you want to be, and how, as a couple, you will get there. </p><h3> <strong>  5.) Goal setting </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> Put your goals in writing. This makes it more tangible. It also promotes the accountability factor (which we all need from time to time!) We can all have lofty goals and dreams and talk about what we would like, but putting our goals on paper makes it that much more real. This can be part of your financial date night; if not, decide how often you will review your goals. Having a written version help this process. You can check your progress and see what is and isn&rsquo;t working. This allows the couple to reassess and make any necessary changes. Choose your goal, state it simply and refer to it regularly. Talk about it. Often. This provides the clarity that couples need to make sure they are still both on the same page. </p><p> And because a lot of arguments come from a disparity in goals, writing down both individual and couple goals will strengthen the financial intimacy with the couple. For example, perhaps one individual is a saver and the other is a spender.</p><h3> 6.)  <strong>  Be Non-Judgmental </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;To be successful, initiate the conversation from a place of acceptance and non-judgment.&rdquo; Take responsibility for your own role in the situation &mdash; did you avoid looking at the bills, for example &mdash; and admit to your own mistakes. It&rsquo;s never a bad idea to say, &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; in a conversation like this. </p><h3> 7.)  <strong>  Create Transparency. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> Despite the progress we have made as a society, we lag in equal amounts in terms of attitudes and actions with money and transparency. Yet, transparency is vital to both the growth and stability of the partnership. Its value and importance holds true regardless of whether the couple keeps their money separate or combines them. </p><p> As time moves on, couple find that in order to grow and change with the times, they will need to continue to reevaluate their situation. But having a strong foundation from which to build from, will start them off in a healthy direction!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-06 14:24:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-06 14:24:29.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_DgB4gzR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-steps-to-greater-financial-intimacy/\", \"post_id\": \"12280\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-06 14:24:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-06 14:24:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-steps-to-greater-financial-intimacy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12279\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5963\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/7-Steps-To-Greater-Financial-Intimacy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"839\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467885600,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5727,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Financial Industry's Seismic Transformation Will Continue","link":"the-financial-industrys-seismic-transformation-will-continue","source_link":null,"content":"<p> While I was setting up office space for my new marketing firm, Sondhelm Partners, I had the opportunity to go through boxes of material from the many investment companies with whom I have worked over the past 20 years as a marketing strategist. This trip down memory lane made me stop and consider how technology, the popularity of defined contribution plans, increased competition from ETFs, and index funds and the decentralization of the intermediary market have transformed the way fund companies market and sell their products to investors and advisors.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a stretch to say that the industry has undergone more seismic changes since I joined it in 1995 than in the previous 50 years before it.</p><h3> TAX INVESTING SHIFT <br/>  </h3><p> When I started, most people bought mutual funds as taxable investments, But as the decade progressed, IRAs and DC plans became the primary vehicles for mutual fund investing. In 1994, 22% of all DC assets were held in mutual funds; by 2014 that percentage had increased to 55%, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. With these plans effectively removing lower-net-worth investors from the direct-sold market, advisors have become the primary resource wealthier investors turn to for recommendations of individual mutual funds.</p><h3> INTERNET&rsquo;S RISE <br/>  </h3><p> The internet has enabled anyone to instantly execute investment decisions without the need of intermediaries. Of course, this empowerment also allows them to make costly mistakes, which has helped many advisors remain in business as &ldquo;damage control&rdquo; specialists.</p><h3> COST IS KEY  <br/>  </h3><p> Growing dissatisfaction with the lackluster performance of actively managed funds, the increasing popularity of index funds and the transition of many advisors from commission-based to fee-based compensation models have compelled many active fund managers to lower fund expenses and launch their own index fund options.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> ETF EXPLOSION  <br/>  </h3><p> ETFs have emerged as the most serious competitive threat to mutual funds. While the net growth in the number of mutual funds has been modest since the start of the 21st century, the ETF market has exploded, growing from 198 options in 2003 to nearly 2,000 at the end of 2014, according to ICI.</p><h3> GATEKEEEPERS  <br/>  </h3><p> In the 1990s, wirehouse reps were the primary intermediary target audience for fund companies. Today, fund companies must tailor their sales and marketing approaches to gain consideration among a wide variety of gatekeepers, including CIOs at RIA firms, independent broker/dealers, DC record keepers and TAMPs.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> WHOLESALER CHALLENGES  <br/>  </h3><p> With advisors able to conduct most fund-related research online, wholesalers can no longer get away with the traditional &ldquo;product pitchbook&rdquo; meetings of the past. The shrinking number of advisors who still meet with wholesalers expect them to serve as proxies for portfolio managers, delivering detailed attribution of fund performance and market insights.</p><h3> FUND &lsquo;AMBASSADORS&rsquo;  <br/>  </h3><p> With the rising cost of distribution, nearly all but the most successful fund managers have had to increase the amount of time they spend discussing their strategies and results with advisors &mdash; and sometimes investors. Firms also leverage digital engagement strategies to build awareness and visibility for their people and products.</p><h3> BRAND-BASED ADs <br/>  </h3><p> Until the past decade or so, print advertising dominated fund companies&rsquo; marketing budgets. Ads promoted products and performance, and only print could provide the space for lengthy legal and compliance disclosures. In recent years, most of the large fund companies have added TV commercials to their advertising mix, bypassing the disclosure issue by focusing on brand awareness, rather than performance.</p><h3> THE FUTURE  <br/>  </h3><p> Now that I&rsquo;ve discussed how the industry has changed, I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and make a few predictions on how the industry will change by 2025 &mdash;the year I reach my three decade anniversary.</p><p> Consolidation among actively managed fund companies: Funds and fund companies that fail to attract investors will close or merge.</p><p> The demise of advisor-share classes: The failure of most actively managed funds to consistently outperform their benchmarks will make it increasingly difficult for broker/dealers to justify these funds&rsquo; sales loads and 12b-1 fees. And thousands of registered reps will become investment advisers.</p><p> Greater specialization: Advisors seeking to differentiate their practices will turn to niche and boutique firms for specialized investment strategies that cut across asset classes and styles, much like smart beta and target date funds do today.</p><p> Whether any of these predictions come true, or not, there&rsquo;s one thing about this industry I can say with complete confidence: Expect change.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-06 15:59:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-06 15:59:38.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_SxRVasl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-financial-industrys-seismic-transformation-will-continue/\", \"post_id\": \"12282\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-06 15:59:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-06 15:59:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-financial-industrys-seismic-transformation-will-continue\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12281\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5964\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Financial-Industry\\u2019s-Seismic-Transformation-Will-Continue.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"693\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467882000,"author_id":124,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5728,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why We Fail to Read Business Books (and How to Become a Lean Mean Reading Machine)","link":"why-we-fail-to-read-business-books-and-how-to-become-a-lean-mean-reading-machine","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Admit it.</p><p> You have several half-read books stacked up on your nightstand, several more squirreled away in a desk drawer and a dozen more on your Amazon wish list.</p><p> You scrutinize all the books that &ldquo;customers also bought&rdquo; looking for those one-of-a-kind books that will transform you into a smarter person. You jump &ldquo;inside the book&rdquo; to read the table of contents and credits and page through the free preview.</p><p> Searching for the magic formula.</p><p> The formula that will erase the silent self-doubt. The nagging thought that you can do better.</p><p> Books have an uncanny power to teach us, to transport us, to move us light years beyond our ordinary lives. If we could only find the right books, the tried-and-true books written by trusted masters. So we keep looking.</p><p> And once in a while you find a book that speaks to your heart and gets to the core of what you&rsquo;re struggling with right now. It changes you. It changes your skills. It changes your life.</p><p> Because fulfilling your potential depends upon your continuing education as a financial planner. It means you regularly upgrade and fine-tune your skills.</p><h3> The Problem Everyone Immediately Understands <br/>  </h3><p> When you hear people say you should read business books, you think, &ldquo;Yeah, I should!&rdquo; Then a little voice in your head whisperes something like, &ldquo;Why should I buy books if I don&rsquo;t have time to read?&rdquo;</p><p> That is the key, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> Time.</p><p> Having the time to read all the amazing books and apply the lessons that will rocket your knowledge, skills and financial planning service into the heavens.</p><p> And having time to find prospective clients. And time to manage portfolios. And time to network. And deal with compliance. And time for your kids.</p><p> And when you do invest your precious time, you&rsquo;re fundamentally the same. You&rsquo;re full of excitement and plans. You&rsquo;re bursting with potential and ideas.</p><p> And zero action.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why all the standard advice about reading books is confusing. Books don&rsquo;t make you a smarter person. Time does.</p><p> Because it&rsquo;s how much time you can spend studying the best books about business, sales, and your niche; implementing all the great stuff you learned that determines how fast your planning service, or you as a person, will grow. </p><p> Books are essential, but time is the magic elixir.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> What &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Have Enough Time&rdquo; Really Means <br/>  </h3><p> Most people experience this feeling of scarcity when it comes to time.</p><p> We all have a long list of things we&rsquo;d love to read if only there were space in our busy days.</p><li> How to engage with people</li><li> The psychology of persuasion</li><li> How to build trust and credibility</li><p> But those skills almost never get to bask in the light of our undivided attention.</p><p> Equally, most of us would admit that we do not spend every hour of our time wisely. We&rsquo;d grudgingly concede that less time on social media or one less series watched on Netflix, would free up valuable hours each week.</p><p> So what&rsquo;s going on here? Is our time scarce or not?</p><p> In reality, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have enough time&rdquo; is often just the label we give something else:</p><p> Uncertainty.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re uncertain whether reading that business book will be time well spent, that uncertainty manifests itself as a lack of time.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s try a quick thought experiment.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Imagine you were suddenly somehow 100% sure that two hours a day spent on reading business books would lead to wild success.</p><p> Would you struggle to find those extra hours?</p><p> I seriously doubt it. Chances are, your calendar would miraculously open up, like the Red Sea parting for Moses&rsquo; staff.</p><p> But instead you pause and wonder:</p><li> Is this the right business book?</li><li> Does it really solve my problem?</li><li> Is this worth my precious time?</li><p> And these are all valid questions.</p><p> But here&rsquo;s the bad news:</p><h3> Amazon isn&rsquo;t going to solve this problem <br/>  </h3><p> Knowing the result of a book before you buy it is an appealing notion.</p><p> The reason the next book on your Amazon wish list is so alluring, is that you&rsquo;re expecting a result:</p><li> The proven strategy to attract customers</li><li> The shortcut to double your revenue</li><li> The secret formula to let people say YES to your offer</li><p> Unfortunately, few books come with a guaranteed result.</p><p> For example, if you&rsquo;ve read Influence from Robert Cialdini (one of the best books out there), you probably know the science about how to persuade people.</p><p> However, you&rsquo;d still experience some degree of uncertainty.</p><p> You&rsquo;d pause before acting and think:</p><li> Are these truly the correct steps?</li><li> Even if they work for others, will they work for me?</li><li> Am I really capable of executing them?</li><p> In the real world, certainty is rarely a reasonable expectation.</p><p> That said, most people could benefit from a little more clarity.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m introducing the Right Brain Book Academy.</p><p> Right Brain Book Academy is where Amazon and real life come together in one platform. It&rsquo;s about making business psychology actionable, without bothering you with the science that goes with it.</p><p> And you might wonder: Is Right Brain Book Academy something for me?</p><p> Well, it depends, because readers span a wide spectrum. However, they do fall into three distinct groups:</p><h3> The Entrepreneur Reader <br/>  </h3><p> You look at reading differently to other financial planners.</p><p> You&rsquo;re not just reading; you&rsquo;re implementing and testing the ideas you&rsquo;re learning. Reading is improving your service and your business, but it&rsquo;s not an end in itself.</p><p> Because you&rsquo;re doing this more or less continuously, you have significantly more time to spend experimenting with the ideas you learn that others can&rsquo;t.</p><p> Because you believe it improves your financial planning service. You&rsquo;re willing to invest time and money in it, so the time investment doesn&rsquo;t put you off &ndash; IF the books make sense for &lsquo;learning the right stuff&rsquo; and &ndash; in the end &ndash; will grow your business and personal life.</p><p> Are you an Entrepreneur Reader? Right Brain Book Academy isn&rsquo;t for you.</p><h3> The Committed Reader <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;ve gotten your feet wet in reading,  and you&rsquo;re committed to read more.</p><p> You want to implement the ideas you learn, but there&rsquo;s always &lsquo;something more important&rsquo; to do. You&rsquo;re squeezing out as much time as you can, maybe 5 to 10 hours every week, and you need the right books that won&rsquo;t suck up much time but will deliver a big impact.</p><h3> The Minimalist Reader <br/>  </h3><p> You think about reading once in a while, but you may not be too sure about the benefits. You&rsquo;re willing to dip your toe in the water, because it seems like it could work for you. But time is still a challenge. You just don&rsquo;t have the hours.</p><p> Most of all, you don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time on it, or you don&rsquo;t have a lot of extra time in your life right now. Whether your book-interest is a passion, a hobby or related to our beautiful profession, reading sometimes feels like a burden that you can give no more than 5 hours per week, if that.</p><h3> Reject Randomness and Create a Simple Reading Strategy <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s time to admit it.</p><p> You invest too much energy in your education to accept minimal results.</p><p> But the truth is, reading-randomness is killing your precious time (and chances for success).</p><p> Without a coherent strategy for turning your time into results, you&rsquo;ll burn out before reaching your destination.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to create a complicated plan&mdash;you just need to work out what books will move you and your service from one stage to the next.</p><p> So, give yourself a simple strategy and start getting real results.</p><p> Your service deserves it.</p><p> Your clients deserve it.</p><p> And you sure as heck deserve it too.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s make financial planning matter!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-06 16:04:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-06 16:04:02.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_9pcoN1n.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-we-fail-to-read-business-books-and-how-to-become-a-lean-mean-reading-machine/\", \"post_id\": \"12284\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-06 16:04:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-06 16:04:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-we-fail-to-read-business-books-and-how-to-become-a-lean-mean-reading-machine\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12283\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5965\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Why-We-Fail-to-Read-Business-Books-and-How-to-Become-a-Lean-Mean-Reading-Machine.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"756\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467900000,"author_id":409,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5729,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Impact Investing: How to Find Impact on the Efficient Frontier","link":"impact-investing-how-to-find-impact-on-the-efficient-frontier","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Let me explain the title first, starting with a general historical definition of the words: &ldquo;Impact on the Efficient Frontier,&rdquo; to specific current usage: I mean the current buzzwords for all kinds of purposeful money practices, which boil down to: &ldquo;impact investing.&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Originally impact (impingere) was the measure of a hit, but when technology (think steam engines and smokestacks over sweatshops) was seriously impinging on human life it took on a more philosophical meaning: the deeper affect, the impact on the human soul; and later as humanity woke up more: the impact on the environment (e.g. the measurable carbon footprint).</p><p> What about the word &ldquo;efficient?&rdquo; The Latin verb &ldquo;efficere&rdquo; just seems to have meant getting something done period. As consciousness advanced we added a judgment on the deed: measuring the least time, money, and/or resources wasted in the doing.</p><p> We think of the &ldquo;frontier&rdquo; as the wild border or no man&rsquo;s land between two countries. But oddly enough, in terms of financial models it is not the most dangerous place to be but the most efficient! It defines the border between too little risk to accomplish (efficient) your financial goals, and more risk than you need to take to get the job done.</p><p> The question I am posing is this: can an investor invest efficiently (on that efficient frontier) while considering the effect of the investments? Or, put another way: is there a neutral to positive correlation between the human and environmental impact of an investment and the financial risk/return?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The answer would be yes if the manager/investor manages all the other factors well. The answer will be a resounding YES! when investors wake up and recognize that companies who waste resources, degrade the environment and exploit humanity are unlikely to be as successful with customers in the long run ( a good place to see how companies compare is www.csrhub.com).</p><p> Economists standing behind Milton Friedman and the former Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, would have been stacked strongly on the No side. But this is changing (see http://evonomics.com/milton-friedman-doctrine-wrong-heres-rethink-corporation/ ) as regular people recognize that companies cannot forget about their impact on society and the environment without paying a price, and economists are noticing that short-term focused incentives are not good for anyone but the 1%.</p><p> The knee jerk reaction to this is to get mad and call for an end to shareholder capitalism: capitalism that favors the shareholders above all other stakeholders. This is understandable, but I would like to propose a both/and solution, a hybrid that maintains the interests of investors alongside the other stakeholders (employees, community, environment, customers etc.). After all, happy employees and consumers should result in successful businesses. It sounds so old-fashioned but it is true. We just lost sight of it because of the na&iuml;ve conviction that the leaders of big corporations knew how to run businesses.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Now, Slow Money and Patient Capital are important concepts in the Impact World, implying that trading is for greedy guts, who don&rsquo;t get it, and we should rather own what is good long term and stick with it. My perspective is exactly the same in terms of private investments that need long term care.</p><p> However, for public markets there needs to be a different way to put this long term philosophy into practice. In public markets our goal is simply to support the true value of firms that are benefiting society and the environment. Our long term approach is to maintain a universe of positive companies on our research site ( <a href=\"http://www.wikipositive.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://www.wikipositive.org </a> ) and continually monitor their prices. If any of them lose value in an unwarranted way we want to own them and support their reversion to a proper price. Similarly if they are suddenly overvalued we expect a reversion and want to benefit our investors by taking some profits. They remain on our watch-list long term but our job is to lead the positive impact market by continually shepherding each position toward a price that is true.</p><p> By comparing the aggregated ratings on CSRHub with stock performance, we believe a pattern will emerge where the highest Environmental/Social/Governance ratings will show superior risk/return profiles. This is supported by data from Trust Across America and HIP investor ratings. Positive impact is already showing itself to be a factor in finding the &ldquo;efficient frontier.&rdquo;</p><p> When I decided to leave the big banks and develop solutions for impact investors in 2007, I had clear goals in the front of my mind: How can we use smart tools learned from traditional investing but applied now to a new universe of impact investments? Can we create a combination of investments that works as an efficient frontier: getting the desired performance efficiently without too much risk and with the highest possible standards for desired impact on society and the environment. The more investors and companies wake up to the unsustainable nature of the current shareholder capitalism that plays recklessly with our future, the easier it will become for impact managers to succeed at finding impact on the efficient frontier.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-06 16:06:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-06 16:06:26.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_ez7mlfM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/impact-investing-how-to-find-impact-on-the-efficient-frontier/\", \"post_id\": \"12286\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-06 16:06:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-06 16:06:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"impact-investing-how-to-find-impact-on-the-efficient-frontier\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12285\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5966\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Differentiation-Why-Visible-Expertise-is-So-Impactful-for-Advisory-Firms.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"714\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467885600,"author_id":181,"chart_url":""}

Some of your clients are more easily &ldquo;dragged down&rdquo; by this negativity and actually start believing it! Others can look at a headline or &ldquo;sound byte&rdquo;, not read much of the article but come to their own inaccurate conclusion.</p><p> Now imagine a couple arriving together for their first annual review with you. The one is extremely concerned that the markets are fluctuating a lot. And, since it is so close to retirement he worries that if you continue with the portfolio you have designed it will mean major cutbacks in lifestyle spending. The other feels comfortable with the portfolio but she is concerned about your fee structure given all the recent press on advisors charging too much and damaging returns on retirement plans.</p><p> Of course, prior to your meeting, you don&rsquo;t know any of this is happening with your clients.

{"original_id":5731,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Differentiation: Why Visible Expertise is So Impactful for Advisory Firms","link":"differentiation-why-visible-expertise-is-so-impactful-for-advisory-firms","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Have you been competing for work that you are more than qualified to perform, only to be underbid by your competition? Or maybe you have been the one underbidding, which leaves you no room for growth or prosperity.</p><p> If you want to stop competing on price alone, it may be time to develop a stronger differentiation strategy.</p><h3> Differentiation Strategy Defined <br/>  </h3><p> There are really only two ways to gain a competitive advantage over your competition. One way is to compete on price, highlighting the similarities you share with your chief competition.</p><p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just as good as our competition, but we cost less.&rdquo;</p><p> Unfortunately, unless you have a sustainable cost advantage, you can&rsquo;t keep up this strategy for long. All it takes is someone willing to undercut your lowest price. The lowest-cost strategy also exposes you to commoditization and a much wider range of competitors, including do-it-yourself approaches, off shoring and automation.</p><p> Another way&mdash;a better way&mdash;is to stand apart. Be different. Separate yourself from the rabble in a way that is important and relevant to potential clients.</p><p> This is what is known as a differentiation strategy.</p><h3> Three Tests for a Successful Differentiator <br/>  </h3><p> How do you know you have a good differentiator? Well, we recommend you put each differentiator to the test. If it can pass these three critical checks, it is worth developing into a broader differentiation strategy:</p><h3> 1) Is it true? <br/>  </h3><p> You can&rsquo;t just make up claims of differentiation. Apart from the moral hazard of making something up, it is simply too easy for people to see through your exaggerated claims. Your firm has to live it each day. And remember, you&rsquo;ll need to deliver on all claims.</p><p> For example, many firms say they have superior client service but do nothing special to make it a reality. No special policies. No special training. Nothing to ensure it actually happens. The bottom line is they are no different than their competitors making the same claims.</p><h3> 2) Is it relevant?  <br/>  </h3><p> Any half-decent differentiator will resonate with prospective clients. If your point of distinction doesn&rsquo;t matter to them, it won&rsquo;t work in getting you more business. More importantly, what is ultimately most important is what plays into their selection criteria and decision-making process. Any non-relevant differentiators are a wasted effort.</p><p> We once had a client that believed their strongest differentiator was the lack of conflict of interest. Their competitors certainly could not make the same claim. But, when we dug a bit deeper, we realized their clients (both current and target) didn&rsquo;t value the impartiality as highly as the firm did. So much for a strong brand differentiator.</p><p> Going back to our example of client-side service. It is all too common to claim &ldquo;Customer service is our main priority.&rdquo; A lack of customer service may be a reason why you lose a client, but did you know it rarely plays into the initial selection process?</p><h3> 3) Is it provable? <br/>  </h3><p> This is the often the hardest test of a differentiator. You may have identified a true and relevant point of distinction, but it is useless without proof. Even if everyone says a differentiating statement is true, without a way to prove it, it will be ignored.</p><p> &ldquo;We have great people&rdquo; jumps to mind as an example we frequently must dissuade clients for using within their differentiation strategy. It is a trap! Why? Well, have you ever heard a firm claim they have average people?</p><p> Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p><h3> The Challenges of Maintaining a Competitive Advantage <br/>  </h3><p> You are well on your way to a solid differentiation strategy once you know what sets you apart from your competitors. Especially if you can explain&mdash;and prove&mdash;it in a way that is relevant to who you want to attract as clients. But, you are still not done.</p><p> The marketplace won&rsquo;t stand still. And your competitors will look to your success and attempt to copy it. Over time, what was once a distinctive characteristic is neutralized. As is your competitive advantage.</p><p> Therefore, a sustainable differentiation strategy requires that you build those distinctive characteristics into your reputation. As such, it becomes the foundation of your professional services brand.</p><h3> Why Visible Expertise is So Impactful for Professional Services Firms <br/>  </h3><p> This brings us to the topic of expertise and why it is so critical to professional services.</p><p> When you talk about professional services, expertise is what you sell.</p><p> Put another way, clients aren&rsquo;t buying your services because they like them. They are buying your services to solve a problem. Maybe they need help complying with a regulatory requirement or they need a solution to a specific strategic challenge.</p><p> Our research highlights the reasons why a company would select one professional services firm over another. Expertise is the top selection criteria for most prospects, and it is most frequently the factor that tips the scale for the contract-winning firm.</p><p> But what about the argument that professional services are &ldquo;a relationship business&rdquo;? Well, that assumption is true. But when you look at the research, the only factor that trumps a great relationship is expertise.</p><p> As we outline in Inside the Buyer&rsquo;s Brain, both buyers and sellers of professional services understand the importance of an existing relationship, but sellers consistently underestimate the role their reputation plays in the final selection.</p><p> Also, a strong reputation for expertise is the one factor that can overcome an existing relationship. If a company does not believe their current provider can solve a problem, they will look for someone who can.</p><p> Not long ago, a prospective client came to us for our marketing expertise. He had hired a life-long friend to help with his marketing. Despite their close relationship, he had fired his friend (and hired Hinge) because his friend could not solve his marketing challenge. Our strong reputation for solving the specific marketing challenges of professional services firms was more important then their strong relationship.</p><p> And to add to the argument of expertise as a differentiation strategy, we can look to the latest research on professional services referrals. According to our most recent study of referral marketing, visible expertise plays the single most significant role in driving referrals (37.3% of all referral-driving factors). Relationships, both social and professional are still important, but only when there is an awareness of your expertise.</p><h3> Overcoming the Problem of Invisibility <br/>  </h3><p> Developing expertise as a differentiation strategy sounds like a great idea, but there is a catch. Clients are notoriously uninformed when it comes to judging actual expertise. Consequently, your firm&rsquo;s expertise is often unseen by the marketplace.</p><p> And if your firm&rsquo;s expertise is not visible it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p><p> Fortunately, it is possible to make intangible expertise visible and real.</p><p> We conducted extensive research on highly visible experts and the professional services buyers who hire them. As we outline in The Visible Expert, there are certain strategies and techniques that work well in elevating the visibility of your expertise in the marketplace.</p><p> Public speaking, writing blog posts and articles, and books are all great ways to demonstrate your expertise. And other strategies and approaches are helpful in boosting the visibility of that expertise, either as a firm (or practice within a larger firm) or as an individual. The value of these different techniques, when put together as part of a differentiation strategy, has been proven time and again by our clients.</p><h3> Building Your Differentiation Strategy <br/>  </h3><p> The only proven way of making your expertise visible so that it can work as a differentiator is to have a clear strategy.</p><p> Start with an understanding of exactly what you want to be known for. What are you expert in? Your area of expertise should be broad enough to be enduring and important. But that breadth must be balanced. The narrower and more specialized your expertise, the easier it is to make it visible and defend against potential competitors.</p><p> The next step is research. Research will help you align your firm&rsquo;s offerings with the desires and preferences of potential clients. It will also inform your selection of issues to write about to make your expertise more visible to your target audience. We have found that research of your target client group is associated with growth. In fact, the fastest growing firms (those that grow as much as 20% year over year) are twice as likely to conduct research as their no-growth peers.</p><h3> Upon Implementing Your Differentiation Strategy</h3><p> The research on using expertise as a differentiation strategy is still evolving. We know that highly visible experts accelerate the growth of a firm both by attracting new leads and making it easier to close them as clients. We also know the fastest growing, most profitable firms use strategies and marketing techniques that raise the visibility of their expertise.</p><p> With a well thought-out strategy and diligent implementation, you&rsquo;ll see your firm&rsquo;s visibility and perceived expertise accelerate.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-06 16:11:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-06 16:11:18.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_dWSgIqq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/differentiation-why-visible-expertise-is-so-impactful-for-advisory-firms/\", \"post_id\": \"12290\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-06 16:11:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-06 16:11:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"differentiation-why-visible-expertise-is-so-impactful-for-advisory-firms\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12289\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5968\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Why-Visible-Expertise-is-So-Impactful-for-Advisory-Firms.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1011\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467882000,"author_id":300,"chart_url":""}

There&rsquo;s squabbling with my siblings, stress with my mom and, happily, lots of love too. It&rsquo;s tough when multiple people move in for a few weeks, and although the house is big, we&rsquo;re on top of each other.</p><p> Earlier today, I was over the edge with the way the morning was unfolding. So angry I saw red, I needed a quick fix to change my experience &ndash;  *poof* tension transformed into loving kindness. Dreams, right?</p><p> No magic pill to turn around a bad day, an hour and a large iced hazelnut coffee from Dunkin Donuts gave me time and space to cool off both literally and figuratively.</p><p> Later in the afternoon, I was a lot more chill and made a grocery store run for a family mberry tasting party. If you don&rsquo;t know what mberry is, it&rsquo;s a miracle berry (or in this case a tablet that dissolves on your tongue). Mberry makes sour and bitter things taste sweet and sweet things taste like they were dipped in a vat of sugar.</p><p> Limes tasted like limeade.</p><p> Tomatoes were luscious.</p><p> Grapefruit as if someone was liberal with sprinkling sugar.</p><p> Tonic water so saccharine I could only take a sip.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Sucking on an mberry tablet, I was thinking even more about what I, and my clients, could do to take the sour moments in life and make them sweet once again.</p><p> When I was fuming, it was like a smoldering fire that quickly expanded to everyone around me and engulfed us all in negativity. At this point, there were two choices: either we&rsquo;d go up in flames, or I needed to start a more positive chain reaction to turn around the day. (Did you catch that? choice&hellip;)</p><p> Bet you&rsquo;ve been there too.</p><p> Something goes wrong, and you&rsquo;re angry, frustrated, and even worse, ready to take it out on anyone who crosses your path. Even as it&rsquo;s happening, you feel like it&rsquo;s impossible to stop. Day ruined.</p><p> It does not have to be that way. You too can make another choice.</p><h3> Five Must-Dos to Turn Around a Bad Day (and make your bitter moments sweeter) <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t Assume Your Bad Day is Unstoppable <br/>  </h3><p> When you&rsquo;re a grumpster, you&rsquo;ve bought into a terrible experience like it&rsquo;s your destiny. One bad thing happens, then the next and by the third you know it&rsquo;s coming. The forth just confirms that there&rsquo;s no hope of anything good. Get real. The first step to making any change is noticing that you need to make a change. Yup &ndash; didn&rsquo;t say nothing bad would happen, just that you can change even when your circumstances cannot.</p><h3> 2. Give Yourself Time and Space <br/>  </h3><p> The mberry tablet took a few minutes to melt on my tongue. It wasn&rsquo;t instantaneous. When you&rsquo;re fuming, you need a moment too. Take a walk down the hall to breathe, suck on a tic tac or play a quick round of Candy Crush. Do something that will help you to take a beat and step away from what&rsquo;s triggering your negativity.</p><h3> 3. Pump Up the Volume  <br/>  </h3><p> Music relaxes the nervous system and propels you to make positive shifts in mind and body. When you put on music that brings you energy and joy, you start to feel energy and joy. Want to feel more relaxed and chilled out? Maybe you need some Yanni (probably not) or whatever tune fills you with peace. Pump it up even if you have to put your earphones on and create your own little music-universe.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4. Accept a Little Sweeter is Better than Sour <br/>  </h3><p> Some of the things we tasted after our tablets melted were not remarkably different than the original until we stopped to consider what had changed. For example, I bought dill pickles for our tasting pleasure and the general comments were that they tasted like pickles, and everyone was unimpressed. However, when I pointed out that they tasted like bread and butter pickles (sweet!) everyone oohed and aahed.</p><p> Never poo-poo small changes that take you in the right direction. Not every shift will be a leap.</p><h3> 5. Let Go of Your Negative Expectations and Assumptions <br/>  </h3><p> You can stop your bad day when you stop assuming that the next thing that happens will be equally awful (or worse!) than the last. When you are sure about what&rsquo;s yet to come, you&rsquo;re creating it. Imagine that your thoughts could create your experience &ndash; positive, negative you choose. Whoa!</p><p> At our mberry tasting party, there were skeptics and others who were ready to believe that things would be different. We all knew that a pickle was still a pickle and cream cheese the same that we put on our bagels this morning. Who do you think had the biggest shift in flavor &ndash; those who accepted that it would work or those who were sure it was impossible?</p><p> Will I take another mberry tablet? Probably not. Will the experience stick with me? You bet. In fact, along with a deep breath, I&rsquo;ll visualize taking a mberry for my life to bring a little more sweetness to life&rsquo;s sour moments.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-06 16:14:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-06 16:14:25.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_pPri2Sm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-must-dos-to-turn-around-a-bad-day-and-make-your-bitter-moments-sweeter/\", \"post_id\": \"12292\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-06 16:14:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-06 16:14:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-must-dos-to-turn-around-a-bad-day-and-make-your-bitter-moments-sweeter\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12291\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5969\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-Must-Dos-to-Turn-Around-a-Bad-Day-and-Make-Your-Bitter-Moments-Sweeter.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"894\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467907200,"author_id":15,"chart_url":""}

The strange thing is though: 80% of sales people simply won&rsquo;t take the time or make the effort to do it.I&rsquo;ve always said that the best thing about sales is that 80 to 90% of the objections, stalls, put offs and situations you run into day after the day are the same. The blow offs you got yesterday, are the same ones you got last month and that you&rsquo;ll get next month &ndash; and next year.Think about it: how many times do you hear this when you prospect or cold call:From the gatekeeper:&ldquo;Will he know what this call is regarding?&rdquo;From the prospect:&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be interested.&rdquo;&ldquo;We already have someone who handles that.&rdquo;&ldquo;Just email me something.&rdquo;<h3> Do any of these sound familiar? Of course they do! And I&rsquo;ll bet you could add another five or seven, couldn&rsquo;t you?</h3>And how about when you close a sale? How about:&ldquo;We just aren&rsquo;t ready to make a decision yet.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to talk to my partner/spouse/committee.&rdquo;&ldquo;Your price isn&rsquo;t in our budget.&rdquo;Are these sounding familiar? Of course they are! And, once again, you could easily come up with about five or seven more.And here&rsquo;s the point: There are only about seven or nine objections or stalls per selling situation per product or service. You keep getting them over and over and over again!Now here&rsquo;s the problem: Most sales reps don&rsquo;t take the time to develop, script out, and then practice, drill and rehearse the most effective responses until they know them backward and forward and can deliver them automatically like a pro.Instead, 80% of sales reps (and sales teams!) choose to ad-lib a different response &ndash; or worse, an ineffective response &ndash; each time they get one of these repeatable stalls or objections. This makes them uncomfortable when they get resistance, makes them give up easily, and makes them not want to cold call or call people back to close them (classic phone resistance).It makes their sales lives a living nightmare&hellip;##TRENDING##The top producers, on the other hand, have taken the time to develop, memorize and then deliver effective responses to these objections, and so they easily handle and overcome them. They are not afraid of getting resistance, instead, they&rsquo;re prepared for it. Knowing what&rsquo;s coming and being prepared for it enables them to listen to what their prospect is saying, allows them to question the objection and find out what is really holding a prospect back.And this makes them confident. This allows them to stay in the game and overcome stalls and objections when other sales reps fold and go away. This allows them to persevere and get the sale.In addition, it allows them to do their job easily and without stress because they know in advance what&rsquo;s coming, and they are prepared for it!It&rsquo;s like with the objection of: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to need to ask the boss.&rdquo;Eighty percent of sales reps handle this incorrectly by saying something like: &ldquo;Well, when should I call you back?&rdquo;By doing it this way, they simply create a stall, and then they worry that when they finally do hear back from the prospect, the answer will be, &ldquo;Well, the boss doesn&rsquo;t want to do it.&rdquo;How many times does this happen to you?A top producer, on the other hand, handles this very differently. She would say:&ldquo;I understand and let me ask you something. If your boss likes this and tells you to do whatever you think is best, based on what we&rsquo;ve just gone over, what would you likely do?&rdquo;##PAGE_BREAK##This is called isolating the objection, and based on what the prospect then says, the top producer will take the next effective steps.This is what I mean by knowing what&rsquo;s coming in advance, and then being able to effectively, confidently and easily handle it.And that&rsquo;s your assignment for this week. Start by making a list of all the stalls, put offs and objections you get with your sale during the various stages of contact. Then commit to learning, scripting and then practicing the best responses to them.Once you&rsquo;ve found the ones that work (and I recommend you script out three or four responses for each objection), spend the time practice, drill and rehearse those best practice responses until you can deliver them automatically.I&rsquo;m reminded of the importance of this when I recall an interview with Don Shula of the Miami Dolphins. He said that his players practice each move, each technique over and over again until they are automatic.He said that if his players get into a game situation and have to think about what to do next, it&rsquo;s too late. He said they had to be able to respond instantly, automatically with the best technique in every situation they get into.It&rsquo;s the same with you and sales.If you are willing to do this &ndash; again, what 80% of your competition won&rsquo;t take the time and effort to do &ndash; then soon you will enjoy closing more sales, making more money, and living a more confident and successful life as a sales professional.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-06 16:19:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-06 16:19:38.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_NtnitEy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-have-these-characteristics-of-a-top-sales-producer/\", \"post_id\": \"12294\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-06 16:19:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-06 16:19:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-have-these-characteristics-of-a-top-sales-producer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12293\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5970\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Do-You-Have-These-Characteristics-of-a-Top-Sales-Producer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"694\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467892800,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5734,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Chameleon Effect: How It Can Improve (Or Ruin) Your Marketing","link":"the-chameleon-effect-how-it-can-improve-or-ruin-your-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Coined by Tanya Chartrand and John Bargh in the &lsquo;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&rsquo;, the Chameleon Effect has a profound impact on your every move in the digital marketing world.</p><p> If your email marketing, landing pages, and conversion oriented pages aren&rsquo;t performing how you&rsquo;d like, this could be the cause.</p><h3> What Is the Chameleon Effect? <br/>  </h3><p> Essentially, the Chameleon Effect describes how we naturally imitate those around us through casual, non-intensive observation. Simply seeing someone do something increases our likelihood of doing the same behavior.</p><p> If you see someone scratch their nose, yawn, or look up at the sky you naturally become more disposed to engage in the same behavior.</p><p> Similarly, if you look at most social media profiles, email sends, landing pages, etc you&rsquo;ll see that there are strong similarities between all industries.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the Chameleon Effect at work.</p><p> Whether aware of it or not, when we jump on the internet we leave ourselves open to the influence of other marketer&rsquo;s activities.</p><p> With so much noise in the online world, it&rsquo;s easy to start emulating other marketers whose strategies may not necessarily produce the results we desire.</p><p> The process can be subtle at first.</p><p> One slight change to our online email pitch, for example, could come from a prior marketing eblast we received weeks before.</p><p> Gradually, however, the Chameleon Effect can continue to influence the strategies and campaigns we execute.</p><p> If we are not careful, it&rsquo;s easy to get swallowed by the wave of what everyone else is doing, losing touch with the essence of direct response.</p><p> Fortunately, by becoming aware of the Chameleon Effect, we can leverage it to our advantage. This can be accomplished with a few simple techniques.</p><h3> Make Result-Focused Case Studies A Part of Your Daily Diet <br/>  </h3><p> With the ample amount of case studies published each day online, reading one each day will fill your mind with informative, inspirational, successful marketing campaigns.</p><p> Read them. Study them. Devour them.</p><p> Each day go through a new one and dust off an older one you&rsquo;ve read month&rsquo;s earlier. You&rsquo;ll find yourself absorbing fresh insights and perspectives you missed the first time around.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Create a Swipe File Toolbox <br/>  </h3><p> When you have a new email subject line to write, what better way to ensure success than by flipping through hundreds of successful, sales-pulling subject lines?</p><p> A swipe file, or collection of successful ads, allows you to quickly brainstorm possible ideas for your campaign.</p><p> Most successful direct response marketers &ndash; both online and offline &ndash; have their own swipe file, often with decades of successful ads to pull from.</p><p> For social media, you could compile the headlines, tweets, Facebook posts, and images that gathered the most shares.</p><p> For sales-focused ad campaigns you could collect banner ads and landing pages.</p><p> Services like  <a href=\"http://www.adbeat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AdBeat </a> ,  <a href=\"https://www.whatrunswhere.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  WhatRunsWhere </a> , and Who&rsquo;s Mailing What streamline the ad collection process, allowing you to gather insight into the ad campaigns your competitors are running.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Take Things Apart and Build Them Back Again <br/>  </h3><p> Legendary copywriter Gary Halbert advised copy cubs to rewrite, by hand, successful sales letters. While I don&rsquo;t know how scientifically valid this recommendation is, taking successful ad campaigns apart surely gives you more insight than just a casual viewing.</p><p> What emotions does the ad trigger? How are features introduced in the campaign? What benefits are anchored to these features? Are stories and metaphors used to elicit understanding?</p><p> In music composition and writing classes, students are taught to take apart the structure and form of masterpieces down to the most minute details.</p><p> By taking the same approach to online ad campaigns, you gain the same benefit &ndash; improved ability.</p><h3> Surround Yourself With Winners <br/>  </h3><p> When bombarded with hundreds of emails per day, thousands of status updates, and banner ads everywhere, it&rsquo;s easy to be influenced by the many ineffective sales pitches we&rsquo;re exposed to.</p><p> The Chameleon Effect will always have its influence on what we do as marketers. Nevertheless, by paying extra careful &ndash; and purposeful &ndash; attention to successful ad campaigns, we make ourselves more likely to mirror what works, not just what we&rsquo;re unavoidably exposed to.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-06 16:21:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-06 16:21:38.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_sp8xrOo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-chameleon-effect-how-it-can-improve-or-ruin-your-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"12296\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-06 16:21:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-06 16:21:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-chameleon-effect-how-it-can-improve-or-ruin-your-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12295\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5971\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Chameleon-Effect-How-It-Can-Improve-Or-Ruin-Your-Marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1518\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467914400,"author_id":20,"chart_url":""}

Staying relevant means staying top of mind, providing insight, solving issues, opening dialogues, and engaging with your network.  Content is key to staying relevant on social media, whether you are curating or creating original content.</p><p> It is shocking that in this technologically advanced day and super information age, that there is a major disconnect in the understanding of curating relevant content, and distributing or sharing that content digitally via social media.  We are absolutely inundated with content on a daily basis&hellip; to the point that it is becoming white noise.</p><p> One of the training programs we provide at AAL is focused on content marketing on social media, including where to find relevant content, what type of content is actually relevant to your purpose, and how to distribute the content on various social media platforms.  Each social media platform varies on when the highest rate of activity can be anticipated based on overall metrics.</p><p> Frequency of posts on social platforms are also a variable in determining whether your content reached its target.  The lifespan of a LinkedIn post, FB post, and tweet are all incredibly different from each other, and understanding when, where, and how often to post content is crucial in your content being visible in order result in maximum exposure.</p><h3> The most common push-backs I hear when a training launches are: <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know what to write about, and I don&rsquo;t know what to curate.&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;Where can I possibly find enough content to post that often?&rdquo;</p><p> Listen folks, content is all around us&hellip; it is the matrix.  We receive content through blogs that we follow, company newsletters, company blogs, thought leaders we follow, industry news, apps, google alerts, on LinkedIn, Twitter, and yes even FB&hellip; we are in a constant state of drinking content from the firehose.  It&rsquo;s so standard and available, we don&rsquo;t even see it for the power it actually holds.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Just image if you knew what content would position you as a subject matter expert in your purpose, then were able to find enough relevant content to provide a stream of information to your network on a daily, week, monthly basis.  The potential to engage with unlimited professionals that are your actual targets, with content relevant to you and to them, on social media&hellip; is so much larger than you can possibly know until you experience it first-hand.  And you should experience it first-hand.</p><p> I just recently recorded this short video blog on curating relevant content.

These generally include the C-suite positions, as well as the payroll manager, the president or CEO&rsquo;s executive assistant, and other vital roles. In order to fill these positions, businesses can either look within their current employee pool or they can look outside the company for a qualified candidate.</p><p> Looking outside the company often means finding a candidate who is currently filling one of the identified key roles for another organization. When hired, that candidate then brings his current experience in the role to the new organization. Theoretically, that experience decreases training and transition time, imparting two huge advantages for management and the executive board and increasing the odds of success for the candidate.</p><p> Internal candidates, in contrast, don&rsquo;t possess direct experience but they offer a number of advantages over external candidates.

{"original_id":5738,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Five Factors of Smart Beta Investing","link":"the-five-factors-of-smart-beta-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"//insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=qoe326g&amp;ct=0:v0ks54e&amp;fmt=3\" width=\"1\"/></p><p> Written by: Dave Gedeon / Head of Research &amp; Development, Nasdaq Global Indexes</p><p> Although recent interest in factor-based investing would lead one to believe that this is a new-fangled trend, the truth is factor-based investing has existed for decades. In fact, it has been a key component in the stock selection framework of active managers for years. At its core, factor-based investing involves identifying characteristics in a group of securities that help explain its risk/return profile. For example, value investing is a factor-based strategy that focuses on a subset of stocks that displays attractive valuation metrics relative to the general market. Thanks to smart beta, investors today can gain exposure to this factor and a wide array of others with ease, in a transparent and low cost vehicle.</p><p> These well-known investment factors have become the guiding philosophy behind a large swath of smart beta products. Third party research 1  indicates that these factors deliver results with returns in excess of market capitalization strategies over the long run. Each individual factor may not outperform every year, but over time the factors can provide a superior risk/return profile to the broad market. Moreover, factor strategies tend to display low correlation with each other as each is driven by a different set of risk factors.</p><p> There are many factors at an investor&rsquo;s disposal, and the explanations of investment returns are limitless. The five factors of focus in this piece are Volatility, Momentum,  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BlspnNxzg&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLqDHF2tkRWOq7GcaLJtlD2u7PKZe-T02R\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Quality </a> , Size and Value. Perhaps more important than the explanation of the factors is an investor&rsquo;s ability to select a factor that is favorable in certain market environments or even to combine several factors into a single portfolio.</p><p> <strong>  Low volatility. </strong>  The concept of low volatility or low beta is simple yet powerful. A portfolio comprised of stocks with lower volatility when compared to its benchmark can produce higher risk-adjusted returns and generally produce a superior information ratio over all periods. This factor becomes increasingly potent in times of market strife such as witnessed in 2008.</p><p> <strong>  Momentum. </strong>  This factor is generally viewed as the opposite of volatility. A relative strength or momentum strategy picks stocks that have historically outperformed the market as studies show that this outperformance is likely to continue in the short to medium term.  <a href=\"http://dorseywright.com/research\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Much research </a>  has been done on this factor, and it is important to be able to harness momentum in the right market environment.</p><p> <strong>  Quality. </strong>  The notion of quality has gained steam during the economic recovery and U.S. equity bull market since 2009. Quality focuses on factors such as equity return, leverage ratio, and earnings variability. This factor can exhibit strong returns over time as the companies that fit this mold have consistent track records.</p><p> <strong>  Value. </strong>  One of the originally identified smart beta factors is value which seeks to identify the disconnect between a company&rsquo;s stock price and its intrinsic value. Ratios such as price to earnings and price-to-book are used to take advantage of this disconnect.</p><p> <strong>  Size. </strong>  Smaller capitalization stocks tend to outperform over the long run. The key notion here is that smaller capitalization stocks within a benchmark tend to outperform the larger capitalization stocks within that same benchmark.</p><h3> Portfolios of Factor Exposures</h3><p> <br/> The interest in factor exposures has provided investors with the opportunity to not only focus on asset class diversification, but to also build a diversified portfolio of factor exposures. For example, for more defensive positioning, managers can create a simple blend of the three least volatile factors: low volatility, quality and value. A less risk-averse outlook can create a portfolio in which all five factors are equally weighted. If an investor is particularly aggressive, the blend would emphasize the two highest volatility factors: momentum and size.</p><p> Of course the question asked is &ldquo;How do I utilize each factor in a consistent manner?&rdquo; As recent articles have pointed out, all of these factors have exhibited outperformance over the market during the past 20 years. Though to realize that outperformance an investor would have to ride through the ups and downs of the long market cycle. The easiest answer to the question is to throw the factors into a Nutribullet and blend away.</p><h3> The Best Recipe for Blending Factors</h3><p> <br/> Multi-factor solutions have been created lately to blend the benefits of each factor into a single investment strategy. The concept is pretty simple: select the companies that have the highest factor attribution of the main factors and blend them together into a single index. While often these multi-factor strategies can outperform the benchmark, there is still the risk that the index is not properly defining the timing and best usage of an individual factor. The multi-factor blend is a strategic asset allocation, a basic catchall strategy that looks great on paper. We&rsquo;ve moved to a tactical world so strategies must follow suit.</p><p> Our favored approach, instead, is to take advantage of the most powerful factor, momentum, and apply that factor as the selection overlay to the other factors: size, volatility, value and growth. The goal is to utilize the momentum signal as the basis for deciding which factor is in favor in the market. That selected factor will then be the single exposure for the index as long as the factor is in favor. The result is a &ldquo;momentum + factor model&rdquo; that will take advantage of momentum plus the most favored factor.</p><p> This methodology is rooted in an objective relative strength ranking of the factors' price performance each month which results in rebalancing each month. By rotating between these factors, the index will focus on the favored factor and take advantage of particular market trends. Examples are aplenty, whether it is Low Volatility exposure from July 2008 to March 2009 or Pure Value exposure from August 2012 to December 2013 resulting in a 60% gain in the underlying strategy value.</p><p> When looking to gain exposure to factors it is important to know how to combine them together. A blended approach is a simple solution but does not fully capture the benefit of relative strength selecting the factors.</p><p> Utilizing a relative strength overlay on powerful single factors drastically improves return and lowers volatility yielding a strong information ratio. This investment thesis also solves the problem of when to be invested and for how long. Taking the guesswork out of factors prevents riding the ups and downs of each known factor and instead pivots the exposure to the right factor at the right time, for the right amount of time.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/factor-rotation.png\" width=\"785\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/factor-rotation-us.png\" width=\"584\"/></p><p> All values back-tested, exclude dividends and are rebalanced at each month-end.

Five of these factors are Momentum, Volatility, Quality, Size, and Value. Multi-factor approaches to smart beta include a combination of a number of factors in a one-ticker solution. As great as multi-factor products can be, tactical rotation products (products that can rotate in or out of products in a rules-based, transparent fashion) tend to outperform given their ability to adapt to changing market dynamics. At Nasdaq, we believe highly in the momentum factor. Over the long term, momentum with an additional factor is one form of factor rotation that has performed quite impressively over the last 13 years. Tactical factor rotation is the newest smart beta trend, one which we expect to perpetuate for years to come.</p><p> <a href=\"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite#!?cat=5044116631024\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Read more from Nasdaq Global Indexes </a> .</p>Nasdaq&reg; is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.

Very often I suggest new methods of lead generation through social media.  Frequently I get responses such as:</p><li> But Sara, I&rsquo;m already using social media and it&rsquo;s going nowhere. </li><li> I tried this already, Sara, and it didn&rsquo;t work. I sell a high quality product.  My clients are not the type to buy on the Internet.  I&rsquo;m not selling to broke 20 year olds on Twitter, Sara! (By the way, did you know that 41% of millionaires use LinkedIn.  It is in fact not just for college kids and not everybody on there is broke!) <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6354340189304962772#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a> <br/>  </li><h3> Social media fails to generate leads when any one of the following 10 things are happening.</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Your content has not been properly designed to lead the right people to see you and your advice as valuable</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s got to be too good to be ignored, or else it will be ignored. This sounds harsh, but it is the truth.  The way to get there is not by talking about you.  It&rsquo;s by getting into the buyer&rsquo;s head, their subconscious mind.  The best blog posts are those which provide the reader with information that answers questions people have, but don&rsquo;t necessarily realize that they have. One woman I know had tremendous success because she was featured in a prominent article entitled, &ldquo;Do I really sound like that when I talk?&rdquo; She is a speech therapist and the business   Think about it. This is something that crosses people&rsquo;s minds all the time, but they never ponder it in detail.  Your content has to make a light bulb go off in people&rsquo;s heads.  When you do, responsiveness increases.</p><p> The other thing is, are you talking to the right level of a buyer.  If you are selling luxury suits, do your YouTube videos feature demonstrations of how to properly hang a suit on a hanger?  Think about it &ndash; do you think the people who buy Zegna suits don&rsquo;t know how to take care of them?  The people who are going to search for information about how to hang up a suit are college kids or first time suit buyers.  Not likely to buy Zegna! A better topic would have been a video about how to pick a business suit to wear to a Board meeting.  Here you&rsquo;re targeting the higher level executive who probably already owns a luxury suit or two.</p><h3> 2. Your posts are not properly tagged</h3><p> <br/> Most people, even if they buy in person, at least check out the product and its competitors on the Internet before they make the purchase.  The algorithms used by search engines are constantly changing.  Are you updating your tags with them?  If not, all the money you spent on SEO has now gone down the drain.  People typically make the mistake of tagging the post with words that describe the post.  A more effective way is to tag with words that people type into the search box.</p><h3> 3. You are not interacting the right way, quickly enough, or frequently enough, with the people who like or comment on your postings</h3><p> <br/> When somebody asks a question, posts a comment, likes, or forwards one of your postings, you have a short amount of time to respond and motivate them to take the next action.  In the age of social media, you have 24 hours for an article to be &ldquo;live&rdquo; and then it fades away.  If you are too busy to respond, you&rsquo;re wasting all the effort you put in to get people&rsquo;s attention in the first place.   Do not assume that they will take the action on their own &ndash; you have to lead them there. Appoint a marketing specialist to assume your identity on social media and follow up if you lack time to do so.</p><p> After a reader responds, you should thank them as the first thing you do.  Then quickly take the next step, such as sending them a white paper, asking for their email address, or directing them to another posting on the subject.  They&rsquo;re way more likely to do what you want if you get them right after they post.</p><h3> 4. There is something wrong with your professional presentation. </h3><p> <br/> Spelling errors, grammatical errors, unprofessional LinkedIn picture, website is too slow or crashes frequently, website text is too small, not colorful enough, information clearly hasn&rsquo;t been updated in months or years.  All of these things say to the reader, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really care about how I present myself to the public.&rdquo;  Why would anyone buy from you when the next competitor is just a click away?  Really, that is how competitive it is!</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 5. You are not posting frequently enough.</h3><p> <br/> In sales, they say that people need to be contacted 5-6 times before they respond.  There is so much noise in the media and people are inundated.  Don&rsquo;t expect to get noticed if you post a blog every month.  I post every day but I&rsquo;m a professional writer and can get my stuff out super fast.  I would suggest a weekly or biweekly posting at minimum.  Never sacrifice quality for quantity though.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 6. Once people get interested, they can&rsquo;t find you.</h3><p> <br/> Imagine that you read this great blog post and then you Google the writer and they don&rsquo;t come up anywhere.  The only thing you could do would be initiate a friend request on LinkedIn but you don&rsquo;t have their email address.  It goes no further.  Or, you search for their website and you can&rsquo;t find it because it&rsquo;s on page 2 of Google.  Yes, page 2 of Google.  That is how impatient a society we have become.</p><h3> 7. You are not including a call to action</h3><p> <br/> Even the most motivating of content can get lost if there is no clear indication of what the reader should do next to benefit from your expertise.  At a minimum, at the end of your post you should encourage readers to subscribe to all your channels. Offering a small giveaway such as &ldquo;The first 20 people to like this post will receive a copy of my monthly economic commentary&rdquo; is an even better example of how to get more visibility with your audience in a way that drives home your value.</p><h3> 8. Your title or first two lines are boring.</h3><p> <br/> If you had to choose between two frozen yogurt restaurants, one with a bold bright sign called Bananas for Yogurt, and the other one with a faded, chipping sign called Frozen Yogurt Store, which one would you pick?  It&rsquo;s that much of a jungle out there folks. The most immediately engaging content, not the most intelligent, is the one that attracts viewers.</p><h3> 9. Your content is negative</h3><p> <br/> In an effort to get people&rsquo;s attention, you may perhaps be coming off as too critical of the buyers that you are intending to attract. Ask yourself these questions.  Is our tone condescending?  It&rsquo;s so easy to sound shrill in writing.  Are we making the prospect feel stupid by ragging on them for having the challenge that our product solves?  You may be turning people off inadvertently.</p><h3> 10. You lack a grand finale</h3><p> <br/> Yes folks, as important as it is to draw people in with our first two lines, you&rsquo;ve got to inspire them to forward your posting by doing something exciting at the end.

{"original_id":5740,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Fascinating Facts About B2B Advertising in 2016","link":"6-fascinating-facts-about-b2b-advertising-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> B2B businesses are constantly innovating and coming up with new advertising techniques. In an ever-evolving world, it can be tough to know where to put your money. Here are some trends that may help you as you inspect your marketing strategy for 2016 and beyond.</p><h3> 1. CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IS A KEY INDICATOR OF SUCCESS</h3><p> <br/> With more and more focus on the digital experience and how to market to an oversaturated audience, customer service has taken a back seat to engagement and the constant push for fresh content. However, as many are discovering, a great customer experience can be its own form of positive marketing. As a result, manyB2B businesses are reinvigorating their efforts toward the positive customer experience.</p><h3> 2. CONTENT MARKETING IS A MUST, BUT MOST BUSINESSES HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO ACHIEVE IT</h3><p> <br/> According to the  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2016_B2B_Report_Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Content Marketing Institute </a> , only 44% of B2B businesses say they have a clear understanding of what it means to be successful at content marketing. With so much chatter about content being king and the continual emphasis put on developing content, you would think it would almost be second nature at this point. However, over half the B2B businesses don&rsquo;t have any idea what a successful content marketing strategy even looks like.</p><h3> 3. LINKEDIN LEADS THE WAY</h3><p> <br/> According to  <a href=\"http://memarketingservices.com/10-marketing-facts-you-need-to-know-going-into-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ME Marketing Services </a>  and the  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2016_B2B_Report_Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Content Marketing Institute </a> , LinkedIn is the most common platform B2B businesses use for their content marketing strategy. It also is credited with being the most successful avenue for reaching customers. LinkedIn is followed in succession by Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.</p><h3> 4. ADVOCACY MARKETING IS THE NEW BUZZWORD</h3><p> <br/> It is commonly known that many businesses put more effort into getting people to purchase with little follow-up. Advocacy marketing is the idea that works in reverse. Rather than directing efforts toward the process leading up to the sale, many B2B businesses are finding success in utilizing happy customers as advocates. By converting loyal customers to advocates, many companies are growing their current customer base by word-of- mouth.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 5. VIDEO CONTENT IS ON THE RISE</h3><p> <br/> According to Knowledge Tree, video content is responsible for approximately 2/3 of consumer traffic. This is a huge number you should not ignore. Need a fresh approach to content? Put some effort into developing interesting and pertinent videos and you will not be disappointed.</p><h3> 6. DIGITAL MARKETING IS DISAPPEARING</h3><p> <br/> This trend has been slowly creeping up on us, and if you believe the guys at  <a href=\"http://www.business2community.com/b2b-marketing/9-b2b-marketing-trends-watch-2016-01386396\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Business 2 Community </a> , digital marketing is almost at an end. This could signal a slight relaxing in the B2B world. All this really means is that the idea of digital marketing as a category all its own is at an end. Digital marketing is now the way of the world and therefore does not need to be treated as a separate marketing strategy, but rather, it is your marketing strategy.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-07 14:16:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-07 14:16:36.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_HMU1QYG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-fascinating-facts-about-b2b-advertising-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"12309\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-07 14:16:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-07 14:16:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-fascinating-facts-about-b2b-advertising-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12308\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5977\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/6-Fascinating-Facts-About-B2B-Advertising-in-2016.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"613\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467964800,"author_id":438,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5741,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Writing a Book Is a Game Changer","link":"writing-a-book-is-a-game-changer","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Why should you, or I for that matter, consider writing a book, when there are so many of them out there already?</h3><p> <br/> Good question. The answer is that there are many reasons. Guy Kawasaki in his book  APE: Author, Publisher, Entrepreneur  says there are four main reasons: 1) to impart knowledge, 2) to further a cause, 3) for the intellectual challenge, and 4) catharsis. Let me explain:</p><p> <strong>  To impart knowledge &ndash;  </strong> it is wonderful when we can get what is in our heads into the heads of others. A book, if well written, is one way to do that.</p><p> <strong>  To further a cause &ndash;  </strong> Rachel Carson wrote  Silent Spring  to encourage farmers to &ldquo;put away that DDT.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  For the intellectual challenge &ndash;  </strong> the process of thinking through a concept or a challenge, then editing your thoughts and rewriting them, can be a very meaningful and productive exercise. One thing to keep in mind when I say &ldquo;exercise,&rdquo; is that it isn&rsquo;t a sprint, it is more of a marathon.</p><p> <strong>  Catharsis &ndash;  </strong> when I wrote  Men Really DO Listen: How Men Listen Differently Than Others , it felt exhilarating to finally  finish it. Endorphins were released, the stars lined up and everything was right in the world (for the time being, anyway). To me, it gave me the impression that I had just written my doctoral dissertation.</p><p> People say to me &ldquo;Someday I&rsquo;ll write a book.&rdquo; Well, someday turns into months and months turn into years. Years turn into decades and decades add up. Pretty soon you are talking about your entire life. Most people die with their book still in them.</p><p> The reality is a book can make you a minor (or major) celebrity. A book can get you on TV, radio and podcasts. Financially, it can set you up to receive streams of passive income. A book can open doors for you and lead to more speaking engagements and consulting gigs. And you can command higher speaking fees as a result. It can enhance your brand and position you as a thought leader. A book in the hands of your prospect or client tells them you know what you are talking about. It places the image in their mind that you are the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; person in the market.</p><h3> Perhaps most importantly, it can also be your legacy for future generations.</h3><p> <br/> So, the original question may not even be a fair to begin with. The way it is posed almost pretends that it has already been done (by someone else), that it&rsquo;s not worth doing. My response to that may seem quixotic. It is that is there&rsquo;s always a need for a cogent message. Who know? You might even reach the unreachable. That&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</p><p> The bottom line is the book publishing world has changed. It used to be that consumers decided a book was worthy of reading if it were put out by a well known publisher. If it was a reputable publisher, the thinking went, the book must be relevant and well written. That&rsquo;s no longer the case.  In the digital world we live in, people put more faith in the number of stars the book got online (e.g., Amazon) than who the publisher is.</p><p> A book can be a game changer. Is yours a &ldquo;dream in a drawer,&rdquo; or a published work?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-07 14:29:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-07 14:29:23.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_qzMruDX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/writing-a-book-is-a-game-changer/\", \"post_id\": \"12311\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-07 14:29:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-07 14:29:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"writing-a-book-is-a-game-changer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12310\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5979\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Writing-a-Book-Is-a-Game-Changer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"707\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468004400,"author_id":178,"chart_url":""}

Social media, moving away from family, working longer hours, texting, and communication via screens have all contributed to our lack of listening skills.  </p><p> Listening is a skill, which has to be practiced.  It makes me laugh when the most attended meeting breakouts are on products or practice management when they should focus on the human aspects of running a business, retaining and getting new clients.  Most believe because they communicate all day, they are good at it.</p><p> But as with many skills, practice does not make perfect, practice makes permanent, and thus bad communication habits form. </p><p> Today we listen to respond, and mostly half listen. We are so focused on anything else, but rarely are we listening.  We need to make eye contact, watch a person&rsquo;s facial movement, and listen with more than our ears.  We need to block out and silence the mind in order to really hear. </p><p> Here are five things you can do to become a better listener.  If you do these things you will be a better business owner, employee, spouse, parent and well just a better person in general.</p><p> <strong>  1. When someone is talking put down anything you have in your hands. </strong>   Yes, this includes your phone or anything you might fidget with. </p><p> <strong>  2. Make real and genuine eye contact. </strong>   If you think about listening with your eyes, they will soften and the person communicating with you will realize you are being genuine and you care about what they are saying. </p><p> <strong>  3. Watch their face. </strong>   Grimaces, eye movement, and other facial expressions can and do say as much as the words are. </p><p> <strong>  4. Listen to their pace, tone, and tenor.  </strong> Are they speeding up, slowing down, getting louder or softer?

When you review your client list and see a number of clients who are lawyers or doctors or entrepreneurs that means you&rsquo;ve found a way to attract these people. So extend your influence to include others in that group. In fact any demographic based selection will work. Say you have a lot of successful older female clients that you connect with and enjoy working with, you can build a strategy to grow your practice with older women.<strong> This targeted approach works for two reasons:</strong>First, you&rsquo;re already knowledgeable about the needs of people in that group so there is less of a learning curve for you and prospects will immediately recognize that you understand the specific needs and issues they face as lawyers/accountants/entrepreneurs/women.Second, most well defined groups have associations, events, publications, even informal groups such as clubs that you can easily reach out to.<h3> Take away</h3>Prospecting is hard work: It requires a sales mindset and a commitment (<a href=\"/sell/marketing-to-women/to-grow-your-business-youre-going-to-have-to-do-lot-more-than-be-great-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Step 1</a>), a targeted approach makes it easier (step 2), as does connecting with people in the group around their interests (Step 3).Look for more in the next blog when we discuss how connecting with people through what interests them.Learn how to<b> Retain Female Clients</b>through this online course and earn CE credits.

How to Get to the Next Level of Greatness","link":"what-stories-are-you-telling-yourself-how-to-get-to-the-next-level-of-greatness","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;Our minds influence the key activity of the brain, which then influences everything; perception, cognition, thoughts and feelings, personal relationships; they&rsquo;re all a projection of you.&rdquo; &mdash; Deepak Chopra <br/>  </h3><p> So here you are; you have come so far. But, is this where you are going to stop? Or, are you ready to reach the next level of greatness? As you start out on your journey, here are five questions to ask yourself.</p><h3> Who are you? <br/>  </h3><p> Not the &lsquo;who&rsquo; that everyone has been telling you to be, but the &lsquo;who&rsquo; you were before you started believing them. Who were you when you were a child, young and naive? Who are you when you are alone with your thoughts, where no one can see or hear you? If you want to get to the next level of greatness, you have to find who you are at your very core.</p><h3> What stories are you telling yourself? <br/>  </h3><p> Are they the same stories that you tell the world? Where did they come from? When did they start? Who first told them to you? And, most important, are they true? The stories that you tell yourself will either propel you to the next level of greatness or serve as an anchor around your neck that will sink you. Make sure you are telling yourself the right stories. Word of warning here, don&rsquo;t lie to yourself; find positive, inspiring, powerful stories that are true.</p><h3> What are your strengths? <br/>  </h3><p> While it&rsquo;s good to minimize your weaknesses, your energy is much better spent on building on your strengths. What can you do to become even stronger? Can you become a subject matter expert, the go to person in your area of strength? If you want to reach the next level of greatness you can&rsquo;t be a jack-of-all-trades; identify your strengths and run with them.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> What are your goals? <br/>  </h3><p> You can&rsquo;t reach the next level of greatness by wandering lost in the woods. Get realistic about where you are and then visualize what that next level looks like. What does it feel like? Now, set some goals to get you from here to there. Not giant, overwhelming goals; set small incremental goals that serve as stepping stones.</p><h3> Who do you need to become? <br/>  </h3><p> The answer to this question holds the key to all success. The person that got you here can&rsquo;t get you to the next level of greatness. So, what kind of individual would be able to attain that level? What would they know? How would they act? Who would they spend their time with? What habits would they have? Well, if you want to get to the next level, you&rsquo;re going to have to become that person. So, get busy.</p><h3> The Key <br/>  </h3><p> You hold the key to getting to the next level of greatness. It&rsquo;s inside of you right now. You&rsquo;re going to have to do some deep, sometimes uncomfortable soul searching to figure out who you really are. Then, you are going to have to unravel years&rsquo; worth of stories to get to the bottom of where they came from and if they are even true. You are going to have to start telling yourself new, powerful, and positive stories. You&rsquo;re going to have to dig down and identify your true strengths and then pursue these strengths rather than fretting over your weaknesses.</p><p> You&rsquo;re going to have to figure out how you are going to get from here to there and set some goals to keep yourself on track. And finally, you MUST figure out who you need to become in order to reach the next level of greatness. Now for the catch, answering all of these questions, no matter how deep you dig and how honest you are with yourself will get you nowhere without action.</p><p> So, get out there and get going!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-07 15:33:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-07 15:33:17.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_539GMC8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-stories-are-you-telling-yourself-how-to-get-to-the-next-level-of-greatness/\", \"post_id\": \"12319\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-07 15:33:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-07 15:33:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-stories-are-you-telling-yourself-how-to-get-to-the-next-level-of-greatness\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12318\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5983\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-Stories-Are-You-Telling-Yourself-How-to-Get-to-the-Next-Level-of-Greatness.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"869\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467975600,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5746,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Lessons I Learned About Failure as an FBI Agent","link":"10-lessons-i-learned-about-failure-as-an-fbi-agent","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> About halfway through the FBI Academy I learned that climbing a 20-foot rope was a physical requirement for new agents. The problem was everyone else in my class could do it&mdash;except me. <br/>  </h3><p> People who are physically strong are born knowing how to bend their bodies to perform unnatural acts while others, like me, find anything more than hunching over a book an unnatural contortion.</p><p> Day after day, time and time again, I&rsquo;d get about one-third of the way up and just couldn&rsquo;t pull myself up any further. I was fatigued, and at some point, avoiding rope burn became as much of a goal as climbing because I needed to get down safely.</p><p> It was humiliating to know that I needed to prepare for failure on each climb as well as prepare for eventual success. But this was the thing: over time I realized that the same skills I needed to prepare for failure would also be needed if I succeeded because I still had to get back down the rope.</p><p> Trust me when I say that retreating day after day was harder than moving ahead. I needed to think long-term as well as short-term. On one occasion I thought I might make it to the top if I really pushed, but how would I get down&mdash;with dignity and without injury?</p><p> Success meant climbing the rope. So I kept at it. Athletes get psyched up before games and competition because this is where the real battle lines are drawn&mdash;in the mind. I knew if I began to doubt whether or not I&rsquo;d ever be able to climb the rope, I wouldn&rsquo;t. I needed to keep my mind strong by optimism and positive thinking.</p><p> The difference between successful people and those who are not is not a matter of how often they fail. Instead, it is a matter of how many times they try. Successful people fail just as often, perhaps more so because they keep picking themselves up again and again. They keep trying new things until at last they find something that works. They push past the negative attitudes and depression that comes with failure.</p><p> Samuel Becket asked a brilliant question: &ldquo;How can we fail better?&rdquo;</p><p> Why are some people more resilient? Why is it that the same set of circumstances that drives one person deeper into the mud makes another stronger? Failure is one of life&rsquo;s most common traumas, yet people&rsquo;s responses to it vary widely. Some bounce back after a brief period of malaise; other continue to descent into depression and a fear of the future.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Thomas Edison threw himself into his work. While he was trying to invent the light bulb, he failed over 10,000 times. He worked long hours but his persistence and resilience led to the creation of the incandescent light bulb. Edison did not look at these 10,000 attempts as failures; rather, he saw them as 10,000 lesson about how not to make a light bulb.</p><p> I found that overcoming failure is as much about being motivated as it is about having the right talent. It is important to focus on the right things. I eventually did climb the rope and get back down without burn marks by getting out every day and believing that I would attain my goal.</p><h3> Here are 10 lessons I learned about failure: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1) Start <br/>  </h3><p> I kept putting off climbing the rope, even after I knew I&rsquo;d need to do it. There is no better way to overcome the fear of failure than to start moving toward your goal. Stop thinking about how hard the task is going to be or how long it will take you. Just start. Not starting is failure.</p><h3> 2) Stay positive <br/>  </h3><p> This means finding and using a positive attitude about the task or goal. Positive thinking can be powerful. You have the choice to replace negative attitudes with positive ones. Your thinking will help you consider your goal not just a possibility, but a probability. Remember that everyone who has achieved greatness has had to overcome obstacles. Think back to some of the barriers that you have overcome in your life. Use positive language with yourself and speak in phrases like &ldquo;I want,&rdquo; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I like.&rdquo; See what effect it has and persist in positive thinking until you feel better about what you need to accomplish to move forward.</p><h3> 3) Celebrate success <br/>  </h3><p> Your current successes need to be celebrated; your past ones need to be remembered. They can be a powerful motivator when faced with failure in the future.</p><h3> 4) Establish a benchmark test for choosing friends <br/>  </h3><p> Ask yourself whether spending time with this person will lift you up or drag you down? Will spending time with this person help you to become your best self? Will you be happier after spending time with this person? Will this person help you achieve your most important goals? If not, find friends who will.</p><h3> 5) Find a friendly competitor <br/>  </h3><p> Find a co-worker or friend with similar goals. Make sure the person is someone who will bring out the competitive spirit in you. If possible, find someone in whom you can also confide your goals. Hold each other accountable.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 6) Visualize <br/>  </h3><p> Imagine how events will unfold. See yourself winning or achieving your goal. Hear yourself being positive about the challenge before you. Form a clear mental picture and do it several times a day. It&rsquo;s an effective way to get you into a positive frame of mind. You might also find images that represent your goal and use them as screen savers, wallpaper, or post them somewhere you&rsquo;ll see them regularly.</p><h3> 7) Learn from past experiences <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t be afraid look at your past performances and mistakes as part of the growth process. Just because an endeavor has not ended as well as you had hoped it would, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t learn from them. Defeat is only a temporary condition; giving up is what makes it permanent. Keep moving forward. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I&rsquo;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times I&rsquo;ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I&rsquo;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.&rdquo; Michael Jordan.</p><h3> 8) Breakdown your goals <br/>  </h3><p> Set goals that inspire you, even if they seem slightly out of reach. If you set goals that are too easy to attain, you&rsquo;ll never reach your full potential. It will be more productive if you break down your goals into realistic tasks that you can track. Use the strategy of small steps and take small bites at a time. Break down the larger task into mini goals. It&rsquo;s easier to achieve the next step.</p><h3> 9) Talk it up <br/>  </h3><p> Tell people what you&rsquo;re doing to keep the conversation around you animated and supportive. Tell them you&rsquo;re going to achieve your goal by a deadline. It will help hold you accountable to your timeframe. Keep talking about it and give friends and family frequent updates. No one wants to be embarrassed because they don&rsquo;t have the willpower to achieve goals they&rsquo;ve announced to the world.</p><h3> 10) Focus <br/>  </h3><p> Spend a little time every day working on your goal. It will make it easier if the goal is a desire of your heart and not just another task. Take time to focus on something you really want to do. Break up your routine tasks with something that is meaningful to you.</p><p> The real battle between success and failure is played in the mind.

{"original_id":5747,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Questions for Your Coaching Toolbox to Get Big Results","link":"7-questions-for-your-coaching-toolbox-to-get-big-results","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Coaching is one of the most powerful leadership and sales tools.</p><p> It can be tempting to dismiss it as time-consuming or handholding, but both of those assumptions are mistaken. In his book, The Coaching Habit, Michael Bungay Stanier gives busy leaders advice on how to coach effectively.</p><p> In ten minutes or less, you can ask strategic and thought-provoking questions that can help drive beneficial changes in behavior, help build team cohesiveness, and get things done effectively.</p><h3> Here are his seven questions to add to your coaching toolbox to make your life easier and get big results. <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. The Kick Start Question <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo;</p><p> This question jumps right to the heart of the matter without assuming you already know the answer. It gives your associate a chance to voice the thing that is most pressing for them.</p><p> You may already have a good idea of what they are struggling with, but by asking this question, you&rsquo;ll know what the real focus of your conversation should be.</p><h3> 2. A.W.E. Question <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo;</p><p> Stanier calls this the best coaching question in the world because it can supercharge any conversation. It&rsquo;s a follow up that forces the other person to think deeper about the issue at hand. Often the first response that comes to mind isn&rsquo;t the only answer or even the best answer.</p><p> As a leader, your first inclination is to fix problems, but this question also works as a great self-management tool. It forces you to slow down and really think about what the person is saying before rushing to give advice.</p><h3> 3. Focus Question <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the real challenge here for you?&rdquo;</p><p> As mentioned with the A.W.E. question, the first response someone gives may not be the most relevant. Similarly, the first issue that comes up in a coaching session might not be the real problem at hand.</p><p> This question helps nail down the actual problem, and those two little words at the end &ldquo;for you&rdquo; help steer towards a more personal conversation. This leads to a more developmental coaching session rather a performance-based one, which can save time on having to do less coaching down the road.</p><h3> 4. Foundation Question <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p><p> Sometimes this is actually a difficult question to answer, but asking this is a great way to get deeper into the conversation more quickly. It can be particularly powerful if the conversation seems to have been derailed by frustration or other negative emotions.</p><p> As with many of these questions, it also works as a self-management tool. If you&rsquo;re feeling a little lost, asking yourself what it is that you want out of this conversation can help you get back on track.</p><h3> 5. Lazy Question <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What do you want from me?&rdquo;</p><p> Being lazy is rarely a recommended course of action in the business world, but here, it&rsquo;s sound advice. Doing work that isn&rsquo;t yours to handle wastes your time and doesn&rsquo;t help the other person grow.</p><p> Instead of assuming you know what the other person needs from you, just ask. By asking either of these questions, you can get a clear request for what you can do without taking ownership away from them.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 6. Strategic Question <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;If you say yes to this, what must you say no to?&rdquo;</p><p> Strategy is often about saying no to things that you really want to say yes to. It&rsquo;s about making decisions by looking at what has to be sacrificed for the choice you ultimately make.</p><p> Tough choices are something you and your associates have to learn how to deal with. It&rsquo;s important when making these choices to know exactly what the decision involves.</p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to assume that you already know the answers, but when you think about it in terms of &ldquo;what do I have to give up by making this choice?&rdquo; it can put things in sharper perspective.</p><h3> 7. Learning Question <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;What was most useful or most valuable here for you?&rdquo;</p><p> This question makes people stop and reflect, and this is extremely important for the learning process. Neural connections aren&rsquo;t made when people are being told what to do, or even when they&rsquo;re doing something; they&rsquo;re made during the reflection process.</p><p> This question also provides you with feedback on which coaching approaches work and which could use some tweaking.</p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> Most of these questions can be used well beyond 1-on-1 coaching. You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to memorize them as a script to read off in this order, just pick out whichever one is most useful to you in your situation.</p><p> However you use them, these seven questions can help get more out of your conversations to build up and promote the development of your team, and thus, the company as a whole.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-07 16:01:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-07 16:01:04.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_gfQ7Di4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-questions-for-your-coaching-toolbox-to-get-big-results/\", \"post_id\": \"12323\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-07 16:01:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-07 16:01:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-questions-for-your-coaching-toolbox-to-get-big-results\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12322\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5985\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/7-Questions-for-Your-Coaching-Toolbox-to-Get-Big-Results.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"910\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468000800,"author_id":208,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5748,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Businesses Can Learn From Amazon to Be More Competitive","link":"what-businesses-can-learn-from-amazon-to-be-more-competitive","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> What is one of the most valuable commodities in the world? Time! <br/>  </h3><p> There is an old saying that goes something like this: &ldquo;If you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door.&rdquo; This is often attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson and the concept of a better mousetrap is a great metaphor for a reason to continuously innovate.</p><p> In a competitive business world, price, selection, customer service and innovation are major reasons customers might choose one company over another. We can now add another concept to the mix, and that is convenience. (And, by the way, the reason I included innovation to my mix of competitive reasons is that it takes innovation to create convenience.)</p><p> Many will argue that convenience is part of customer service or the customer experience. I&rsquo;ll agree with that, but it is becoming so important, that I&rsquo;m willing to separate it out. There are businesses that use convenience as their sole competitive differentiator.</p><p> There is a reason that convenience stores are called convenience stores. Think about it. They are smaller than other retailers that carry similar items. They aren&rsquo;t necessarily the lowest price. Yet, somehow they don&rsquo;t just survive against their larger competitors. They thrive. Why? Because they are convenient. They are in the neighborhood. They are on the way to or from work or on the right side of the street. They aren&rsquo;t as crowded, so a customer can get in and out much quicker. For what they lack in the selection of merchandise, they make up for in convenience.</p><p> If you want to learn about how a company competes on convenience, take a look at one of the biggest companies on the planet, Amazon. They are a case study for convenience.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> When you think of Amazon, you might think of low prices and big selection. I can name dozens of other companies, both online and brick-and-mortar that do the same thing. Amazon knows it competes with all retailers. So, they broke out of the low price and big selection game with convenience. They want to save time and make life easier for their customers. They created the Amazon Prime program that gets merchandise shipped to you, without shipping charges, in two days or less. They created the Dash button that allows you to purchase merchandise with the simple push of a button. They want to eliminate as many steps as possible from the time a customer is thinking about purchasing a product until that product is delivered. And, now they are setting up distribution centers throughout major cities that can get merchandise to you in two hours or less. Speed and simplicity is what they are about.</p><p> So, regardless of the type of business you&rsquo;re in, how can you create convenience for your customers? What would your customers define as convenience? Figure that out and you have another competitive strategy that will take you and your business to the next level.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-07 16:22:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-07 16:22:18.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_vyHiLyI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-businesses-can-learn-from-amazon-to-be-more-competitive/\", \"post_id\": \"12325\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-07 16:22:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-07 16:22:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-businesses-can-learn-from-amazon-to-be-more-competitive\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12324\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5986\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-Businesses-Can-Learn-From-Amazon-to-Be-More-Competitive.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"578\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467993600,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5749,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Dangers and Damage If Employees Don't Take Time Off","link":"the-dangers-and-damage-if-employees-dont-take-time-off","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> If you say you&rsquo;ve never been stressed at work, you&rsquo;re probably lying. <br/>  </h3><p> Everyone everywhere has had those days, weeks, or &mdash; gulp &mdash; months in their jobs that turn them into a harried bundle of stress. It&rsquo;s why the term &ldquo;mental health day&rdquo; was coined. And yet, despite the term, employees aren&rsquo;t taking advantage of time off.</p><p> According to the US Chamber of Commerce:</p><li> 4 in 10 American workers allow some of their paid vacation days to go unused and expire</li><li> An average of 3.2 hours of PTO go unused by an American worker every year </li><li> However, 96% of workers claim to see the virtue in taking time off </li><p> We all know these workers &mdash; and frankly, it&rsquo;s statistically likely that we&rsquo;ve all  been  these workers. The ones with what the US Chamber of Commerce calls the &ldquo;work martyr complex&rdquo;: employees who believe if they took a day off, the job would completely fall apart. Many others feel that work has piled up so high, they couldn&rsquo;t spare the time or their boss won&rsquo;t support it.</p><p> While the responsibility for taking PTO falls to the workers themselves, managers must be accountable for combating the work martyr complex that makes it so difficult. A good leader must make it a priority to ensure employees feel comfortable taking time off.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s at Stake? <br/>  </h3><p> The work martyr&rsquo;s fears are not just unfounded, they are the exact opposite of reality.</p><p> The US Chamber of Commerce study found that 90% of business leaders thought that employees who use PTO are more ready to work efficiently and productively. And this belief is borne out by research. Take a look at these findings from The Whitehall II Study and Ernst &amp; Young that show the dangers of overworking:</p><li> For each additional 10 hours of vacation employees took, their performance reviews from supervisors were 8% higher the following year</li><li> Subjects who worked more than 55 hours per week had poor cognitive function when compared to those who worked 35&ndash;40 hours</li><p> The US Chamber of Commerce also found that 90% of leaders said that using PTO cut down on sick days and boosted office morale. And every manager knows how important morale is to employee engagement and retention &mdash; a.k.a. your bottom line.</p><p> Employees agree. Despite not taking their PTO, 74% of employees in companies that encourage using PTO report being either &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; or &ldquo;very happy&rdquo; in their personal lives. Taking PTO also boosts their workplace happiness and makes employees more likely to be very happy with their professional success and financial situation.</p><p> Managers and employees are on the same page: taking time off is beneficial to both personal and professional success. It helps workers stick around on the job while also boosting the quality of their work.</p><h3> Be the Kind of Boss Who Makes Your Employees Leave <br/>  </h3><p> So what does all this mean for managers, and how does it fit in with being a good leader?</p><p> The Center for Creative Leadership conducted a survey on leadership qualities. Two of the ones at the top are &ldquo;team-oriented&rdquo; and &ldquo;humane-oriented.&rdquo; And a humane, team-oriented manager cares about the morale of their employees. Rather than pushing them to churn out work all year long, this manager is more likely to suggest they take a week or two off.</p><p> Letting employees go on vacation &mdash; what&rsquo;s more, encouraging them &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t make a manager &ldquo;weak&rdquo; or &ldquo;soft.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t say no to your workers. It makes you a better leader.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Change the Meaning of Teamwork <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s a false sense of being team-oriented that many workers fall prey to. They won&rsquo;t take time off because they think that their work will fall on already busy coworkers, that they&rsquo;ll be letting their team down.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the manager&rsquo;s job to redefine what &ldquo;team-oriented&rdquo; really means. And it doesn&rsquo;t mean insinuating that taking time off hangs coworkers out to dry.</p><p> Instead, managers should reinforce team leadership with their actions:</p><li> Help employees work together to resolve conflict</li><li> Support collaboration for completing projects</li><li> Find cohesion among groups in the office</li><p> Team meetings shouldn&rsquo;t just be about work, work, work. Ensure there&rsquo;s time at the beginning or end to talk about how people in the group are doing personally at work, and find ways for coworkers to help support each other. It shows that they&rsquo;re important to the team for more than just the hours they put in at the office.</p><p> Help team members see that taking PTO boosts productivity and morale &mdash; a far more beneficial thing for the group in the long run.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Bottom Line: Just Be More Humane <br/>  </h3><p> Managers should be compassionate, helpful, and generous with their employees &mdash; both professionally and personally. If a top-performing employee has suffered an illness or a family crisis, though it honestly may put you in a bind, show empathy and understanding. Give them the space to take care of themselves without worrying about rushing back to the office. Making that employee feel like they are sacrificing too much for their job will be much worse in the long run than allowing them to take the time now.</p><p> The same goes for overworked employees. Constantly reach out to your workers to check in on their happiness and satisfaction in their job roles. Listen. Engage. Though it may seem like common sense, your employees are people, too, not just cogs in a machine, and too often many feel they can&rsquo;t take time off just because they are feeling stressed. Sincere concern from their boss might make the difference between a burnt out employee and one who takes the time off they need &mdash; and comes back rejuvenated.</p><p> Employees not taking their PTO might not be an issue on your radar as a manager.

The fish in a sea are as important as the predators. They keep the circle of life in balance. Our human society is not that different from natural ecosystems.</p><p> In order to survive as an apex &lsquo;predator&rsquo; one needs to understand the workings of an ecosystem, without misinterpreting the connection of &lsquo;large&rsquo; and &lsquo;success&rsquo;.</p><p> It is not the survival of the biggest, but the survival of the fittest. Successful organisations of the future are not by definition large, but they are capable of managing an extensive network of people and businesses, with only one purpose: customer centricity. What does this mean? How do businesses acquire the skills that are needed to build and maintain a business ecosystem and make sure they thrive in it?</p><h3> Success is not measured on the days when the sun shines. Success is measured on the dark, stormy, cloudy days. And if you can&rsquo;t absorb failure, you&rsquo;re never going to meet success.&rdquo; &ndash; Robert Herjavec (Shark Tank) <br/>  </h3><p> It is all about having the adaptive power to anticipate what is coming, and that is mostly change. Creating value in a continuously changing environment is crucial. Not only changes that derive from innovation, technology and the economy, but also change as a consequence of failures will define your company&rsquo;s role within an ecosystem.</p><h3> How to chart your course in an ecosystem <br/>  </h3><p> When you want to create or join a flourishing business ecosystem, what are your basic principles? What do you need to do?</p><h3> <strong>  1) Define </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Define your company&rsquo;s purpose. The &lsquo;why&rsquo;, what is your story?. The more this purpose is tied to solving a societal problem, the more engaged employees, partners, suppliers and customers will feel. Communicate your story clearly on all levels. It is the crucial step that should lead the way to your company&rsquo;s mission and vision (and not the other way around!).</p><h3> <strong>  2) Understand </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> It is important that you understand the ecosystem and how the organisations in it interact. Your network is your key currency. How your network will introduce you to interesting parties is determines your likeability factor. Who you are is considerably influenced by who you know. Knowing the right people is what will give you the competitive advantage in business. Put it out there. Exposing that network publically will boost your position. Networks like LinkedIn Twitter, Facebook and Google give you the opportunity to establish credibility and influence to open doors that can help you thrive. Before you create this exposure for your business, you need to understand your own value creation in relation to the ecosystem. Ask yourself, &ldquo;Am I prepared to evolve not only in the ecosystem but also as an organisation?&rdquo;.</p><h3> <strong>  3) Follow </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Follow the money. I know it sounds capitalistic, but decision making should be based on revenues. Only with investment money, you can make money and contribute to society. Follow the talent; to optimise the synergy of your network, it is important that you gather the right set of skills. Last but certainly not least: follow your instinct! When you use these three building stones, you need to developed your survival strategy along the way that will simultaneously define your role in the ecosystem. You can be the shark and, as the biggest fish in the sea, dominantly stipulate your conditions for success. Or maybe you function better as fish within a large school that hides among others in order to operate inconspicuous but effectively. Sometimes you need to be the parasite and hitch a ride on someone else&rsquo;s fin in order to survive. And there are always opportunities for the diverse or dangerous species, so you might find out that you thrash about as a flying fish or a poisonous fish. Pick the role and strategy that helps you become valuable in your ecosystem, that are in line with your strengths. This might not always be the role you had dreamed of. But to make this circle round again: to successfully live with each other in an business ecosystem, every member should always focus on the &lsquo;why&rsquo; (purpose) instead of on the &lsquo;how&rsquo;, so roles are harmoniously balanced and all members in it can benefit from a healthy ecosystem.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Take your entrepreneurship further <br/>  </h3><p> What more will empower your social entrepreneurship? They say luck is something you create. You can. Always be on the lookout for chances and opportunities, whether you are a shark or a flying fish. Regardless of the role you play within an business ecosystem, when you are on the move all the time and keep looking around, opportunities will knock on your door a lot of times. Do not only count the successes that derive from them, also your failures. Your survival depend on the way you deal with both valuable moments.

I&rsquo;ve made some good hires and some not so good hires along the way &ndash; nothing crazy, but not awesome either. It occurred to me recently that nobody ever really taught me to be a good interviewer. Do you have some tips you can share to help me improve my interview skills? <br/>  </h3><p> A &ndash; Interviewing is one of those weird things in our careers where it seems like we&rsquo;re just supposed to know how to do it. We&rsquo;re meant to pick it up by osmosis. Like if we interview enough for our own jobs, we&rsquo;ll somehow learn to be good at discovering and recruiting talent. Some companies, especially the bigger ones, have programs in place for managers to become stronger interviewers, but even these rarely scratch the surface of what it takes to actually be able to distinguish a great candidate from a good one.</p><p> It&rsquo;s actually getting tougher for hiring managers because there is so much information out and so many tools (like the ones I give away J) designed to give candidates an edge. This leg up doesn&rsquo;t discriminate either &ndash; all candidates benefit &ndash; bad ones and good ones. It&rsquo;s gotten incredibly easy to do research on people and companies, and to study common interview questions and download free interview tools. When used correctly, you can create the illusion you have more expertise than you actually do. Unfortunately, as the interviewees have gotten stronger, the interviewers have not. The outcome, as you&rsquo;ve experienced, is that it&rsquo;s tougher than ever to consistently identify great people.</p><p> To be perfectly fair, I was a terrible interviewer until pretty recently. And there&rsquo;s a decent chance some of you have even been interviewed by me and weren&rsquo;t all that impressed. The truth is, like many of you, for the longest time I don&rsquo;t think I really had a clear picture of why I was doing certain things in my interviews &ndash; I just kinda did them.</p><li> My questions were very random and had no clear purpose.</li><li> I actually didn&rsquo;t really listen to most answers very closely.</li><li> I rarely probed past the first response to a question.</li><li> I often talked more than the candidate during the interview.</li><li> Sometimes I was tough and other times I was easy without knowing why.</li><p> The impact of this ill-conceived interview approach was that I ended up relying solely on intuition and feel to select candidates. My interview process was so weak it didn&rsquo;t actually add any value in identifying the best person for the job so I&rsquo;d just go on gut feel. Sure, the charade of interviewing was there but I wasn&rsquo;t really doing anything with purpose. And while I think your instinct about a person has value, it can&rsquo;t be the only thing you go on. In my experience, the best you can really hope to do when hiring by feel alone, is a 60-70% success rate and that&rsquo;s not good enough.</p><p> Unfortunately, there is no way I can give a full course on interviewing in one newsletter edition, but I can share five core principles that outline my approach to the matter. My hope is that these fundamentals can help you get off to a good start if you&rsquo;re new to interviewing or tighten up your game if you&rsquo;ve been doing it for a while.</p><h3> Here are my 5 core interview principles that help me discover and recruit great people. <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Always Make the Candidate as Comfortable as Possible <br/>  </h3><p> The temptation is going to be to gloss over this one. But it&rsquo;s my number one tip for a reason. As you know, having interviewed for jobs yourself, the interview process is a nerve wracking affair. And for many people &ndash; talented people &ndash; it can be a serious source of anxiety. This is why I try to make people as comfortable as I possibly can at the very beginning of the interview. I want to set them at ease. I purposefully make things as easy and relaxed and friendly as possible. If I didn&rsquo;t do this, if I contributed to the anxiety and nervousness of the candidate by being cold or tough or abrupt, I&rsquo;d effectively be eliminating a significant portion of potentially great candidates who are supremely talented but don&rsquo;t perform their best when uncomfortable. I want to see people at their absolute best &ndash; not at their most nervous &ndash; because that&rsquo;s not representative of an actual work environment on a day to day basis. You might counter that with, &ldquo;well don&rsquo;t you want to see how they perform under pressure?&rdquo; and I would argue, not really. I am mostly concerned with seeing a candidate&rsquo;s full potential. That&rsquo;s what tells me if I want to make an investment in them or not. It&rsquo;s important to be clear the goal is not to discover the best interviewer, it&rsquo;s to find the person who is going to be best when the job is at hand.</p><p> My recommendation to interviewers is to go out of your way to make candidates as comfortable as you can. Be extremely friendly, start with easier questions, help them settle it, and smile a lot. I think you&rsquo;ll discover by doing this, the average quality of candidates you interview will magically go up just by you helping them be at their best instead of at their worst.</p><h3> 2. Always be Selling the Job <br/>  </h3><p> For similar reasons, I want every candidate to covet the job I&rsquo;m hiring for. Good candidates, bad candidates, average candidates, I try to sell everyone on how great the job is. There are two reasons I do this and the first one is I want to create an environment where candidates will go the extra mile to get hired. I want to see their absolute best effort. If you can make a job seem attractive enough (without lying of course), you will get a chance to see the maximum potential in every candidate. It&rsquo;s a really great way to gauge what a person can do when they have the right motivation.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The other reason I sell the job to everyone is that its super competitive out there to hire the best people. In many fields, the best candidates have two or three competing offers and I want to make sure my job is the most attractive to them. I see way too many managers conducting interviews as though they (the company) have all the power and that the candidate is the only one auditioning for the role. The only time that is true is when the candidate is weak. Acting like this is a really good way to ensure you end up recruiting a mediocre team.</p><p> My recommendation for hiring managers is to spend time in every interview, whether the candidate seems great or not, selling them on how attractive the opportunity is. For those of you wondering why you&rsquo;d do this for below average candidates, my answer is, why not? There is zero downside to taking this approach. In the worst case scenario, you&rsquo;re bolstering the reputation of your company and your team by having one more person thinking highly of you. As an interviewer, you goal should be to have every single person leaving the interview desperately wanting to land the job.</p><h3> 3. Talk Less <br/>  </h3><p> I won&rsquo;t spend a ton of time on this one but I&rsquo;ve sat through enough interviews where the hiring manager dominates the conversation to know it&rsquo;s a problem.  For the love of god, stop talking so much. I was definitely a culprit of this early in my career and it&rsquo;s a really bad habit. If you&rsquo;re talking any more than 30% of the duration of the interview, you need to stop. The primary goal of an interview is to understand the candidate, not to hear yourself speak. The best interviews (on both sides) feel like conversations where the interviewer is clearly interested in what the candidate has to say. That&rsquo;s just not possible if you&rsquo;re the one doing all the talking.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4. Always Ask One More Question <br/>  </h3><p> One great way to keep a conversation flowing and to test the depth in candidates is to automatically ask one follow on or probing question after every answer a candidate gives. Incidentally, it&rsquo;s also a great way to ensure you&rsquo;re only talking 30% of the time since you effectively pass the microphone back for more depth on every question. Early in my career, I&rsquo;d just run through a list of questions I found on the internet and then try to figure out who I liked the best based on their answers. But I almost always accepted the first answer at face value. I&rsquo;ve since learned that all the gold &ndash; what differentiates good candidates from great ones &ndash; lives in the next level down.</p><p> How will they react to a request for more depth?</p><p> What will they say if I challenge something in their answer?</p><p> Can they evaluate another perspective?</p><p> You can only get to that highly valuable insight if you press a little deeper after each question.</p><p> My recommendation to hiring managers is to automatically ask a follow-up for each question posed. I don&rsquo;t pick and choose the spots I do this; I just do it every time. And it&rsquo;s far less important how you ask follow up questions and more that you just get the candidate off their prepared script and basic research and giving greater visibility into how they really think. Here are some examples:</p><p> You mentioned the importance of performance metrics, is there ever a time when measuring performance isn&rsquo;t important?</p><p> You talked about being a self-starter. That&rsquo;s a great gift to have but tell me about the process you go through to ensure you start quickly and deliver with quality in the end.</p><p> It&rsquo;s great to hear you&rsquo;re passionate about the discipline of marketing. What companies do you think are doing the best marketing in the world right now and walk me through why you think that is the case.</p><p> If you start adding a follow-up probe to every question you ask, I think you&rsquo;ll start finding it easier to differentiate average candidates from awesome ones.</p><h3> 5. Test for Approach vs. Facts <br/>  </h3><p> The internet has just made it too easy to prepare for interviews. As a hiring manager, you need to go much further in how you&rsquo;re testing candidates. 15 years ago it may have been impressive that a prospective hire knew about you and your company and the market, but now that&rsquo;s a 5-minute google search. For this reason, almost all of my standard interview questions are designed to help me understand how a candidate thinks vs. test what they know. For some of you, this might seem obvious but I still don&rsquo;t see it being employed enough in practice.</p><p> It&rsquo;s one thing to nod your head at the importance of testing for approach vs. rote knowledge and a very different thing entirely to execute it in the interview. One thing I see a lot of hiring managers do these days is assign homework to late stage candidates. Build a plan or design a strategy or something like that. And while this can be moderately effective, it still doesn&rsquo;t really give you a window into how the candidate approaches a problem at the most fundamental level. It&rsquo;s just too easy to download a template or get a friend to help with an assignment.</p><p> My recommendation for hiring managers is to spend most of your energy getting the candidate to explain how they would go about attacking a problem vs. solving the problem itself. Here are a few example questions I might use:</p><p> Imagine we have a new product coming out and our goal is to get it into the hands of 1000 small businesses in the US and Canada. What would be your approach to make that happen?</p><p> In this job you&rsquo;re going to be managing a pretty big team where the team members work closely with people from many departments. Inevitably situations are going to arise where you hear complaints about the performance of someone on your team. Walk me through how you would you deal with that?</p><p> It&rsquo;s very likely when you start your new job, there will be more work than you can handle. There will be many competing priorities and only one of you. Walk me through how you would manage a situation where demands on your time exceed your capacity.</p><p> Unfortunately for many of us, interview training is not readily available. But as we progress in our careers as managers, it quickly becomes one of the most important skills to be successful. And while learning to be a great interviewer takes a lot of time and practice, I hope, at the very least, these core principles I use will be helpful to you and offer a perspective you can build on.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-07 16:33:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-07 16:33:29.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_rYGca60.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-know-these-core-interview-principles-to-recruit-great-people/\", \"post_id\": \"12331\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-07 16:33:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-07 16:33:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-know-these-core-interview-principles-to-recruit-great-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12330\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5989\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Do-You-Know-These-Core-Interview-Principles-to-Recruit-Great-People.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"647\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467979200,"author_id":74,"chart_url":""}

And if you are the hero of most of the stories, you will lose the power of storytelling and most of the opportunities to connect with people.

In his books, he describes the struggles and ultimate revelation and conversion of mythical managers and CEOs who have encountered barriers and obstacles.

One of the reasons is because the reader or listener identifies with the hero. On one level we want to root for the good guy. We want Skywalker to triumph over Vader. We want Rocky to win the fight. We want Erin Brockovich to beat the utility company. Even when the hero is not exactly pure we want them to win. We side with Jason Bourne, a trained killer, in his fight against the government. We want James Bond to defeat, well, everybody.</p><p> We want them to win because we see something of us in them. The causes. The values. Lencioni brings it closer to home. We who manage or own companies put ourselves in the place of the protagonist. We are engaged by the story because it is about us. We have dysfunctions on our teams. We have been sentenced to death by meeting. We want the hero to win because it is how we win.</p><p> And when storytelling is effective in communicating your value to your client it is because the client sees their own struggle in the journey of your story. Let me tell you about one woman who came to us after losing her husband. Here is how we helped one person recently who did not know how to evaluate the early retirement offer he got from his employer. One family we met recently really struggled with how much to leave their kids for fear it would cause them more damage than good.</p><p> Stories are critical in communicating your value proposition and your differentiator. Effectively written, your story will prompt a prospective client to say &ldquo;Yes! That&rsquo;s exactly the problem I am trying to overcome. That&rsquo;s the outcome I was looking for. I want what she had.&rdquo; And that is only possible when your client is the hero.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> In a good story, the hero goes through a transformation. Overcomes an obstacle. Develops a skill. Simba faces the memory of Mufasa&rsquo;s death and returns to save the kingdom. Similarly, our client develops a vision for retirement and overcomes their worry and confusion, successfully structures their income to minimize tax, figures out how to benefit a cause without compromising their financial well-being. Maybe not as dramatic as ejecting the hyenas and restoring the fertile plains of Africa but meaningful to our clients.</p><p> And this is where some of the advisors we work with have missed the opportunity. They believed that they should be the hero.</p><p> It makes sense that you see yourself coming to the rescue of the client but it is not what will capture their attention or persuade. Most clients want guidance. They want to be advised, not saved. And so they respond to that story of the person facing the decisions and challenges and envision themselves transforming into the successful retiree, parent, business owner, or philanthropist.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Every hero needs a guide, a coach, a Sherpa. And that is the role you can play. Be Yoda and let the client be Skywalker. Be D-Bob and let your client be Rudy. Tell a story that enables your prospective client to say &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s who I want to be and I want you to help me get there.&rdquo; In the process, you communicate that because you have advised people in that situation before you understand what they are up against; who they are. And getting the client to view you as the one with the requisite knowledge and experience to get someone like them where they want to go is the first step in getting them to view you as their advisor.</p><p> Here are a few ideas on how you can apply this when creating stories to illustrate your value:</p><li> Pick a client to describe that is similar to the person you want to talk to.</li><li> Describe something that client wanted.</li><li> Describe a challenge or situation that stood between where the client was when you met them and the situation that they wanted.</li><li> Describe the specific aspects of your service that helped the client overcome the obstacle and achieve what they desired. (Not everything you did for them. Just focus on the particulars that contributed to the specific goal.)</li><li> Paint a picture of the client after overcoming the challenge or accomplishing the goal.</li><p> Make your clients the heroes and you will find that other people want to take the same journey with you.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-07 16:36:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-07 16:36:20.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_p2f8G2Q.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-many-benefits-of-making-your-client-the-hero/\", \"post_id\": \"12333\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-07 16:36:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-07 16:36:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-many-benefits-of-making-your-client-the-hero\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12332\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5990\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Many-Benefits-of-Making-Your-Client-the-Hero.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"768\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467972000,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5753,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Conversation About the Fear of Jobs Being Lost to Automation and Robots","link":"a-conversation-about-the-fear-of-jobs-being-lost-to-automation-and-robots","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Before we can address the question of what jobs will be created for humans as automation takes over current roles, we need to focus on a question that most people are not asking. <br/>  </h3><p> We have so many people talking about the future of work and yet, work has evolved so much over the last few decades that we no longer have an understanding of what work is. Is it having a job? Is it getting a paycheque? Is it contributing to society? What work will look like is an important question we need to ask before we focus on skills and jobs. What kind of world do we want to live in, anyway?</p><h3> What if purpose mattered? <br/>  </h3><p> In the current western world, we like to segment everything into neat little boxes, and in that process, meaning is lost. While businesses come out of peoples&rsquo; passions to create something in the world that others would find valuable, we&rsquo;ve turned people into consumers that need to be sold and marketed.</p><p> From an organizational perspective, too often we lead with structure instead of purpose. For example, most organizations claim to hire the best and the brightest, and yet most of their efforts focus on transactions like recruiting and onboarding instead of shepherding people throughout their time with the organization by providing them with ongoing information sharing and the ability to feel like they are valued every day.</p><h3> What if we asked new questions and created conversations? <br/>  </h3><p> In this business journey, we have lost our way. The first question we need to focus on is how work fits into our changing lives. Work is not separate from life, nor is it more important, although many people define themselves by what they do (i.e. their title and organization affiliation). At a recent talk, I was asked how we could help people on the verge of retiring who feel that they will no longer be able to share with people who they are. The answer is simple: This is an opportunity for us to take our voice back and see life as an adventure, of which work is only a small part. What if we created sessions where people can talk openly about who they are in the world and why they are here that focuses on making a life instead of making a living?</p><h3> What if fear of automation and technology is not new? <br/>  </h3><p> The automation of the auto industry brought job losses. But some of these are &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; that are better off without human involvement, like elevator operators or factory work. They illustrate the need for us to ask ourselves new questions, like whether it would be more valuable to society and our world if we had more people feeling like the work they do is valuable and makes an impact.</p><p> One of the biggest changes we face today is the need to let go of fear and focus on what we can create. When we create people-centric organizations, we start designing work differently. We stop putting band-aid solutions on antiquated systems that are cracking. We can either buy into our fear and rush into creating tips and tricks for people to &ldquo;save&rdquo; their ability to &ldquo;work&rdquo; or we can create forums where we have open conversations on what our world, society and lives look like and, as a result, what role work has in our healthy lives. These conversations are popping up now on the edges and not in the mainstream, where fear unfortunately continues to guide the conversation.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> What if there is only H:H (Human to Human) instead of B:C (Business to Consumer)? <br/>  </h3><p> When we create thriving 21st-century organizations that are people-centric, we will not worry about jobs. We will remember the purpose of our organizations: to create projects and initiatives to deliver them, and to bring in people to co-create with and thrive.</p><p> The skill that is needed here is a &ldquo;what do we want to create on the planet?&rdquo; mindset. We need intuition, imagination and creativity. We need people to understand that we are in the human-to-human experience and purpose-driven era, where business is a force  of good that does not threaten humanity or our planet with constant loss and fear.</p><p> This cannot happen in a world where furniture is an asset on a financial spreadsheet and people are deemed a liability.</p><h3> What is the bigger focus? <br/>  </h3><p> The bigger question to ask is, when do we start valuing people more than shareholder value that requires constant layoffs and shuffling the deck chairs so the ship won&rsquo;t sink?</p><p> In the words of Bryan Welch, CEO of B the Change Media from my upcoming book,</p><p> &ldquo;We are on the verge of a revolution in business. Consumers are becoming more aware every day of the availability of information and their own power to understand the value systems that govern businesses and to demand that the businesses they patronize share their values. What&rsquo;s about to happen is that people are going to start exercising that power. Businesses are going to need to do good in the world to earn the patronage of their customers. As this occurs, business will become the most powerful force for good that human society has ever seen.&rdquo;</p><p> We&rsquo;re facing both a choice and a huge opportunity for the future of humanity and our world. Are you ready for creating people-centered organizations where robots, technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are not part of the equation?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-07 16:40:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-07 16:40:28.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_6hRMsG1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-conversation-about-the-fear-of-jobs-being-lost-to-automation-and-robots/\", \"post_id\": \"12335\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-07 16:40:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-07 16:40:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-conversation-about-the-fear-of-jobs-being-lost-to-automation-and-robots\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12334\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5991\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A-Conversation-About-the-Fear-of-Jobs-Being-Lost-to-Automation-and-Robots.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"868\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1467997200,"author_id":48,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5755,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Tips to Protect Your Financial Future When Facing Divorce","link":"5-tips-to-protect-your-financial-future-when-facing-divorce","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anyone among us who doesn&rsquo;t have a story about 2008. Whether you lost a significant chunk of your retirement savings (at least temporarily), watched your parents struggle, or saw your colleagues panic and your friends lose their homes, it was a devastating period.</h3><p> <br/> The market has been volatile ever since even as it slowly and surely climbs to new highs. However, there&rsquo;s a situation many people&mdash;especially older couples&mdash;face all the time that has the power to bring on even greater long-term financial devastation. What is this monstrous risk? Divorce.</p><p> Denise emailed me last week, and I was surprised to hear the elation and relief in her voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m finally doing it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted a divorce for years, but I finally got the courage to make the leap. Even better, Doug feels the same, so I think it will be pretty easy. Amicable even.&rdquo;</p><p> Before the words were out of her mouth, I felt my stomach drop. I hated to burst her bubble, but I also know the reality all too well. When couples divorce, no matter how &ldquo;amicable&rdquo; the situation may be, financial distress is inevitable. Add even the slightest bit of hostility to the mix, and you can be sure that distress will increase.</p><p> While I wish there was a way to ease the road ahead, or at least add even a tiny sugar coating, the fact is that there&rsquo;s rarely a way to avoid the personal financial downturn that comes with divorce. No matter how much you&rsquo;d both like a different outcome, this  will  be your &ldquo;personal 2008.&rdquo; Your assets  will  be divided in half. You  will  have two households to support, two retirements to fund and, if children are involved, two &ldquo;family&rdquo; vacations to pay for&mdash;all further compounded by legal fees to iron out custody details on top of everything else.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I would never wish for anyone to stay in a marriage only for financial reasons. Life is too short for a couple to stay in a non-productive, dysfunctional relationship. However, the sooner both parting parties face the fiscal realities of divorce, the sooner they can begin to make the appropriate adjustments to move forward financially. It&rsquo;s a tough mandate considering the emotional turmoil in motion, but it&rsquo;s a must.</p><p> Rather than breaking the news to Denise on the phone, we scheduled a meeting to look at the details. When we sat face to face, here&rsquo;s what I shared:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Be prepared for a lifestyle change.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve seen people stuck in faulty assumptions, unable to let go of lifestyle changes, even keeping an unaffordable house &ldquo;for the kids&rsquo; sake.&rdquo; Often, downsizing in every way is not only optimal, but mandatory. If your happiness is based on living in the same place and affording the same luxuries, you&rsquo;re in for a rude awakening. This shift is huge, and you need to understand the ramifications at the outset.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Be realistic about your budget.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Yes, this includes supporting two households, and that will eat up a major chunk of any expendable income, but mortgage and rent are not the only factors. As soon as you have a clear picture of your monthly income, you&rsquo;ll need to create a budget that matches that number to avoid an increase in debt due to overspending.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  3. Include retirement in your planning.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Couples who remain together can anticipate the reduced expenses that come with a single dwelling and shared expenses. Going solo means you&rsquo;ll need even more to support your non-earning years. If you&rsquo;re over 50, consider making &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; contributions to your retirement. If that&rsquo;s not possible, at the very least, be sure you are contributing every month to help ensure you don&rsquo;t outlive your assets as a single.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t count on the promises of your attorney.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> While I do hope that most divorce attorneys are striving to act in your best interest, we&rsquo;re all optimists at heart and, even more so, some attorneys will tell you only what you want to hear. Wait until your case is closed to spend money that&rsquo;s not yet in your pocket. Once your Marital Settlement Agreement is final, you&rsquo;ll have an accurate sense of your financial capacity. Until then, keep your wallet closed as much as possible.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Keep an eye on the details.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re on your spouse&rsquo;s health insurance plan, those benefits may end when your divorce is final. If you decide to sell your home post-divorce, you may face capital gains taxes if the appreciation is greater than $250K. However, if you sell &ldquo;incident to divorce,&rdquo; you and your spouse may  both  qualify for a $500K exemption from capital gains instead of just half that amount. (A transfer is incident to divorce if it occurs within one year after the marriage ceases, or if it is related to cessation of the marriage.) Details add up and have a major impact on your financial health&mdash;now and down the road. Work with a professional advisor to be sure you know which decisions matter most, and when.</p><p> When Denise and I finished talking, she wasn&rsquo;t on the same cloud nine. Reality checks are rarely comfortable. But she did tell me she felt much more prepared for what was to come. &ldquo;It may not be as easy as I thought it could be,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m still certain we&rsquo;ll all be happier over the long term. I know I have some serious homework to do!&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;re facing divorce, I urge you to take a close look at your finances and make the best possible decisions as you walk this new path. Whether you&rsquo;re wearing rose-colored glasses or are mired in the common distress and shock of it all, taking time out to review the money side of the equation may make it much easier to find joy as you enter a whole new phase of life. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-10 14:11:31.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-10 14:11:31.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_ngt8Pun.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-tips-to-protect-your-financial-future-when-facing-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"12339\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-10 14:11:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-10 14:11:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-tips-to-protect-your-financial-future-when-facing-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12338\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5993\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-Tips-to-Protect-Your-Financial-Future-When-Facing-Divorce.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"795\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468252800,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}

One of my all-time favorite books, Gladwell offered examples and case studies about how small sociological changes tipped the behavior of the masses.</h3><p> <br/> Think of a seesaw. The tipping point is the point at which more people choose to make the emotional leap onto one side over the other, changing the balance and weighing one side down, while the other side is stranded in the air, feet dangling.</p><p> Ironically, my copy of Gladwell&rsquo;s book met its fate on what may have been the largest tipping point in U.S. history &ndash; while sitting on the shelf in my office on the 64 th floor of Two World Trade Center.</p><p> For many, myself included, 9/11 was the tipping point that handed us a fear and hatred of Muslims. Call me na&iuml;ve, but before that day, it had never even dawned on me that I had unknown enemies.</p><p> As I went through the stages of grief in the days immediately following 9/11, I clearly remember saying words that I never expected to come out of my mouth, nor would I ever want my kids to hear me say. With my screen door open, and my Muslim neighbor (one of my best friends at the time) likely within earshot, I screamed, &ldquo;All Muslims should be killed!&rdquo;</p><p> It took only seconds for the shame of what I had just said to settle in. I truly knew better. And I quickly jumped off the side of the seesaw where anger and generalizations took their seat.</p><p> I also remember that days later a group of my friends, including the same Muslim friend and his cousin, all went to the local bowling lanes to try and lighten the mood. The whole time, I feared for all of us that there might be some backlash from others who felt the same anger that I had felt just days before.</p><p> Why am I telling you this?</p><p> My heart hurts. The seesaw now has so many people on the side of hatred and anger and no one&rsquo;s willing to get off.</p><p> I would say it was just the events in Louisiana, Minnesota and Dallas that&rsquo;s breaking me. But isn&rsquo;t it so much more than that?</p><p> The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. Random acts of violence against Muslims. Heck, even the explosive reaction to the well-publicized death of Harambe after a child made his way into the gorilla&rsquo;s enclosure.</p><p> I hurt because we are just so angry. And only getting angrier.</p><h3> For a country that is supposed to be united, we are more divided than ever. On just about everything.</h3><p> <br/> And listen, I will not pretend to know all the details. I will not make speculations about who was in the right and who was in the wrong in any of these cases.</p><p> I just keep wondering at what point will people be ready to get off the side of anger and tip the scales back the other way?</p><p> In the days after my office was demolished by terrorists, I went back to New York to work. I have never seen a friendlier, gentler city than I did at that time.  As sad as we all were, we were there for one another &ndash; strangers and all.</p><p> But it shouldn&rsquo;t take something of 9/11 magnitude to tip the seesaw back in the direction of understanding and acceptance of one another.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-10 14:16:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-10 14:16:47.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_Uj8yGmK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-will-our-anger-hit-the-tipping-point/\", \"post_id\": \"12340\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-10 14:16:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-10 14:16:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-will-our-anger-hit-the-tipping-point\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12338\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5994\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-Tips-to-Protect-Your-Financial-Future-When-Facing-Divorce.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"634\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468231200,"author_id":58,"chart_url":""}

This has been expected for some time. But the Millennials&mdash;people born in the 1980s and 1990s, who were supposed to replace them&mdash;aren&rsquo;t stepping up the way they were expected to.</h3><p> <br/> The <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/stop-telling-millennials-get-lawn/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Millennials </a> &mdash;one of the most studied generations in history&mdash;supposedly like public service and doing meaningful work, and don&rsquo;t care that much about making money. &ldquo;Millennials want to have a sense of mission and purpose when it comes to their work lives,&rdquo; noted a 2014 <a href=\"https://www.fedview.opm.gov/2014FILES/FEVS_MillennialsReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  report on Millennials </a> from the federal government&rsquo;s Office of Personnel Management (OPM). &ldquo;They want what they do to matter and to make a difference. Millennials also believe in the promise of government. Three-quarters of that generation believes government has the potential to address societal challenges, such as lack of educational opportunities, the need for job skills and training, and protecting the environment.&rdquo;</p><p> Using the public sector as an example, it was expected that Millennials would flock to this. And this was true&mdash;for a while. But studies are finding that they aren&rsquo;t staying in government, particularly the federal government.</p><p> In fact, a recent survey found that government-wide employee satisfaction and commitment drops 10 points after the first year of federal employment, and while the satisfaction rate does creep up a bit after that, it never reaches the same level during an individual&rsquo;s time in government.</p><p> This is particularly true of Millennials. &ldquo;Data show that the percentage of the federal workforce under age 30 dropped from 9.1 to 6.6 percent, a steady reduction of more than 45,000 employees between 2010 and 2015,&rdquo; writes the Partnership for Public Service in its report, Improving the Employee Experience . &ldquo;Those under 25 dropped from an already low 2 percent to an alarming 0.9 percent during the same period. In contrast, in the entire U.S. workforce, 23.5 percent are under age 30. Federal employees under the age of 30 are also slightly less satisfied overall than all other employees.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> So why are they leaving? And why are they unhappy?</p><li> <strong>  Hiring&mdash;It&rsquo;s hard to get hired in the federal government, especially for less-experienced people. </strong> &ldquo;Since 2003, less than half of employees agreed with the statement, &lsquo;My work unit is able to recruit people with the right skills,&rsquo;&rdquo; writes the Partnership. &ldquo;In 2014, only 39.2 percent of the federal employee survey respondents said their teams can attract the right people.&rdquo; A similar survey found that 42 percent of federal agency leaders reported that they were unable to recruit the best employees, due to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/millennials-exit-the-federal-workforce-as-government-jobs-lose-their-allure/2014/12/15/ea3d4418-7fd4-11e4-9f38-95a187e4c1f7_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  slow hiring process </a> , the outdated civil service system, and the hard-to-navigate USAJOBS. gov federal employment job site. &ldquo;For those millennials who still want to land a government job, the hiring process can be an infuriating mystery,&rdquo; writes Lisa Rein in the Washington Post .</li><li> <strong>  Advancement&mdash;Another well-known trait of Millennials is that they like to move on to other things. </strong> But the pace of government is too slow for them, especially with a number of political challenges that have kept promotions and raises in check in recent years. Moreover, government promotions tend to be predicated on experience and seniority rather than by merit.</li><li> <strong>  Training&mdash;Millennials like to keep learning, and have complained that they don&rsquo;t have the opportunity in government. </strong> &ldquo;Less than half of all federal employees (46.8 percent) surveyed in 2014 reported being satisfied with the training they receive, and this number has dropped by 8.6 points from the highest level in 2005,&rdquo; according to the report. In comparison, 62 percent of private sector employees are satisfied with their training. Similarly, the PwC report, <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/services/consulting/documents/millennials-at-work.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Millennials at Work: Shaping the Workplace </a> , found that &ldquo;The opportunity for personal development&rdquo; came in first as the reason why a Millennial chose a particular job. The salary? That was fourth.</li><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> &ldquo;The reality is that Millennials are attracted to government work because they want to feel like they&rsquo;re giving back to the community, but <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/220696-why-millennials-want-government-jobs-and-then-quit-them\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  quickly leave </a> when they feel caught in a slog of forms and red tape upon taking up the position,&rdquo; writes Rachel Burger in The Hill .</p><p> All this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, except that the long-awaited wave of Baby Boomer <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/blogs/by-the-numbers/gov-aging-public-sector-has-some-of-oldest-workers-set-to-retire.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  retirements in government </a> &mdash;sometimes known as the &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/wave-of-retirements-hitting-federal-workforce/2013/08/26/97adacee-09b8-11e3-8974-f97ab3b3c677_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  silver tsunami </a> &rdquo;&mdash;is finally happening.

Of course, Buyer&rsquo;s School never does. Debriefing with his Sales Evolution coach he explained that he had experienced difficulty getting the prospect into a discussion of the buyer&rsquo;s problems and priorities, and when he finally did the conversation quickly turned to product and price.</p><p> Thinking back on his training and remembering that buyers frequently leave out vital information, especially on the first call, he knew he&rsquo;d been had. And, what got left out was the information that Chris needed to get some traction with this buyer. Without an effective approach to transition from chit chat to a meaningful conversation on business issues, he got trapped discussing facts and figures as opposed to issues and the real reason he was invited in to meet.</p><h3> To better manage expectations with the buyer, Chris needs to have a better Investigation meeting and to learn more about the buyer&rsquo;s process (Authority).</h3><p> <br/> Perhaps starting early and giving them some homework before the appointment is a better approach to keep from getting trapped in Buyer&rsquo;s School. Before his next appointment he asked his buyer the following, &ldquo;Mr. Buyer, in order to make our meeting as productive as possible, would you make a list of the two or three most challenging issues you are having with respect to your business and this product? Then we can really focus our discussion on your issues and try to develop a solution. Does that make sense?&rdquo; Interestingly enough, he found that buyer and the next few he asked were all more comfortable talking about the real issues because that was really on their minds and all they had to do was refer to their own list.</p><p> When he arrived at the appointment, he simply reminded the buyer about the list and asked what the issues were. From that beginning the problems and priorities conversation was easy enough to conduct.

{"original_id":5759,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Six Items to Research When Selecting a Tactical Manager","link":"six-items-to-research-when-selecting-a-tactical-manager","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The number of tactical ETF Strategists has increased since the 2008 Financial Crisis as advisers look for managers able to navigate uncertain market conditions. According to Morningstar, as of the end of the first quarter of 2016, there were 156 ETF strategists managing $76 billion in client assets. Over 67% are characterized generically as tactical managers. As the market for ETFs grows, so does the demand for tactical managers, and the need for a system by which to evaluate managers grows.</p><p> Below we offer six factors that should be considered when assessing a tactical manager.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Live and Backtested Performance: </strong></h3><p> <br/> When evaluating a tactical manager, compare the manager&rsquo;s live performance track record to their hypothetical backtest results. This will help assess the efficacy of a manager&rsquo;s philosophy and process. Backtests are often ridden with errors, but they do offer a glimpse into the rigor and durability of a manager&rsquo;s strategies. If the manager&rsquo;s live track record does not demonstrate similar values to those predicted by the back tests, it may suggest that the manager is still attempting to solve the last problem that the market encountered rather than focusing on the next one.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Riskiest Portfolio: </strong></h3><p> <br/> A tactical portfolio manager will reconstitute his portfolio over time, attempting to best navigate the market&rsquo;s waters. This will lessen the value gleaned from metrics of skill based on averages, like Sharpe ratios. We believe average-based skill metrics only tell part of the manager&rsquo;s story. You should have an idea of what a manager&rsquo;s riskiest portfolio looks like and make sure you are comfortable using that portfolio for your clients in any environment. An improved understanding of a manager&rsquo;s riskiest portfolio will help you understand the risk you take on if the manager&rsquo;s algorithms fail to accurately capture the market.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Batting Average in Both Up and Down Markets: </strong></h3><p> <br/> What are you looking for in a manager? If you&rsquo;re looking for aggressive upside in good markets or protection in down markets, the importance of assessing a manager&rsquo;s skill in these regimes is imperative. As part of this evaluation, you should check that a manager&rsquo;s historical returns match the desired application by calculating their batting average. A batting average looks at a manager&rsquo;s ability to outperform the benchmark but does not evaluate by how much the manager outperforms; it only takes into account the number of months the manager beat the benchmark in rising and falling markets. If the manager is focused on downside protection but has a poor batting average in down markets, you may need to dig deeper into the validity of their strategies.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Upside and Downside Capture: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Upside and downside capture go hand in hand with batting average; they detail the magnitude of a manager&rsquo;s outperformance. The data allows you to see a manager&rsquo;s magnitude of relative outperformance or underperformance in both up and down markets. Using upside and downside capture in concert with batting average will enable you to gain a better understanding of the durability of a manager&rsquo;s process.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  5. Drawdowns: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Drawdowns quantify a portfolio&rsquo;s absolute decline in value by measuring the percentage change between the peak and its associated trough. No client likes to see a large percentage of their wealth disappear in down markets, no matter how good the manager may be in rising markets. Evaluating a manager&rsquo;s past drawdowns will give you an indication of the risks of placing a client&rsquo;s wealth under their management.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Turnover Over Time: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Turnover for a tactical manager indicates how often and by how much they rebalance their portfolio, giving you an idea of the portfolio&rsquo;s stability and success over time. Turnover will also indicate the appropriateness of the manager given your clients&rsquo; tax implications.</p><p> Choosing a tactical manager involves taking into account a lot of data and information, and every adviser and every client brings his or her own goals and priorities to the table. Every person chooses to weigh certain factors more than others. However, the six points mentioned above apply not only to tactical managers; they are important to any type of manager. It&rsquo;s important to consider all six as you consider entrusting assets into an investment program. In the end, you share fiduciary responsibility with the chosen manager, and you should therefore do everything in your power to ensure a desirable outcome for both you and your client. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-10 14:47:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-10 14:47:11.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_8Qjk49x.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/six-items-to-research-when-selecting-a-tactical-manager/\", \"post_id\": \"12346\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-10 14:47:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-10 14:47:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"six-items-to-research-when-selecting-a-tactical-manager\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12345\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5998\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Six-Items-to-Research-When-Selecting-a-Tactical-Manager.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"470\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468224000,"author_id":247,"chart_url":""}

I didn&rsquo;t treat myself with love and care. I&rsquo;d emotionally devalue myself, and engage in negative self-talk that wasn&rsquo;t healthy. Usually, that I wasn&rsquo;t enough of something:  <i>  not smart enough, not pretty enough, not skinny enough, not successful enough </i> . I&rsquo;d compare and measure myself up against everyone else; what I was lacking or missing out on in life.</p><p> Also, I didn&rsquo;t always trust myself either. I&rsquo;d rely on what everyone else thought and would constantly get everyone&rsquo;s opinions on something before I&rsquo;d make a decision. I had zero confidence in my own wisdom.</p><p> With the constant comparing and inability to listen to my inner voice, I came to realize I didn&rsquo;t know what true happiness was for me.

{"original_id":5761,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Put The Balance Back In Your Business and Make Room for More","link":"put-the-balance-back-in-your-business-and-make-room-for-more","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Balance in Business is typically understood as having organized files and a streamlined workflow. Those things are important, but in themselves won&rsquo;t equate to a balance because those things won&rsquo;t create a state of equilibrium inside your organization. In order to achieve that, your leaders, high-achievers and high-potential employees should trust the people and systems that are positioned to help them help you.</p><p> Employees should look forward to coming to work and sharing their abilities with an understanding that your company will increase their capacity and maximize their potential.</p><p> How can you put balance back in business? It&rsquo;s a simple as 1-2-3.</p><h3> <strong>  1. STOP. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The goal is to prepare employees to propel inside your company, ensuring your end customers receive the best in service and delivery, elevating your organization to the top of your industry. In order to do that, you are going to have to stop and take a pulse of what their needs are. You can have your leaders attend a thousand trainings, participate in train-the-trainer forums and assess the whole company on what their personality, communication and leadership style is which will result in you just having a better understanding of what exactly? The diversity that you already knew existed and clarity on why John, Jane, Jill and Joe have different work styles.</p><p> Tell me, what exactly has that knowledge done to retain those people? Has it made them stop looking for alternative jobs every chance they get or decrease the amount of time they spend having private conversations about how unfulfilled they are? Assessments are great, but not in isolation. Once you have your data, you need to stop and take a pulse on what that means for those individuals you&rsquo;ve just reduced to numbers and letters on a spreadsheet.</p><p> They are more than owls, birds or lions via their informative and semi-entertaining profile. They have lives that require them to leave space for joy, healthy relationships and sleep.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Make Room. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Yes, make room for the changes you are striving to introduce. Making room for Balance in Business will involve rolling up a few sleeves and knocking down the walls of outdated norms, stagnation and toxicity. Leaving room for the transformational culture where people are effective, engaging and innovative. If you&rsquo;ve done your job to ensure this experience, then your employees will have room to work on their life balance outside of work hours.</p><h3> <strong>  3. No more Band-Aids on Bullet Wounds. </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s typically a work-life balance challenge when there are too many business issues bleeding into personal hours. Far too many companies try to cover up the gaping wounds of overextension and lack of boundaries but throwing a few band-aids over everything. Oh, you don&rsquo;t think your organization does that? Hm, let&rsquo;s think about the last few thousand you spent on an office-wide breakfast with donuts and a few slices of fruit to say thank you for closing on a 90 hour a week project. Or perhaps it was that delicious round of pizza and sandwiches for all that should&rsquo;ve made most feel appreciated&hellip; Your employees don&rsquo;t want to be pacified, they need down time to build and nurture their relationships, to color the other shades of themselves and enjoy their personal development process. Munchies just won&rsquo;t do.</p><p> When you fail to balance the business you push your employees against a wall to choose themselves over your projects. Some will simply adapt and find ways to give you bare minimum. Others will work themselves right into a bottle of Xanax as their new normal coping mechanism and call it the grind. Though some, the boldest of the bunch will choose to breathe, outside of your walls and take their skills, aptitude, energy and your IP ( Intellectual Property ) right out the door to and opportunity that appreciates them quite a bit more.</p><p> <strong>  Advice in a nutshell: </strong> If you don&rsquo;t want to lose great people, focus on your original company vision to be the best and choose to put balance in the business.

{"original_id":5763,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Market Volatility and the Emergence of 10 Toxic Client Types","link":"market-volatility-and-the-emergence-of-10-toxic-client-types","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Market volatility is unsettling for most financial advisors. Dealing with up and down conditions is tough, but what makes it even worse is the emergence of &ldquo;toxic clients&rdquo; who begin calling frantically. These clients are &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; because they can have a poisonous effect on both the advisor&rsquo;s mental and physical health.</p><p> Advisors who consult with me complain about anticipating these dreaded calls from clients who suffer from what I refer to as market &ldquo;Collapse-O-Phobia.&rdquo; They continually demand explanations and/or reassurance from their advisor. Dealing with these clients taxes the patience of advisors and exacerbates their frustration, self-doubt and anxiety, raising the probability of advisors succumbing to burnout.</p><p> Because many advisors are hesitant to send any business away, they will put up with unbearable, demanding, self-centered clients, whose behaviors can add exponentially to the advisor&rsquo;s career-related stress.</p><p> But, as their advisor, you have a choice. You don&rsquo;t have to retain these clients. Many advisors who have culled these clients from their &ldquo;herd&rdquo; note that because their stress was dramatically relieved after doing so, they were much more successful prospecting for replacement clients, thus they did not suffer a loss of AUM as a result of eliminating the toxic ones.</p><p> Undoubtedly, you will meet prospective clients with these toxic traits, but you won&rsquo;t see the traits because these prospects will be on their best behavior, waiting for you to sign them on. Many may be high-value prospects, thus tempting you to ignore the warning signs as you sell them on coming on board.  My goal is to help you to recognize toxic traits that may be lurking behind a veneer of good behavior and make the hard decisions about whether it is in your best interest to take on or retain such people.</p><p> For current toxic clients, I suggest doing this culling on your birthday or anniversary, etc., so that you give yourself the wonderful gift of peace of mind.</p><p> In my book,  &ldquo;The Financial Advisor&rsquo;s Ultimate Stress Mastery Guide,&rdquo;  I describe 10 toxic personality types you are likely to encounter and which you should consider avoiding or eliminating from your practice. Because you have not learned how to recognize the warning signs prior to accepting these types as clients, it is highly likely that you already have such clients in your practice. I will describe the first two types here and the rest in subsequent articles.</p><h3> <strong>  1. The Abusive (Or Abrasive) Alan </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is a hostile, disrespectful person who keeps others at a distance with his abusive, insulting &ldquo;candor.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t use diplomacy in communicating and believes that being direct and &ldquo;telling it like it is&rdquo; all of the time is a virtue.  He seems to thrive on provoking and bullying people in a seemingly desperate need to show how smart he is. In fact, he feels powerful by &ldquo;putting down&rdquo; other respected people, such as his advisor.</p><p> Since this is often a high-value client, he believes you will continue to take whatever he dishes out; but can you afford to be constantly provoked by a client who has a chip on his shoulder from childhood and will act out a lifetime of insecurity and anger, attempting to bully or belittle you every time the market takes a skid?</p><h3> <strong>  2. The Controlling Connie </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Control freaks&rdquo; tend to be all-or-nothing thinkers, fearing that if they are not in control of everything in their lives, they will lose it all. They often expect perfection from everyone they deal with, so they hire you, expecting the perfect performance&mdash;consistently.</p><p> Since it&rsquo;s impossible for these clients to delegate complete responsibility to you, they micro-manage you, wanting to take part in and question every decision you make. Is it really in your best interest to retain a client who questions every move you make, worries about every dip in the market and obsessively questions most of your decisions?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  3. The &ldquo;Eddie Haskell&rdquo; Passive-Aggressive Client </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you are in your late 50&rsquo;s or older, you undoubtedly remember this fictional character from Leave It To Beaver , the popular 1950s TV show.  Eddie was a classic example of a passive-aggressive, toxic personality. This type of person tries to curry favor with you by slyly complimenting you, hiding his shallow, sneaky character and hostility behind a veneer of &ldquo;charm.&rdquo;  His main agenda is manipulation, while trying not to be obvious about it. If he slips and lets his hostility out, he covers himself by exclaiming,  &ldquo; I was just kidding .&rdquo;</p><p> These people are phony, kissing up to anyone whom they believe can do them any good.  Their needs always take priority over yours.</p><p> You obviously can&rsquo;t trust such an individual and what he says. How will you ever be able to get an accurate feel for this client&rsquo;s needs and concerns if he is a phony with you, while maintaining his hidden agenda?</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  4. The Gloom-And-Doom Debbie </strong></h3><p> <br/> We all know people who constantly bemoan their bad luck and predict that bad things will continue to happen to them and their money.  These pessimistic, negative people always feel like victims. If there are two ways to look at a situation, they always choose the negative way. In their catastrophic thinking patterns, they are filled with &ldquo;what if&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p> Any good news you give them about their financial situation will be quickly shut out by the first negative thought that comes into their mind. You show them how well an investment turned out and they respond with a &ldquo;Yes, but&hellip;&rdquo; In spite of your positive outlook, they believe that it&rsquo;s inevitable that something terrible will happen to their portfolio.</p><p> Is it worth it to be dragged down by the heavy, negative energy of such clients?</p><h3> <strong>  5. The High-Maintenance Marty </strong></h3><p> <br/> This type of client needs to be hand-held through every decision for him to feel safe and secure.  Sadly, he maintains a serious lack of self-esteem and rarely feels secure.</p><p> This client will become very dependent on you for constant reassurance and he will call regularly to see what decisions you have made in managing his accounts.</p><p> Warning: This dependency on you can bleed over into much more than your role as his financial advisor. Once he sees that you care and are responding to him, he may depend on you to help him make everyday decisions. He will look at you as his mentor, confidante or counselor.</p><p> Can you afford to spend the time and the emotionally draining outcomes necessary to manage such a needy client?</p><h3> <strong>  6. The Histrionic Harriet </strong></h3><p> <br/> This client has been rewarded in life because of the attention she gets with her dramatic, emotional, over-reactive behavior. Often exhibiting narcissistic qualities as well (see the Narcissistic Ned, in Part 3 of this series), you will exhaust yourself trying to accommodate her.</p><p> If you have clients who are actors, on-camera personalities, politicians or celebrities, you know this type. In their profession, they are praised and rewarded for exhibiting this behavior, but if this becomes part of their persona, these behaviors can weave into all of their interactions. You never know if you are dealing with the real person or the showman.</p><p> While they are often viewed as charismatic, charming, fun, lively and interesting, they become &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; when they don&rsquo;t feel as if they are getting the attention they demand. They often get frustrated or irritated with situations that involve delayed gratification. Because they are used to immediate gratification, they demand to speak with you immediately. This makes them very difficult to deal with during down markets, for example, when they want explanations  now !</p><h3> <strong>  7. The Narcissistic Ned </strong></h3><p> <br/> This client is an elitist and has a high need to be admired and adored. He is so wrapped up in himself that he believes he is your most important client, insisting on your attention whenever he wants it.  Since he feels entitled (perhaps because of the amount of fees he pays you), he may insist that your assistant should interrupt you to take his call.</p><p> These people spend most of their time looking for attention and accolades from everyone they meet.  Do you have the patience and wherewithal to give this energy-zapping client the time and consistent praise he demands?</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  8. The OCD Olivia </strong></h3><p> <br/> These clients are constantly anxious and attempt to moderate that anxiety by controlling every possible detail in their lives. This affects their interpersonal skills as they try to control conversations.  Having difficulty giving up control to anyone, they cannot delegate decisions and must be in on every decision that you make on their behalf.</p><p> What is really frustrating is that they are so concerned with being perfect and not making mistakes that they ruminate for hours over even little decisions.  This client is very difficult to work with and take a tremendous amount of your time, as you have great difficulty getting her to make timely decisions. You may even have to go into excruciating detail with her because of her underlying fear of making a mistake.</p><p> Can you afford the frustration that comes with this kind of client?</p><h3> <strong>  9. The Type A Ted </strong></h3><p> <br/> You are very familiar with Type A personality traits since it is highly likely that you possess many of them yourself. Since so many successful people possess Type A characteristics, it is highly likely that many of your clients fit this pattern. Type A traits are not a problem, per se.  It is only when the traits of having to be in total control and be perfect come into the equation, that they can be quite toxic.  Fearing the loss of control, such clients are easily angered and aggressive. They go way beyond assertiveness in dealing with everyone who they perceive as a threat.</p><p> With both of you having the need to be in control, can you see how keeping this client in your practice will ramp up your stress?</p><h3> <strong>  10. The Wishy-Washy Wanda </strong></h3><p> <br/> Constantly worrying about making a mistake, this client vacillates back and forth regarding any financial decision you need her to make.  Indecisiveness is the key to her sad existence. An extreme people pleaser, she tries to determine what YOU want her to say, rather than tell you how she really feels.  She doesn&rsquo;t want to offend you or have you judge her negatively.</p><p> These clients are chronically unhappy people because they rarely get their needs taken care of; instead, they spend all of their energy pleasing others, including you. Although she may be easy to manage because she wants to please you, you will never really know her true feelings and fears regarding her financial situation.</p><p> Can you afford to have these type of demanding, dramatic clients in your practice?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-10 16:41:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-10 16:41:13.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_CPUB5QF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/market-volatility-and-the-emergence-of-10-toxic-client-types/\", \"post_id\": \"12354\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-10 16:41:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-10 16:41:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"market-volatility-and-the-emergence-of-10-toxic-client-types\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12353\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6002\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Market-Volatility-and-the-Emergence-of-10-Toxic-Client-Types.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"903\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468227600,"author_id":153,"chart_url":""}

Having done website redesigns for over 17 years now, I can tell you that unless you carefully launch a new website, it can have adverse effects if you rely on your website for business development.</p><p> Even if your existing website is fantastic, chances are you&rsquo;ll want to update it someday. While website redesign can be a smart move,  <strong>  it could also cost you between   <a href=\"http://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-to-avoid-seo-disaster-during-a-website-redesign/42824/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   60-70 percent  </a>   in potential search traffic if you&rsquo;re not careful. </strong>  So now&rsquo;s the time to plan and make sure you have your ducks in a row.</p><p> <strong>  Most website redesigns for small and medium sized companies will cause a 5% &ndash; 15% drop in website traffic in the short term even if done right. </strong>  Fortunately, you  can  redesign your website without harming your business long term. Here&rsquo;s five ways to do it:</p><h3> 1. Collect user feedback.</h3><p> <br/> Before you update your site, it&rsquo;s important to know which elements benefit most from a redesign. Gathering user feedback is the easiest way to determine this.</p><li> What do your visitors want to see?</li><li> What kinds of information do they expect on the homepage?</li><li> Are there portions of your current website they find difficult to navigate?</li><li> Is there something they need but aren&rsquo;t getting?</li><li> Is website copy unclear, or does it resonate? <br/>  </li><p> Collecting this information at the  beginning  and even  during  the process will ensure your redesign is both efficient and effective. Tip: I&rsquo;ve used  <a href=\"http://www.usertesting.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  UserTesting.com </a>  for this for years. You should also ask some current customers to participate. Use your email list for something other than promotion!</p><p> <strong>  Another idea: </strong>   <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=d28dd2a1-5b88-40ea-8768-8b681aa86b1f&amp;placement_guid=b1b190c9-8543-458a-b348-8c1e4ab0e432&amp;portal_id=207256&amp;redirect_url=APefjpF2qo4_XDJ8gCX0oegy8LSg9WJ_wmMSzt90F-1Q9Xhzn8rIJE-QSjlipT76YlfKCUHk9WffQ9ZyQYwvn-AgShk-kijpYW9zFZ5At9T9StOQ2NV7OJi0y1u4u0BU_bHXiTqc4Pmw7-dH3FH8NKarN-P2cQge7yeXRoWvQe4M02UZAXNCb5TpcUwvWXKfgB_NdchfWq0Qii9wUBSPKBiS3L9EtLD5n8VP1dVq7lCqfxJsV8_EYNut3iYRvNEb5olGf53cKui4u_SoYUzUw-Kc0IqlfyqS9SKGiAhU4mlEMpNHf5_m8ouT2iskRytDcl-w68OuvLdPx5jAy59SGn8V6oXTYp7A-g&amp;hsutk=10dc17e19b2f01fe268a19ca623f98da&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rickwhittington.com%2Fblog%2Fredesign-website-without-damaging-business%2F&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rickwhittington.com%2Fblog%2Fredesign-website-without-damaging-business%2F&amp;__hstc=268771694.10dc17e19b2f01fe268a19ca623f98da.1458749375530.1466940832364.1468171061778.15&amp;__hssc=268771694.3.1468171061778&amp;__hsfp=3644121245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Did you know you can test your competitors' websites to find out what they do right (and wrong)? </a></p><p> During your redesign, you&rsquo;ll have differing opinions on design. Don&rsquo;t let the HIPPo (highest paid person&rsquo;s opinion) win out &mdash; listen to your customers instead. Here&rsquo;s your chance to say you listen to your customers and actually  do  it.</p><h3> 2. Include 301 redirects</h3><p> <br/> From a search engine optimization perspective, 301 redirects are a critical component of a website redesign, but they are often forgotten.</p><p> 301 redirects are permanent redirect signs that transfer up to  <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/2014/06/02/how-to-retain-at-least-95-of-your-organic-traffic-after-a-site-redesign/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  90 percent of ranking power </a>  from an old web page to a new one. Page redesign  <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/2014/09/19/how-to-redesign-your-website-without-losing-traffic-or-sales/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  typically results in 10-15 percent less traffic </a>  due to lost page ranking. However, correct use of  <a href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/redirection\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  301 redirects </a>  can help mitigate this loss. For more information on how to implement 301 redirects, consult  <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/create-301-redirect-map-203248\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this tutorial </a> .</p><p> 301 redirects are done on the server side, so you&rsquo;ll need to consult your web developer for this one. Just don&rsquo;t overlook it!</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 3. Create and submit a new sitemap</h3><p> <br/> Sitemaps are especially important during website redesign. Anytime you redesign your website, you&rsquo;ll need to  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">  create and submit a new sitemap </a>  to Google using Google Search Console.</p><p> Even though you&rsquo;re redirecting old URLs from your old website to new ones on the new website (see #2 above), you still need to submit the sitemap to let Google know about the new pages. This can help ensure any content that moves to a new URL is quickly discoverable by search engines.</p><p> If your website has fewer than 500 pages, you can create your sitemap file at  <a href=\"https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  xml-sitemaps.com&rsquo;s Sitemap Generator </a> . It&rsquo;s free, quick and easy.</p><h3> 4. Include calls to action on every page</h3><p> <br/> If you know ahead of time that you&rsquo;ll lose 5% &ndash; 15% of your search engine traffic in the short term after a redesign, then  <strong>  making sure you have enough lead generation opportunities will offset that loss in traffic. </strong></p><p> We&rsquo;re redesigning a company website right now that previously had no calls to actions or landing pages. After digging, we found several resources that could be used as lead generation components, and the new website will have over 40 calls to action and over 30 landing pages. The leads this company will get after the redesign will surely offset any short term loss in traffic.</p><p> <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=6dd6020d-a3be-4307-b86a-c0d727ba1c58&amp;placement_guid=28ff2e6e-99fb-4ef8-882b-4cee86a605c1&amp;portal_id=207256&amp;redirect_url=APefjpE4yGIcTPdGLjQd8mPrsnMJx2Gxm8OaAnF0DRlXTYT3YtkFWA_3C7ZBsdC64_8qNHRf5xELp_4tRcxxH3uNkdZwF1c0vaSsEK2DgumjIw0tl2okC4hDOuU1QmCk7ghcG9Zrd1AfxW34_9N83FrThdf7vlHbHXyOwRmT6aHxzxE6GlY2THYFgNTOah71CmU4OMQezLoDG_OdST00y0FTdiKCAeM8GXQY48I5PIzNM2M7MplJxIGWVOwuW2xUn47FIi3Ht7eJiT3IOO3O06L1F64dKt0Nau7N7eMF-VuX5UtqnnY_m6B_JL-uJgvoAUFi1Wo3HHvaMrW9JAM65XuSFJn2UmUmyw&amp;hsutk=10dc17e19b2f01fe268a19ca623f98da&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rickwhittington.com%2Fblog%2Fredesign-website-without-damaging-business%2F&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rickwhittington.com%2Fblog%2Fredesign-website-without-damaging-business%2F&amp;__hstc=268771694.10dc17e19b2f01fe268a19ca623f98da.1458749375530.1466940832364.1468171061778.15&amp;__hssc=268771694.3.1468171061778&amp;__hsfp=3644121245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The 7 Ingredients You Need To Make A Killer Call To Action </a></p><h3>  5. Send a post-launch announcement with survey</h3><p> <br/> Once your redesigned website is up and running, you will want to consider sending a post-launch announcement to your email file. This is especially important if your customers need to be able to locate a &ldquo;login&rdquo; or &ldquo;support&rdquo; link that they use frequently. For example, if a financial institution moves the account login button or form when it redesigns, then it&rsquo;s imperative to let customers know.</p><p> Earlier this year the CEO of UpWork wrote an extensive blog post explaining the rationale behind his company&rsquo;s decision to change its name and website, and sent it out via email.</p><p> At the same time you release your announcement, continue gathering user feedback and making needed changes to further optimize the site&rsquo;s functionality. You can do this with more user testing, paying careful attention to changes in your web analytics KPIs.  <strong>  You might want to solicit some customer feedback in the email by asking them to visit your website and fill out a very short survey. Offer an open-ended &ldquo;comments?&rdquo; question in the survey so they can write what they like or don&rsquo;t like about the new website.  </strong></p><p> While redesigning a site  can  negatively impact its traffic and sales, it doesn&rsquo;t  have  to. These five simple steps can help you avoid disaster and facilitate a smooth site redesign from start to finish.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-10 17:24:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-10 17:24:01.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_MEjXiJU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-ways-to-redesign-your-website-without-damaging-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"12356\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-10 17:24:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-10 17:24:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-ways-to-redesign-your-website-without-damaging-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12355\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6003\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-Ways-to-Redesign-Your-Website-Without-Damaging-Your-Business.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"394\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468249200,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5765,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Dr. Daniel Crosby: Q&A With a Behavioral Finance Expert","link":"dr-daniel-crosby-qa-with-a-behavioral-finance-expert","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Lauren Davis</p><p> I had the privilege of meeting  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Personal-Benchmark-Integrating-Behavioral-Investment/dp/1118963326\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  New York Times bestselling author </a>  Dr. Daniel Crosby at  <a href=\"https://finconexpo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  FinCon </a>  in 2014. During his keynote address at the conference, he spoke about the intersection of finance and behavioral psychology. As anyone in the financial industry knows, investors&rsquo; emotions and behaviors can make or break the achievement of their goals. In an effort to learn more about how this concept shapes the way advisers interact with their clients and market themselves, I conducted a Q&amp;A with Dr. Crosby to coincide with the release of his second book, &ldquo;The Laws of Wealth: Psychology and the secret to investing success,&rdquo; which was released on June 27. Find Dr. Crosby on Twitter  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielcrosby\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  @danielcrosby </a>  and on LinkedIn.</p><h3> <strong>  Can you introduce yourself and explain your role in the financial services industry? </strong></h3><p> <br/> I have two primary roles: one as a consultant around financial behavior and the second as an asset manager. My consulting work is through Brinker Capital&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://clients0.brinkercapital.com/centerforoutcomes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Center for Outcomes </a> , a program designed to help advisers become better at doing what they do best &ndash; manage investor behavior. Studies from Vanguard, Morningstar, Aon Hewitt and others show that investors who work with advisers receive a 2 to 3 percent boost in annualized returns as a result of behavioral coaching. Of course, an adviser&rsquo;s best advice is only as effective as it is influential to the client, so we help advisers become more persuasive.</p><p> On the asset management side, I incorporate the great body of research around decision-making into my stock selection at my firm,  <a href=\"http://www.nocturnecapital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nocturne Capital </a> . I am of the opinion that asset management is grossly over-engineered and fails to implement much of the extant behavioral finance research. So, if there is an overarching goal, it is to help investors make and keep more money by adherence to sound psychological principles.</p><h3> <strong>  We&rsquo;re all very excited about your new book, &ldquo;The Laws of Wealth: Psychology and the secret to investing success.&rdquo; What lessons and tips will RIAs who read the book take away from it? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Part One of the book is about managing yourself and Part Two is about managing your wealth. The first half speaks to my 10 commandments of investor behavior. Ten simple, but not easy, behaviors that will help you keep more of your money. Part Two is a bit wonkier and talks about the research on behavioral asset management. Basically, how you can increase returns by taking advantage of the fear and greed of others.</p><h3> <strong>  What sparked your interest in behavioral finance? </strong></h3><p> <br/> I was originally a finance major in college but took a two-year break (after my freshman year) to serve a mission for my church in Manila, Philippines. After two years of helping people turn their lives around and seeing lots of untreated mental illness, I thought that the best course for me would be to pursue a degree in psychology. About halfway through graduate school, I was already getting stressed out by having to talk to people at the lowest points in their life and wanted more positivity in mine. I began to look for business applications of psychology that would combine my love of thinking about why people do what they do with a non-clinical setting. I&rsquo;m the son of an adviser, so investment management was where I started and ended my search.</p><p> The financial services industry, as well as the markets, are constantly evolving, and regulations are always changing. To wit, the  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/the-dols-fiduciary-rule-the-best-marketing-for-your-financial-advice-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  DOL fiduciary rule </a>  was announced in April. From the perspective of a financial behavioral psychologist, what can RIAs, advisers and others do to prepare themselves for the constant changes, and how should they explain things to their clients? On one hand, they want to be transparent, but on the other hand, no one wants to cause undue stress upon their clients.</p><p> One of the primary advantages to working with an adviser is having someone to help you separate signal from noise. The presence of 24/7 news channels and financial TV is to draw attention, not to serve the needs of clients. The Fed releases 45,000 pieces of economic data each month, and the adviser has to help the client understand two things &ndash; most of it doesn&rsquo;t matter and what they should do about the parts that do matter. That said, the DOL fiduciary rule is a big disruptor and certainly qualifies as important &ldquo;signal&rdquo; for clients everywhere.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  How has behavioral finance influenced how financial services are marketed? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Very little, for better or worse. Behavioral finance has been used as a marketing tool (e.g., &ldquo;Come do business with us; we get investor behavior.&rdquo;), but I have seen very little evidence of what I call behavioral best practices integrated into the marketing approaches themselves. Exceptions to that rule include efforts by Brinker Capital, Barclays, Prudential and others, but most are still operating from a very traditional, staid approach. I&rsquo;d suggest that marketers everywhere read Robert Cialdini&rsquo;s excellent book, &ldquo;Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion&rdquo; and tweak their programs accordingly.</p><h3> <strong>  In your opinion, what are best practices for financial services firms to market themselves? What mistakes do you regularly see them make? </strong></h3><p> <br/> I live in Atlanta and recently visited the World of Coke tourist trap as a business field trip to try and dissect Coke&rsquo;s efforts at becoming the branding legend that it is today. The thing that struck me more than anything was the way that Coke markets a lifestyle and not a product. Coke&rsquo;s brand has always been about optimism, bringing the world together and being a part of happy moments. You will see exactly zero advertisements comparing the relative merits of Coke to Pepsi, because Coke gets that no one cares and that people aren&rsquo;t that rational. Smart marketers in our space will talk less about basis points and alpha and more about the kind of life their product provides.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-10 17:37:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-10 17:37:24.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_0ZkFBIV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dr-daniel-crosby-qa-with-a-behavioral-finance-expert/\", \"post_id\": \"12358\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-10 17:37:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-10 17:37:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dr-daniel-crosby-qa-with-a-behavioral-finance-expert\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12357\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6004\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Dr-Daniel-Crosby-QA-With-a-Behavioral-Finance-Expert.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1581\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468245600,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5766,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Asking for Employee Feedback Actually Saves Businesses Money","link":"asking-for-employee-feedback-actually-saves-businesses-money","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Employee engagement has a cascading effect on organizations. Someone who&rsquo;s satisfied with their workplace is more likely to stick around longer. And of course they&rsquo;ll be more productive. But on the other side of the fence, an employee who is down in the dumps won&rsquo;t be as productive and has a higher chance of quitting.</h3><p> <br/> Good riddance, right? Wrong. The cost of an employee leaving is extremely expensive. So is the cost of recruitment. Yet organizations are still spending a heaping amount of money on their employee engagement strategies when they can put half of that amount of money towards a pulsing survey. Here&rsquo;s how these surveys can actually save organizations money:</p><h3> <strong>  Current Cost of Engagement </strong></h3><p> <br/> Employee happiness should be at the heart of any company. But consider what this study by Bersin &amp; Associates found:</p><p> &ldquo;Organizations currently invest approximately $720 million annually in engagement improvement, including both outsourced and internally developed programs. Only 50% of the potential market has been tapped, with half the organizations stating an interest in engagement programs actually investing.&rdquo;</p><p> How&rsquo;s that working out for people? Well, the outlook isn&rsquo;t very good &mdash;  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gallup </a>  says 87% of the global workforce is actually disengaged. When it comes to improving the work environment, companies are missing the mark. They&rsquo;re overspending in all the wrong places. And because there&rsquo;s no improvement in engagement, employees resort to quitting.</p><h3> <strong>  Current Cost of Turnover </strong></h3><p> <br/> The cost of an employee walking out the door is frightening. Check out what this report by TalentWise uncovered:</p><p> When an employee walks out the door, they&rsquo;re taking 70% of their knowledge with them</p><p> And there&rsquo;s no way to recover that knowledge. An employee becomes more valuable over time in the sense that they become experts at their positions. They understand their daily responsibilities like the back of their hand and can get through them in the most efficient way possible. But when this person leaves, all of that experience leaves with them.</p><h3> <strong>  Current Cost of Recruitment </strong></h3><p> <br/> Aside from losing valuable knowledge, companies will also take a huge financial hit while they hunt for a replacement and bring them on board. A study by Columbia University revealed that replacing a lost employee costs 150% of that person&rsquo;s annual salary. Not to mention, there are other factors that you have to consider:</p><li> Advertising job openings</li><li> Screening a candidate</li><li> Cost of onboarding</li><li> Lost productivity <br/>  </li><p> Recruitment is also expensive! Considering all of the costs that go into recruitment and hiring, you&rsquo;d think there would be a simple solution to avoid this hot mess, right?</p><p> Of course. And this is where pulsing surveys come into play. The great advantage of this tool is that it can help managers uncover employee sentiment in real-time fashion.</p><h3> <strong>  Digging Beneath the Surface </strong></h3><p> <br/> Workplace sentiment can change at the drop of a hat. One week, someone can feel like they&rsquo;re on cloud nine, and the next, they could be down in the dumps. It&rsquo;s reality. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s pointless for leaders to wait 12 months for employee feedback. You never know when things can take a turn for the worse.</p><p> So instead of playing the waiting game, leaders need to be proactive. Sending out a survey once a week allows managers to stay in the loop with how their employees are feeling. Especially when these surveys are anonymous, people are more willing to unleash their concerns and frustrations.</p><p> An article by  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/201404/6-virtues-and-6-vices-venting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Psychology Today </a>  mentioned that unleashing frustrations has the power to restore the brain&rsquo;s equilibrium and allows people to think more logically. Thus, giving employees an outlet to do so will help them de-stress and let their voice be heard. Of course, the anonymity factor comforts them by keeping their identity hidden so they can avoid fearing any negative retribution.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Improving the Workplace Culture </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t fix what you don&rsquo;t measure. But you also can&rsquo;t simply just send out a survey and hope for the best. It&rsquo;s not a magical cure. If you really want to improve your employee retention strategy, you&rsquo;ll need to commit to acting on the feedback. This is the ideal way to show your employees that their opinions matter and you actually care about creating an environment where they can thrive in.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t just give the leadership team access to the feedback results. Share them with your organization to get their minds ticking about solutions. This brings the employee into the decision-making process. So instead of only letting managers and supervisors be responsible for improving the culture, you&rsquo;re empowering employees to improve their own work culture.</p><p> As this study by  <a href=\"http://dupress.com/articles/employee-engagement-culture-human-capital-trends-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Deloitte </a>  points out:  &ldquo;Although culture and engagement play such a critical role in business performance, most organizations do a poor job of measuring their achievements or shortcomings. Historically, companies have relied on annual engagement surveys, often costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and taking months to deploy. And very few companies have a process or tools to measure culture and learn where it is strong, weak, or inconsistent. At a time when corporate cultures are being continuously debated, shaped, and redefined on social networks, the once-a-year survey is perilously obsolete.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Saving the Bank </strong></h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve already mentioned the high cost of turnover and recruitment. So how do pulsing surveys really save organizations money? Well, for starters, you&rsquo;re uncovering issues and finding solutions before things go awry. Basically, you&rsquo;re nipping the problem right in the bud.</p><p> If an employee is unhappy with how transparent their manager is or they&rsquo;re starting to feel burnt out, you don&rsquo;t want to wait 12 months for them to speak up. Within those 12 months, they could be long gone. Leaders can use pulsing surveys to measure how the work culture is performing and how well their employees are engaged.

As Bill Nye said, the great thing about it is that it&rsquo;s true, whether you believe it or not. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so excited about the new research showing that our decisions are guided by emotions in ways we never imagined. This has the potential to completely revolutionize the way we think about customer service. </p><p> What did you have for breakfast? Maybe you had an apple because you want to be healthy. The fact that choosing healthy food makes you feel good about yourself helps harden that choice into habit. You stick with apples because you know they will reliably make you feel good about the way you start your day. </p><p> Though you may think you&rsquo;re being responsible in your decision-making, it&rsquo;s more likely that you&rsquo;re responding to emotional cues that inspire you to feel positive.</p><p> Comparing your breakfast choice to a customer&rsquo;s purchase decision isn&rsquo;t comparing apples and oranges. Customers with positive associations with a brand will spend  <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2012/10/expanded-version.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  up to 200% more </a>  and will also tell an average of eight friends about them. </p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the science of decision making, shall we? </p><h3> <b>  The Science of Decision Making </b></h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1008328\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Antonio Damasio </a>  is a professor of neuroscience who literally wrote the book on how emotions guide decisions. His work is really inspirational because his main ideas are directly applicable to customer service. They are:</p><li> <i>  Emotions guide decisions </i> : While we like to think of ourselves as logical beings, it is actually our emotions that inspire our decisions.</li><li> <i>  Positive associations lead to repeat decisions </i> : When someone makes a decision that leads to a positive outcome, they are more likely to make the same decision in the future.</li><li> <i>  Without emotions, there are no decisions </i> : If a person has no emotional connection to the outcome of a decision, they are less likely to actually make a decision.</li><p>  </p><p> Jennifer Lerner is another scientist who is pioneering with research on this topic. Lerner has differentiated between two types of emotions in the decision making process: Integral Emotions and Incidental Emotions. </p><li> <i>  Integral Emotions </i> : Emotions that arise from the actual decision at hand.</li><li> <i>  Incidental Emotions </i> : Emotions that carry over from one decision to the next and influence our decisions in the future.</li><p> <br/> So, not only are emotions important for each decision in the present time, those emotions carry into the future and continue to be influential, whether they are positive or negative. </p><p> <i>  The bottom line </i> : Human beings make decisions based on emotions, not logic. Decisions that generate positive emotions are more likely to be repeated. At the same time, both positive and negative emotions arising from decisions made in the present remain relevant in the future, affecting the way we make decisions about situations that may have little to do with the initial situation. </p><p> All of this suggests that the way customers feel is of the utmost importance, not just today, but for the entire customer life cycle. And since satisfaction is more neutral than positive, it is no longer enough for brands to simply satisfy customers. </p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <b>  Emotions in Customer Service </b></h3><p> <br/> What does the science of emotions and decision-making have to do with customer service? Everything. Think about it. Any time a customer interacts with a brand, positive or negative emotions can be inspired. The most successful brands are those that can inspire positive emotions more often than negative emotions. This leads to more customer satisfaction, increased loyalty, and greater word of mouth.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve detailed six core emotions in customer service. Surprise, happiness, and gratitude are the most common positive emotions a customer can feel. Anger, frustration, and disappointment are on the negative side of the spectrum. If brands can continually inspire positive emotions in their customers, they are well on their way to success. </p><p> That&rsquo;s easier said than done, but it&rsquo;s certainly achievable if you know enough about your customers. This is where technology becomes crucial. By learning more about your customers, not only through their previous interactions with the brand but also by what they post and how they interact on social media and digital channels, technology can match customer together with the best customer service agent for them. </p><p> But knowledge about the customer continues to be invaluable, even after the customer has been routed to the best agent. Contact centers that know more about their customers -- their needs, their hobbies, their likes and dislikes, even their sense of humor -- have the knowledge they need to surprise and delight customers, thus leading to the pinnacle of customer emotion, gratitude. </p><p> <i>  Advanced technology is the key to this goal </i> . With the right  <a href=\"http://www.brandembassy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  social customer service software </a> , each and every customer service agent can have a more complete picture of each customer, thus paving the way for real human connections. That&rsquo;s the future of customer service, and it&rsquo;s already beginning to happen as more brands realize the power and importance of customer experience.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-10 18:18:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-10 18:18:38.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_b69Ve36.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-emotions-impact-customer-experience/\", \"post_id\": \"12362\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-10 18:18:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-10 18:18:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-emotions-impact-customer-experience\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12361\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6006\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/How-Emotions-Impact-Customer-Experience.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"530\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468263600,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

Apparently we can be talked into almost anything, especially if you package it up real nice and surround it with a healthy dose of PR spin. It&rsquo;s why we do dopey things like walk bare footed on hot coals or pay hefty prices for programs that are mostly smoke and mirrors. We want to prove to ourselves (and others) that we are smart, successful and in-the-know.</p><p> But here&rsquo;s the thing: there are two, sometimes opposing, forces going on in your brain. Your emotional brain and your intellectual brain&mdash;you know, the feeling part vs the knowing part. Adding one more dash of confusion to the mixture is your hardwired opinion of the &ldquo;rightness&rdquo; of your decision-making. You obviously believe that you&rsquo;re making the right decision for the right reason&mdash;otherwise, you wouldn&rsquo;t do it. The problem is just because you believe something is true doesn&rsquo;t make it so.</p><p> It&rsquo;s like buying a stock that you believe will rise in value&mdash;if you didn&rsquo;t believe that you certainly wouldn&rsquo;t put your hard earned cash on the table. But that belief just doesn&rsquo;t make it so.</p><p> It&rsquo;s like living on credit card debt on the brink of insolvency without making any changes to your life and just believing it will all turn out all right. Yet, each decision to spend adds to your stress and money misery.</p><p> Does that mean that everyone who picks a stock that loses money or lives on credit cards is stupid? No, of course not. But it does clearly demonstrate that our reasoning is not foolproof and our decision-making is flawed by its very nature. We see the world through the lenses of our beliefs (also known as confirmation bias), yet without testing those beliefs, we are destined to make mistake after mistake and experience disaster after disaster.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> We are great self-justifiers. Why else would people willingly take their shoes off and walk on hot coals? In this case, they have rationalized their decision because someone they respect told them they could do it, logic be damned! It&rsquo;s the same in your financial life. If you buy an investment believing it will rise&mdash;and it doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;you can always develop a reason why it failed. It&rsquo;s not your thinking, but some other force in the Universe that changed the game on your otherwise perfectly conceived plan. Maybe it was Brexit or some idiot in the Middle East who opened the valves on oil production&hellip;</p><p> So here you are, guilty of being human. Suffering from the same condition to which we are all subject: believing what we believe. Instead of falling for that, you can apply some healthy skepticism and take the time to consider the factors and consequences that might not be readily apparent.

{"original_id":5771,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Thoughtfully and Carefully Crafting a Retainer to Grow Your Business?","link":"are-you-thoughtfully-and-carefully-crafting-a-retainer-to-grow-your-business","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> When you&rsquo;re running a consulting or advisory business, a handful of stellar retainer clients can change your life. <br/>  </h3><p> You can concentrate on producing big results without constantly chasing new clients or new projects.</p><p> You can hire associates and leverage your business.</p><p> Your banker takes your calls.</p><p> Or those same retainers can be the kiss of death.</p><p> Think broken promises (doesn&rsquo;t everyone have at least one nightmare retainer story?), lost revenue, frustrated consultants and messy client relationships.</p><p> So should you really work on retainer?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s start with this:</p><p> A retainer is a fixed monthly fee in exchange for a service. That service can be expressed as hours (effort), deliverables or results.</p><p> Many freelancers define their retainers in terms of hours&mdash;$2,500 a month for 10 hours&mdash;and discount their hourly rate in exchange for fixed revenue. FYI&mdash;this may work fine in the beginning to build your client base, but beware of tying yourself completely to exchanging hours for money.</p><p> Another option is to tie your retainer to deliverables&mdash;mini-projects that you can do on an ongoing or perhaps rotating basis. The marketing consultant who writes monthly blog posts or the technology wizard that monitors websites can create retainers tied to their production.</p><p> The holy grail for clients&mdash;when it&rsquo;s almost impossible to say no to a retainer&mdash;is when you can tie it to a high-value result. That can look like outsourcing a worry (I&rsquo;ll handle all your HR questions) to expediting strategy (I&rsquo;ll train/coach your leadership team on this new technology).</p><p> Whether you should work on retainer depends on your business/revenue model, your sweet spot clients and the work you do that most moves the needle for them.</p><p> Start by looking at the clients where can you create win-win opportunities with some version of a retainer.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve identified some possibilities, ask yourself these questions before pursuing it further with your client(s).</p><p> Is this someone I trust? Well-designed retainers will bring you closer to your client. To allow you the freedom to dig deeper and serve in ways that one-off projects or bill-by-the-hour arrangements rarely permit. So if your client has questionable ethics or is a slow payer or just not in your true sweet-spot, a retainer is a bad idea. It&rsquo;s also not the place to experiment with a new client&mdash;earned mutual trust and respect is the price of admission.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> What do I want to accomplish with this arrangement? Absolute clarity is your wisest option. Maybe your goal is to lock in a portion of your schedule (to give you freedom to experiment elsewhere) or have firm client commitments that allow you to hire the support you need to grow. Because retainer discussions can take off in a direction you might not anticipate, it&rsquo;s vital to stay connected to your purpose.</p><p> What&rsquo;s the right scope? Define the presenting issue from your client&rsquo;s perspective. What vexing problems can you solve? Can you translate that into a line-of-sight set of bullet points that tie what they need to what you have to offer? It&rsquo;s tempting to closely scope retainers&mdash;that&rsquo;s where those banks of hours proposals come from&mdash;but sometimes opening up and being generous is the better way to build the relationship. Just work in a review process so both parties can adjust the work and/or fees as you build your experience together.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> What do I need to make this work? Before you broach the topic with your client, be sure you know the boundaries of your own needs. If you&rsquo;re promising to produce content for example, will you do it all yourself or will you need to contract some out? How much of your time will it take to review someone else&rsquo;s work? Will your contractors work within the rates you&rsquo;ve set and will your margin be sufficient to pay for your effort?</p><p> And finally, just a few more nuggets about setting up retainers.</p><li> After your discussions with the client, put it all in writing, confirming your deal: deliverables, timing, result, payments, terms.</li><li> Resist the temptation to build unreasonable (or downright scary) demands into the fine print. Like this one I was given recently: &ldquo;The parties hereto hereby agree that during the term of this engagement and after the termination of this agreement, for a period of no less than 2 years, neither party [nor their employees, principals and managers] shall make any negative comments of any nature whatsoever, about the other party.&rdquo; Yep, we took a pass.</li><li> Give both parties a 30-day out clause. This allows you to exit gracefully if it&rsquo;s not working and it gives you some notice if your client changes their mind.</li><li> Consider if you&rsquo;ll need to require advance scheduling notice for certain services.</li><li> Track your time for each retainer, even if the agreement doesn&rsquo;t revolve around it. Because you want to know how the terms are working for you at all times. And if you do build your deal around hours, never ever roll unused hours into the next month. That encourages sloppy practices&mdash;your goal is to keep engaged and active on the account.</li><li> Build in quarterly reviews (at least). While projects have clear milestones, retainers can easily fall into a rut. Use the retainer as an excuse to discuss your progress on your client&rsquo;s drivers.</li><p> Yes, retainers can work beautifully as a springboard to grow your business. Just craft them thoughtfully and tend to them carefully.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-11 14:58:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-11 14:58:35.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_eZNQqsw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-thoughtfully-and-carefully-crafting-a-retainer-to-grow-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"12371\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-11 14:58:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-11 14:58:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-thoughtfully-and-carefully-crafting-a-retainer-to-grow-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12370\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6010\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Are-You-Thoughtfully-and-Carefully-Crafting-a-Retainer-to-Grow-Your-Business.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"773\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468335600,"author_id":407,"chart_url":""}

What happens when your clients are happy, but you&rsquo;re questioning whether you&rsquo;re in the right place to best serve both your needs and theirs? How do you even contemplate replacing your current business card with a new one?</p><p> The changing regulatory environment, coupled by firm consolidation, has made the financial advisory business more complicated than ever, leaving many advisors frustrated and questioning whether they have a future at their current firm. Frustrations among advisors vary, with some rooted in the day-to-day while others go a bit deeper and pose a conflict to the advisor&rsquo;s core philosophy. And while that variance causes a range of discontent among advisors, their own responsible efforts with their clients mask their frustrations.</p><p> So, while you&rsquo;re helping your clients reach their dreams, is there a cost to sacrificing your own personal happiness and, could that inevitably impact your ability to serve clients and grow your business?</p><p> Living a life that is congruent with your values and beliefs creates a state of integrity and a sense of harmony. In fact, there&rsquo;s often a feeling of intrinsic trust that comes from someone who&rsquo;s acting in accordance with who they are and what they believe in. Trust, technical competence, experience and knowledge are the foundation for the advisor-client relationship and given financial services has morphed from an industry driven by product to one defined by advice, client satisfaction likely has more to do with the advisor than the firm he or she works for.</p><p> Then, what happens when an advisor feels that their firm&rsquo;s policies are not congruent with their core values and beliefs? Can that feeling of incongruence and discontent trickle down to the client and, what&rsquo;s the overall impact on the business?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> In our experience, advisors are masterful when it comes to insulating their clients from their frustrations, and while many of the minor annoyances that plague them on a daily basis may not directly impact their clients, maintaining the status quo requires an enormous amount of energy and impacts overall productivity. If your values clash with those of your firm, the authenticity of the message that you&rsquo;re delivering to clients and prospects will likely be diminished.</p><p> Unfortunately, many people live a life that is not congruent with who they are and what they believe because they fear the consequences that may result from making a change. Staying the course is indeed the path of least resistance and will require adjusting one&rsquo;s expectations and attitude. You can accept the frustrations and continue to grow the business in spite of them. On the other hand, some advisors may opt to reclaim their place in the driver&rsquo;s seat and will find the courage to tell clients that while they have been happy, you have not been and it is your belief that they would be better served by you taking their business elsewhere.</p><p> Operating consistently from a trusted position with your clients often results in a relationship where that trust is returned. Rely on the trust that your clients have in you and &ndash; provided that you are acting from a place of truth, integrity and a sense of what&rsquo;s right &ndash; you&rsquo;re likely to chart a path that is accretive to both you and your clients; one in which everyone&rsquo;s happy in the end.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-11 15:03:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-11 15:03:09.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_p0Lc2ya.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-happens-when-your-clients-are-happy-but-you-are-not/\", \"post_id\": \"12373\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-11 15:03:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-11 15:03:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-happens-when-your-clients-are-happy-but-you-are-not\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12372\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6011\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-Happens-When-Your-Clients-Are-Happy-but-You-Are-Not_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"673\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468321200,"author_id":133,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5773,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"U.S. Homeowners Among 4 Big Winners to Emerge from Brexit","link":"u-s-homeowners-among-4-big-winners-to-emerge-from-brexit","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Last week my friend John Mauldin, chairman of Mauldin Economics, released a special Brexit edition of his popular investments newsletter Outside the Box. In it he shared a post written by geopolitical strategist George Friedman that describes a recent meeting among six foreign ministers representing the European Union&rsquo;s founding member states: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The topic of discussion was the possible causes and implications of the U.K.&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.</p><p> What George finds extraordinary is that, in their follow-up statement, the ministers appear to capitulate, admitting they &ldquo;recognize different levels of ambition amongst Member States when it comes to the project of European integration.&rdquo;</p><p> As George puts it, this is their way of acknowledging&mdash;finally?&mdash;the impossible task of enforcing uniformity across the European continent, home to many different peoples and cultures, all with different goals and aspirations.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If nothing else, this alone should be seen as a positive consequence of Brexit. It&rsquo;s too early to tell what direction the EU will take post-Brexit, or whether any material policy changes will be made, but it seems as if the cries of resentment and frustration that have risen up from England and Wales (and, to a lesser extent, Scotland and Northern Ireland) have not fallen on deaf ears.</p><p> This is precisely what I&rsquo;ve been writing about the last few weeks. If you&rsquo;ve been following the mainstream media&rsquo;s coverage of Brexit, you might think it&rsquo;s little more than a reactionary, anti-immigrant groundswell. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong&mdash;immigration is certainly part of it. Trying to integrate 333,000 people a year into the country&rsquo;s national health care and school system has pushed the bandwidth of the British economy.</p><p> But the U.K.&rsquo;s grievances&mdash;some of which I discussed in previous commentaries&mdash;are much more varied than that. And following the historic referendum, EU bureaucrats seem to be taking the gripes seriously, which we can count as a win not just for the U.K. but other member states as well.</p><h3> Below are four more winners to have emerged from Brexit: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Gold Investors <br/>  </h3><p> The day after the referendum, gold jumped nearly 5 percent and since then has held above $1,300 an ounce, helping to achieve its best first half of the year since 1974. The yellow metal, which has historically been sought by investors during times of political and economic uncertainty, is also strengthening now that a U.S. interest rate hike seems less and less likely post-Brexit.</p><p> Markets, in fact, seem to have completely shed any belief that the Federal Reserve will raise rates this year. Bets that rates will be cut by September spiked before retreating, while bets that they would be left untouched surged 48.6 percent.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bets-on-Fed-Rate-Cuts-Surge-Post-Brexit.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> This bodes well for gold, which has traditionally shared an inverse relationship with interest rates. When savings account rates and yields on government bonds are low, gold suddenly becomes much more attractive to hold as a store of value.</p><p> This is especially true in countries where rates are negative. The yield on the German 10-year Bund recently fell below zero, and the Swiss 30-year government bond yield turned negative, in effect charging investors for the privilege of holding their cash.</p><p> But American investors aren&rsquo;t immune. Last Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to as low as 1.385 percent, an all-time record.</p><p> Across the pond, British rates are likely to be slashed this summer, according to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. In response, Britain&rsquo;s FTSE 100 Index roared up to a 10-month high, erasing all Brexit-inflicted losses.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/British-stocks-quickly-rebound-to-pre-brexit-levels.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><h3> 2. U.S. Homeowners <br/>  </h3><p> The promise of continued low rates in Brexit&rsquo;s wake could be good news for U.S. homeowners, both current and potential. For the week ended June 24, the mortgage rate on a 30-year home loan fell to 3.75 percent, its lowest level since May 2013, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Some analysts are even forecasting mortgage rates&mdash;which tend to track 10-year Treasury yields&mdash;to sink to record lows in the coming weeks. This move is expected to spur a wave of new loan applications and refinancing as borrowers rush to lock in historically low rates.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"361\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/US-Home-Prices-Soar-Mortgage-Rates-Fall.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Home prices in the U.S., meanwhile, continue to improve after the financial crisis. Prices advanced 5 percent year-over-year in April, according to new data from the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Prices Indices. The 20-City Composite Index, in fact, is back up to its winter 2007 level.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 3. British Luxury Goods Makers <br/>  </h3><p> In the immediate aftermath of the U.K. referendum, Donald Trump suggested the pound&rsquo;s dramatic decline could encourage more foreign tourists to visit Turnberry, Scotland, where he owns a luxury golf resort. Many in the media criticized him for the comment, arguing he seems to care only about how he might profit from Brexit. But the thing is, he&rsquo;s right.</p><p> Because of the drop in the pound, which sent it to levels not seen in more than 30 years, U.S. and Chinese interest in travel to Britain has already seen a huge spike. This could be a potential windfall for Britain&rsquo;s luxury goods industry, which posted sales averaging nearly $1 billion in 2014, according to advisory firm Deloitte. Clothing designer Burberry, Britain&rsquo;s largest luxury company, could end up being a beneficiary, along with many other major European brands found in the U.K.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"288\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Weak-Pound-Seen-Benefiting-British-Luxury-Goods-Companies.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> I&rsquo;ve mentioned before how Chinese tourists spend more than any other country&rsquo;s. Now, a March report by the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) found that in 2015, outbound Chinese travelers shelled out a massive $215 billion overseas, representing an increase of 53 percent from the previous year. A weakened pound should only intensify demand even more.</p><h3> 4. British Taxpayers <br/>  </h3><p> According to the Daily Express, about 10,000 Brussels-based bureaucrats earn more than&mdash;and in many cases, more than twice as much as&mdash;U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, who has a gross annual salary of 142,500 pounds. What&rsquo;s more, they pay the euro equivalent of 50,000 pounds less per year than Cameron does. And before the 2015 Christmas break, these Eurocrats, who all enjoy a final salary pension, just gave themselves a 2.4 percent raise.</p><p> The British referendum was in large part a rejection of this brand of elitism. Similar to what many Americans feel today, taxpayers in the U.K. are fed up with seeing their money leave the British shores only to line the pockets of unelected officials, with little to show for it in return.</p><p> The two-year transition period that follows will likely present many challenges, but in the long run, an independent Britain will be able to set its own immigration policies, impose its own rules and regulations, negotiate the terms of its own trade agreements and much more.</p><p> Note: A correction was made July 7 regarding immigration figures.</p><p> All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice.

{"original_id":5774,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Case for Managing Financial Clients Rather Than Their Assets","link":"the-case-for-managing-financial-clients-rather-than-their-assets","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Eamon Porter</p><h3> Financial history is peppered with stock market crashes, property market booms and busts and a vast array of stories of individuals who have either made or lost fortunes, or even both. <br/>  </h3><p> Irrespective of the past, a financial adviser deals with the here and now as well as the future, keeping one eye on clients&rsquo; possible expenditure requirements. In doing this, giving the right advice is a subjective process in terms of possible investment portfolio construction and asset mix or promoting beneficial financial habits. Irrespective of the type of client or their individual requirements, the adviser&rsquo;s methodology in giving financial advice needs to be robust, easily understood and capable of consistent application.</p><p> In the investment arena, many clients find stock markets and matters such as asset allocation and volatility complex or even scary. A common experience of most investment advisers is that even when the client confirms verbally that they understood an investment concept that has just been explained to them, true understanding usually requires the explanation to be repeated several times before the issue is grasped.</p><p> In order to simplify matters, many investment advisers have, by and large, focused historically on fund selection and objective matching. While this is understandable to a certain extent, it is also dilutes the skill necessary to advise clients and risks falling into the trap of letting investment advice be led by the most convenient product or &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; fund being marketed by an investment manager. Hindsight is wonderful, but replicating the investment choices that have performed best in the recent past does not guarantee future success. This lemming-like behaviour has led to housing bubbles and the dot.com crash, to name but two. Simplification can also lead to oversights such as a failure to recognise the impact of inflation or the effect of taxation on investment growth.</p><p> Any document dealing with investment risk needs to acknowledge the trade-off between investment return and the possibility of loss together with ongoing volatility, especially with asset classes that experience wide variations in pricing. While the concept of the Efficient Frontier is a familiar one with experienced investment advisers, many clients interpret the drawing of such a graph as almost a guaranteed level of performance without realising that losses can and do occur.</p><p> Risk profiling is possibly the single most important regulatory issue facing investment advisers and financial institutions at this time, as the consequences of getting it wrong or even not doing it can be severe for both investor and adviser. Getting it right confers major benefits, for example, by allowing diversification to dilute risk or identifying when to stretch investors to go beyond their usual comfort zone and take slightly more risk needed to meet goals.</p><p> In recent years, especially in the UK, there has been a steady growth in advisers&rsquo; use of investor risk profiling tools provided by investment companies. These alone, however, are not silver bullets for defining risk, despite the encouragement by such companies who have a vested interest in providing the shortest possible route to a client selecting their investment funds. All of this assumes, of course, that these profiling systems have been constructed correctly and are properly validated.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The traditional understanding of risk is, however, only half the picture. By solely focusing on investment return, investors and their advisers ignore the reason for investment return, namely the satisfying of a need for capital growth. Such a need is based around a future requirement for expenses to be met, especially those that are based in the reality of current needs. This also means that a client&rsquo;s current financial behaviour needs to be addressed. Such behaviours include blind purchasing by clients of financial products other than investments as well as overreaching in borrowings. Similarly, spendthrift behaviour merely because cashflow is available is not a sustainable long-term financial behaviour. Nevertheless, not only can clients lose the run of themselves but advisers who fail to advise these clients otherwise could lead to such behaviour being interpreted as acceptable and in some way a part of their future financial planning approach.</p><p> The spectre of financial risk is also present in the need to purchase life assurance, income protection or specified illness cover. Maintaining these safeguards requires that a person remain solvent and have access to cash, both of which can be influenced by arbitrary decisions on the part of the individual, many of which are emotionally driven.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> The acknowledgement of risks other than the traditional views of investment risk is key to good financial planning. Even more important is the education of clients in such regard. Individuals can, and do, become blinded to the possibility of future financial loss due to steep rises in interest rates on large loan portfolios in periods of economic success. Similarly, a lifestyle that has been funded by the existence of easy credit through credit cards, overdrafts or interest-only borrowings has led, post-Lehmans and other similar circumstances, to personal financial destruction. If financial education is only acquired through personal losses in the troughs of economic cycles rather than through an understanding of these cycles and a long-term perspective, the possibility of financial recovery may be rather slim.</p><p> What financial planners need to recognise is that they are primarily investor managers as opposed to investment managers and client leaders rather than product sellers. Such leadership has been severely lacking as, in many instances in the past, advisers sought to take shortcuts to generate business income without necessarily examining the true emotional makeup of their clients and the financial impact of such clients&rsquo; natural preferences in dealing with money. This misdirected advice has, in turn, had serious consequences on the long-term relationship with the clients.</p><p> In fairness, the financial services industry has historically veered towards defining and managing risk as being investment related. Such an approach was easy to rationalise, and led to the design of easily marketable products which suited those businesses that relied on earnings from annual management charges from investment funds.</p><p> The realms of individual financial planning do not, unfortunately, fit easily into systemised investment marketing and, traditionally, what does not fit is usually ignored for the sake of profitable expediency. To be an excellent financial planner not only requires product knowledge and an ability to analyse but also a willingness to spend more time getting to know the client, which leads to an understanding of and empathy for the client, rather than focussing on the quick sale.</p><p> While &ldquo;knowing the client&rdquo; is a prerequisite by any financial regulatory code, too few advisers take the trouble to know the client from the inside out since to do so takes time and may create additional workload. Rather than looking at such &ldquo;work&rdquo; as a negative, it should be viewed as a key building block in not only providing the right understanding of the clients&rsquo; needs, financial and emotional, but also in establishing long-term successful business relationships for the adviser. By understanding clients on a personal level rather than just viewing them in terms of a financial fact find or an investment profile, the relationship strengthens as does the likelihood that the client will respond positively to any advice given. This can only help to ensure that a long-term business relationship will develop and thrive beyond any short term product sale.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-11 15:16:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-11 15:16:28.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_vSingCO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-case-for-managing-financial-clients-rather-than-their-assets/\", \"post_id\": \"12381\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-11 15:16:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-11 15:16:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-case-for-managing-financial-clients-rather-than-their-assets\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12380\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6013\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Case-for-Managing-Financial-Clients-Rather-Than-Their-Assets.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"560\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468317600,"author_id":199,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5775,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Natural Tendencies That Make Formulating Good Decisions Very Difficult","link":"5-natural-tendencies-that-make-formulating-good-decisions-very-difficult","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ChunkaMui\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Chunka Mui </a></p><p> Business is a contact sport. Some companies win, while others lose. That won&rsquo;t change. There is no way to guarantee success. Make the best decisions you can, then fight the battle in the marketplace.</p><p> Yet research into more than 2,500 large corporate failures that Paul Carroll and I did found that many big decisions are doomed as they come off the drawing board&mdash;before first contact with the competition. Why?</p><p> The short answer is that humans are far from rational in their planning and decision-making. Psychological and anthropological studies going back decades, including those of Solomon Asch, Stanley Milgram, Irving Janis, Donald Brown and, more recently, Dan Ariely, consistently demonstrate that even the smartest among us face huge impediments when making complicated decisions, such as those involved in setting strategy.</p><p> In other words, humans are hard-wired to come up with bad decisions. Formulating good ones is very difficult because of five natural tendencies:</p><h3> 1. Fallacious assumptions <br/>  </h3><p> If &ldquo;point of view is worth 80 IQ points,&rdquo; as Alan Kay says, people often start out in a deep hole.</p><p> One problem is the anchoring bias, where we subconsciously tend to work from whatever spreadsheet, forecast or other formulation we&rsquo;re presented. We tend to tinker rather than question whether the assumptions are right or the ideas are even worth considering. Even when we know a situation requires more sophisticated analysis, it&rsquo;s hard for us to dislodge the anchors.</p><p> Another strike against expansive thinking is what psychologists call the survivorship bias: We remember what happened; we don&rsquo;t remember what didn&rsquo;t happen. We are encouraged to take risks in business, because we read about those who made &ldquo;bet the company&rdquo; decisions and reaped fortunes&mdash;and don&rsquo;t read about those who never quite made the big time because they made &ldquo;bet the company&rdquo; decisions and lost.</p><h3> 2. Premature closure <br/>  </h3><p> People home in on an answer prematurely, long before we evaluate all information.</p><p> We get a first impression of an idea in much the same way we get a first impression of a person. Even when people are trained to withhold judgment, they find themselves evaluating information as they go along, forming a tentative conclusion early in the process. Premature conclusions, like first impressions, are hard to reverse.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> A study of analysts in the intelligence community, for instance, found that, despite their extensive training, analysts tended to come to a conclusion very quickly and then &ldquo;fit the facts&rdquo; to that conclusion. A study of clinical psychologists found that they formed diagnoses relatively rapidly and that additional information didn&rsquo;t improve those diagnoses.</p><h3> 3. Confirmation bias <br/>  </h3><p> Once people start moving toward an answer, they look to confirm that their answer is right, rather than hold open the possibility that they&rsquo;re wrong.</p><p> Although science is supposed to be the most rational of endeavors, it constantly demonstrates confirmation bias. Ian Mitroff&rsquo;s The Subjective Side of Science shows at great length how scientists who had formulated theories about the origins of the Moon refused to capitulate when the moon rocks brought back by Apollo 11 disproved their theories; the scientists merely tinkered with their theories to try to skirt the new evidence.</p><p> Max Planck, the eminent physicist, said scientists never do give up their biases, even when they are discredited. The scientists just slowly die off, making room for younger scientists, who didn&rsquo;t grow up with the errant biases. Planck could just as easily have been describing most business people.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4. Groupthink <br/>  </h3><p> People conform to the wishes of the group, especially if there is a strong person in the leadership role, rather than ask tough questions.</p><p> Our psyches lead us to go along with our peers and to conform, in particular, to the wishes of authority figures. Numerous psychological experiments show that humans will go along with the group to surprising degrees.</p><p> From a business standpoint, ample research, supported by numerous examples, suggest that even senior executives, as bright and decisive as they typically are, may value their standing with their peers and bosses so highly that they&rsquo;ll bend to the group&rsquo;s wishes&mdash;especially when the subject is complicated and the answers aren&rsquo;t clear, as is always the case in strategy setting.</p><h3> 5. Failure to learn from past mistakes <br/>  </h3><p> People tend to explain away their mistakes rather than to acknowledge their errors, making it impossible to learn from them.</p><p> Experts are actually more likely to suffer from overconfidence than the rest of the world. After all, they&rsquo;re experts. Studies have found that people across all cultures tend to think highly of themselves even if they shouldn&rsquo;t. They also blame problems on bad luck rather than take responsibility and learn from failures. Our rivals may succeed through good luck, but not us. We earned our way to the top.</p><p> While it&rsquo;s been widely found that some 70% of corporate takeovers hurt the stock-market value of the acquiring company, studies find that roughly three-quarters of executives report that takeovers they were involved in had been successes.</p><p> The really aware decision makers (the sort who read articles like this one) realize the limitations they face. So, they redouble their efforts, insisting on greater vigilance and deeper analysis.</p><p> The problem is that that isn&rsquo;t enough. As the long history of corporate failures show, vigilant and analytical executives can still come up with demonstrably bad strategies.</p><p> The solution is not to just be more careful. Accept that the tendency toward decision-making errors is deeply ingrained and adopt devil&rsquo;s advocates and other explicit mechanisms to counter those tendencies.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-11 15:24:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-11 15:24:03.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_dXPVp0O.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-natural-tendencies-that-make-formulating-good-decisions-very-difficult/\", \"post_id\": \"12383\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-11 15:24:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-11 15:24:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-natural-tendencies-that-make-formulating-good-decisions-very-difficult\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12382\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6014\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-Natural-Tendencies-That-Make-Formulating-Good-Decisions-Very-Difficult.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"660\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468346400,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5776,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Moneyball Approach to Deliver a Smarter ETF","link":"a-moneyball-approach-to-deliver-a-smarter-etf","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Moneyball may have missed out on winning Best Picture at the Oscars a few years back, but the story of how Billy Beane changed baseball by using statistical analysis to predict tomorrow&rsquo;s big winners is every numbers-geek&rsquo;s dream. And it has more to do with the success of your clients&rsquo; portfolios than you might think. <br/>  </h3><p> Billy Beane&rsquo;s goal was to build a winning team by using statistical data to pick players who can do just one thing: get on base and score runs. As an advisor, your goal isn&rsquo;t much different. You look at each client&rsquo;s specific needs, and then put together a portfolio designed to achieve their goals. Of course, in today&rsquo;s volatile market environment, managing risk and building the &lsquo;right&rsquo; portfolio is harder than ever. If your client has a long time horizon ahead, the challenge is minimal. But what about retirees whose portfolios can&rsquo;t afford another downswing in the market? And what if their time horizon is so short that a high level of liquidity is an absolute must?</p><p> Just like in Moneyball, the answer sits smack in the middle of the numbers. By looking at the data differently&mdash;and looking at different data&mdash;it&rsquo;s possible to apply a traditional investment concept in a whole new way. The tool? The fixed income ETF. The difference? By taking a fresh approach to evaluating and benchmarking bonds, fixed-income ETFs seek to take the guesswork out of bond selection.</p><p> But wait. Let me jump back. It&rsquo;s not even the seventh inning yet and I&rsquo;m way ahead of myself. First let&rsquo;s look at what has, for some, has made ETFs feel all too risky as a solution for the investors who need them most: older retirees.</p><li> First, the traditional ETF ratings system is almost like old-world baseball scouts. Agencies sometimes focus on past performance rather than future benefit. By looking backward instead of forward, you could fail to look at the single most important factor in a bond&rsquo;s level of risk: each entity&rsquo;s ability to pay existing bonds in the future. Add in reporting delays, political influences, and industry pressures, and it&rsquo;s clear these ratings are far from perfect.</li><li> Second, the benchmarking system&mdash;specifically the practice of benchmarking against common benchmarks&mdash;is a problem. Some are made up of thousands of bonds to produce seemingly predictable measures, but many of those bonds are either not available for sale today or they&rsquo;re available only in small numbers and are inaccessible to investors. As a result, the data can be outdated. It&rsquo;s a situation that begs for a more reliable benchmark that applies to the real world.</li><li> Third, aside from the risk issues, most ETFs are just plain confusing. Every fund manager claims to have a &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; that makes their &ldquo;smart beta&rdquo; better than yesterday&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategic beta.&rdquo; Plus, while the funds themselves may be transparent, the processes used by the fund managers are not, making it difficult to downright impossible to complete due diligence or properly understand risk for every bond in each fund. So how do you even go about selecting the right fund for a specific client?</li><p> These are very real issues, and yet steering away from ETFs as a whole is a clear case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Luckily, there&rsquo;s a better way to take advantage of the benefits of fixed income ETFs. The solution is credit-scored index funds. Taking a lesson from Billy Beane, these funds rethink how bonds are rated, reevaluate how bonds are selected, and remove complexity to deliver a more passive, conservative, and consistent approach.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> They begin by rethinking the way bonds are rated. Bonds aren&rsquo;t ballplayers, but by throwing out the old ratings systems and instead taking an objective look at the credit score of each entity to determine their overall strength and how well each business is managed, it&rsquo;s much easier to assess and mitigate risk. Think of it like letting go of the star pitcher with the bad arm and a drinking problem to make room for a more consistent, reliable player. Less flash. More substance.</p><p> Rather than indexing a vast pool of unknown bonds, they include only real-world, investable bonds. Credit-scored ETFs are designed to support scalable, measurable portfolios, by using factual data, including management efficiency, profitability, and solvency to assess the quality of each issuer. Just like that, judgment calls based on theory are now decisions based on facts.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> And to keep it simple, there&rsquo;s no more &lsquo;secret sauce.&rsquo; Instead, the funds are driven by experienced asset managers using a consistent, passive approach based on the desired length of exposure for each fund. By using data to focus on quality over quantity fund managers can focus on the end game&mdash;and help you do the same for each of your clients.</p><p> Billy Beane transformed baseball by changing the way players were picked and winning teams were built by applying a statistical approach where it had never been applied before. The time has come to do the same for ETFs.

{"original_id":5777,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Help Set Goals! 7 Ways Leaders Can Survive a Collaboration","link":"help-set-goals-7-ways-leaders-can-survive-a-collaboration","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I&rsquo;ve heard the saying that &ldquo;collaboration is the new teamwork&rdquo; but what does that really mean? <br/>  </h3><p> Most of the workplaces I partner with contain many interconnected teams that live by their goals and deadlines. Each team is very focused, not always caring all that much about the individual team members or even about the other teams around them. As far as they are concerned, they have a job to do and there is no need to address their co-worker&rsquo;s particular frustrations or challenges.</p><p> Jennifer was one of those team members who was struggling. She was working to keep up with all the new excel programs and constantly lagged behind in her deliverables. As soon as she finally mastered one program, she was asked to move on and learn another. She felt that she would never catch up, as the team kept marching forward at a clip. Couldn&rsquo;t someone just stop for a moment and check-in with her about what she was having difficulty understanding? Didn&rsquo;t anyone care? How would she ever be able to collaborate effectively if she constantly felt behind?</p><h3> <strong>  How can leaders survive a collaboration when they feel they are constantly playing catch-up? </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  1.  </strong> <strong>  Ask for help </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> When leaders are drowning it is critical to reach out and ask for guidance and help. After trying to resolve our issues by ourselves, we need to recognize when it is time to say, &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t complete this without additional input from someone else.&rdquo; When we do meet with either a co-worker or boss, make sure to clarify what is being shared. Do not walk away from that meeting until you feel confident with a clear understanding of how to proceed forward.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Get to know the strengths of other team members </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Another empowering part of collaborating with others is identifying their strengths. This enables leaders to know whom to approach when they have a particular issue. In one manufacturing firm, one leader was struggling with a language barrier. They were able to overcome their miscommunication by including a team member who was fluent in both languages.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Keep everyone updated </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> When working with others it is so important to inform everyone on your progress or obstacles. One leader I helped was unaware that he was not sharing the big picture. The result was a slew of rumors circulating.</p><li> Set up check-ins for each piece of the deliverable you are working</li><li> Send information ahead to allow team members to think about how they will respond</li><li> Share all the information so others are not left in the dark with only partial facts</li><li> Be truthful</li><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  4. Roll up your sleeves </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Just as you may want co-workers to reach out when you are in trouble, make sure to provide help when those you are collaborating with need assistance. Be a leader that others feel they can approach and ask questions. Instead of judging when things don&rsquo;t fall in place, jump in and offer alternative ways to resolve a problem. Your perspective may open up doors of thinking.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Help set the goals </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Be part of the solution by helping the team to set the best goals. Develop SMART goals that reflect the direction everyone needs to move. Remember, make the goals- specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and with timeframes.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Spend extra time learning </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> If we run into a jam and need more time to understand a concept or process, put that on your calendar. Every leader digests information at a different pace, so be honest of your abilities and challenges. Only you know what is required to be the best contributor in a collaboration.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Speak up for others </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The best collaborators express their ideas clearly and respectfully, while still promoting the suggestions of team members.</p><li> Lead by recognizing the gifts of others</li><li> Lead by piggy-backing on what co-workers share</li><li> Lead by integrating the many opinions offered and evaluated</li><li> Lead by knowing that 1+1=3 is a true collaboration</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-11 15:46:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-11 15:46:44.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_rpM4Z4c.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/help-set-goals-7-ways-leaders-can-survive-a-collaboration/\", \"post_id\": \"12387\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-11 15:46:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-11 15:46:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"help-set-goals-7-ways-leaders-can-survive-a-collaboration\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12386\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6016\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Help-Set-Goals-7-Ways-Leaders-Can-Survive-a-Collaboration.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"639\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468350000,"author_id":476,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5778,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Financial Advisor Marketing Ideas That Build Brand Depth","link":"financial-advisor-marketing-ideas-that-build-brand-depth","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I just wanted to share what several people told me was an Aha-Moment while attending the RIA Summit, sponsored by Business Development Partners. My role at the summit was to meet with C-level executives from RIAs &ndash; RIAs managing at least one billion in client assets &mdash; and share my experience on building effective and profitable financial brands.  Financial advisor marketing ideas they can implement right away.</p><p> It was a bit of an eye opener for some. Although all the firms I met with would be considered successful (AUMs ranged from $1 to $10 billion) their brands ranged from extremely powerful and compelling to ineffective and non-existent. There was also a large range in the quality of their marketing.</p><p> There was however, one generally consistent and noticeably missing element &ndash; the aha moments &mdash; the lack of brand depth.</p><p> &ldquo;Brand depth&rdquo; can be defined as: the amount, scope and packaging of processes, philosophies, tools, and resources that bring the firm&rsquo;s brand to life. Essentially, a firm&rsquo;s brand depth is measured by their ability to validate and prove their advisor brand versus just talking about it.</p><p> The historical mindset has been, &ldquo;How do we say what we do differently than other firms?&rdquo; and the &ldquo;trick&rdquo; was to focus on witty catch phrases, and smoke &amp; mirrors marketing copy.</p><p> The challenge for a company like ours is that we get hired to make financial advisors sound better than others.</p><p> In reality, it&rsquo;s quite difficult to &ldquo;differentiate&rdquo; firms and professionals when everyone is singing from the same song sheet saying they offer independent, comprehensive, custom and tailored solutions to discerning investors and business owners.</p><p> The best opportunity to &ldquo;stand-out&rdquo; from the crowd these days is to showcase your advisor brand versus simply talking about how good and different your firm is. In other words &ndash; Prove it!</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> A decade and a half ago, TactiBrand used the following text on our website, &ldquo;The #1 marketing choice for financial professionals&rdquo;. These days, we don&rsquo;t bother trying to &ldquo;say&rdquo; we are great, we focus on proving it by making it as easy as possible for prospective financial firms to see what we do, experience (read, hear, watch, ponder, learn, and even feel) our branding processes and successes with a variety of free resources, bi-monthly blog posts, timely social updates, assessments and more.</p><p> This is also exactly what great financial firms need to focus on, how can they prove they are great versus using marketing razzle dazzle to tell a story that has little or no depth. Consumers have grown weary of being &ldquo;sold&rdquo; &ndash; they need to &ldquo;trust&rdquo; &ndash; they need to &ldquo;believe&rdquo;.</p><h3> Here are some financial advisor marketing ideas that build Brand Depth: <br/>  </h3><li> An easy to understand diagram of that explains and showcases your investment or client experience process/approach</li><li> A 90-second video that stirs emotion regarding your purpose and approach to serving your clients</li><li> Whitepapers that tell the story behind your philosophies, the often unaddressed needs and common oversights of your target audience(s)</li><li> Checklists that get you&rsquo;re your target audience really thinking about how they are being served, and how they want to be served in the future</li><li> Books that further develop your story and your define your value, either your own or books from complimentary authors</li><li> An assessment that scores or measures someone&rsquo;s mindset or circumstances and provides instant feedback as to their &ldquo;effectiveness&rdquo; (i.e. custom risk tolerance or life balance assessment)</li><li> Infographics that quickly, concisely and visually express important concepts or facts</li><li> Regular and timely blog posts that share your diverse and specific insight</li><li> Packaged solutions that address and/or resonate with your target audience (the best way to attract specific niche is to provide niche specific ideas, content and resources)</li><li> &ldquo;Packaging&rdquo; could include a name, icon or description of said &ldquo;idea&rdquo; but what really important here is that you&rsquo;ve brought this &ldquo;idea&rdquo; to life and it in itself tells your brand story</li><li> &ldquo;Client experience&rdquo; initiatives within your office and in your community; this may include: <li>  Warm and inviting reception area </li> <li>  Documented meeting summaries and uniquely written financial plans </li> <li>  A less formal first meeting, or a more structured meeting process </li> <li>  An introduction video to your firm in the reception area </li> <li>  Community initiatives that include clients </li> <li>  Client events that promote your brand and build trust </li> <li>  Well-organized teams that have clear roles and make it easy for clients to know who to go to for answers to questions </li></li><p> If you&rsquo;ve had the patience to read through this article &ndash; you have my thanks.</p><p> If you walk away with one piece of learning, I hope it is that effectively advisor marketing ideas are more than just having the right logo, tag line, website and brochure. Effective advisor marketing requires building trust and the way to do that is to share your wisdom &ndash; freely, regularly and in a variety of ways. I hope these marketing ideas help you in your quest to grow your practice.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-11 15:53:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-11 15:53:44.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_Mutd7Df.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/financial-advisor-marketing-ideas-that-build-brand-depth/\", \"post_id\": \"12389\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-11 15:53:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-11 15:53:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"financial-advisor-marketing-ideas-that-build-brand-depth\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12388\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6017\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Financial-Advisor-Marketing-Ideas-That-Build-Brand-Depth.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1228\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468350000,"author_id":284,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5779,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Improvisation: What We Can Learn Form the Brilliance of Second City","link":"improvisation-what-we-can-learn-form-the-brilliance-of-second-city","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Yes, I&rsquo;m biased. I&rsquo;m a former theatre guy.</p><p> I think of this as I stumble on an article about improvisation in, of all places, the Wall Street Journal (7/8/2016). From a young age on we&rsquo;re taught to master impulse control. It&rsquo;s what grown-ups do, right? We manage our emotions. Avoid distraction. Aim for a zen-like focus, a sense of control.</p><p> Enter improvisation. The art of conscious impulse surrender. At Second City in Chicago, the improv comedy troupe that has launched the careers of celebrities like Jim Belushi and Tina Fey, scientists and engineers and nurses and psychologists now practice the art of impulse surrender.  It&rsquo;s been a total change from left-brain attorney to right-brain class-taker , says Second City student and retired attorney Irv Levinson. In a recent episode of &ldquo;The Simpsons,&rdquo; Homer recovers from giving a disastrous speech by taking an improv class. Yes, improvisation has left the theatre vault.</p><p> There is a place for impulse control, of course. It behooves me to know my blind spots. Left unchecked, I can swing toward sarcasm. I am a better person when I stay mindful of this impulse and let it pass.</p><p> But here are just a few of the brilliant gifts of conscious impulse surrender. They are subtle and sweet, and they elevate any business conversation we have.</p><h3> <strong>  Celebrate the wealth of words. </strong></h3><p> <br/> We habitually consume language as if were fast food. Taste-less, quickly discarded, instantly forgotten. We babble without paying attention to linguistic nuance. Improv reminds us that at our best, we are consciously creating a conversation, moment by moment, word choice by word choice. It begins by truly hearing the words that come our way. By explicitly picking up on those cues in our response. When done well we actually call it word play. Nice, right?</p><h3> <strong>  Seize the energy of the moment. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Every moment has pace, velocity, stasis or momentum. Improv sharpens our ability to tune into the energy of a person, a group of people, a moment. We sense it, and we consciously merge with that energy, subvert it or expand it. We begin to revel in the unspoken dynamics of a conversation and playfully mold them. So liberating, right?</p><h3> <strong>  Embrace the gift of the detour. </strong></h3><p> <br/> In our linearly prejudiced world, we are programmed to avoid tangents like the plague. Detours are considered sacrilegious. Improv gives us shameless permission to investigate any cue, linear or not. It knows that a detour is often more illuminating and insightful then the predetermined path. It implores us to not simply give the answer we think they want but to follow the thought that wishes to be expressed. Way cool, right?</p><h3> <strong>  Excavate meaning. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Great improvisers don&rsquo;t simply spout funny stuff and or do silly things. They seize an impulse and create meaning in split-seconds. They have trained their meaning-antennas. They note implicit meaning, seize it, blow it up, shape it into a story. A key leadership skill for any corporate leader is the ability to articulate meaning. It&rsquo;s easy to offer pre-packaged meaning. But how much more resonant it is when we notice the meaning that actually emerges in a moment! Stirring, right?</p><p> Wanna transcend transactional competence in your daily endeavors?

We cover the DOL Fiduciary Rule in more detail  <a href=\"http://blog.advisorassist.com/2016/05/analyzing-department-of-labor-fiduciary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  in a previous post </a> , but we thought we'd share.</p><h3> 1. In RIA with Rollover, since AUM increases, but fees decrease or services increase then are you a conflict? Trusted advisor is increasing income, but client getting something for it.</h3>A: This question seems to be asking when an Advisor is managing a client&rsquo;s retirement plan assets and recommends a rollover to another vehicle, such as an IRA, since the Advisor&rsquo;s assets under management (AUM) will increase but overall fees paid by the client will decrease, or services received by the client increase, then are you in a conflict? The Advisor&rsquo;s compensation is increasing but the client getting something for it.The recommendation of a rollover creates a potential for a conflict of interest. Therefore, the Advisor making the recommendation should document with the client why the rollover is in the client&rsquo;s best interest. The fact that overall fees paid by the client will decrease, or services received by the client will increase with the rollover are good reason why the rollover is in the client&rsquo;s best interest and therefore, should documented in the client&rsquo;s profile and if it is not already in the client agreement, the client should receive notice that the Advisor is a fiduciary acting in the client&rsquo;s best interest.The definition goes on to explain what constitutes a &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; and what may be excluded from that definition, such as providing certain services or information regarding the plan or IRA, such as marketing or making available to a plan fiduciary a platform or similar mechanism where the plan fiduciary may select or monitor investment alternatives; identifying investment alternatives that meet objective criteria specified by the plan fiduciary; providing objective financial data and comparisons with independent benchmarks to the plan fiduciary.<h3> 2. If an Advisor recommends that a client rollover from a 401(k), hence increasing the Advisor&rsquo;s AUM and the client&rsquo;s fees (regardless of investment), does not that create a conflict of interest?</h3>A: Correct, the recommendation of a rollover creates a potential for a conflict of interest. Therefore the Advisor making the recommendation should document why the rollover is in the client&rsquo;s best interest.##TRENDING##<h3> 3. How do you get the expenses of the 401(k) that the employee was paying?</h3>A: Clients should be able to produce documentation regarding the expenses that they are currently paying for their 401(k) plan. The Advisor will want to collect the current fee structure of their client&rsquo;s 401(k) plan as a factor in making an informed recommendation about why any rollover from that plan is in the client&rsquo;s best interest.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> 4. How do we get the expenses of the 401(k) to the client?</h3>A: If you are trying to obtain information about a client&rsquo;s 401(k) you should contact the plan sponsor. However, this question seems to be asking how do Advisors ensure they are not responsible for the expenses of a client&rsquo;s 401(k).Unless an Advisor is engaging clients in a &ldquo;wrap fee&rdquo; program, where the client pays a single advisory fee for the management and services of their account including custodian and brokerage fees, then the clients should be responsible for paying expenses related to the management of their account. Advisors should ensure that their client agreements and Form ADV Part 2A, Item 5(C) fully and accurately disclose which party is responsible for fees related to the account management.Although an RIA may not be compensated by a commission or revenue sharing, Form ADV requires disclosure to clients regarding potential conflicts and compensation arrangements. Hybrid advisors receiving commission compensation will want to ensure they are satisfying the BICE. Therefore as a best practice we recommend that even firms without commission or revenue sharing fees should provide notice to retirement clients that they are providing their services in the client's best interest to uphold their fiduciary duty and review and update disclosures of any potential conflict of interest. This will ensure that you are availing your firm of the BICE and creating a presumption of compliance with the Rule.<h3> 5. If I'm an RIA and already a fiduciary, and serve ERISA qualified plans as a 3(21) advisor and 3(38) manager capacity, and already have level fees fully disclosed and transparent within Advisory Agreements. (408b2 compliant), how am I really impacted by the DOL Rule? The only thing I've read is needing to document rollovers if I will get compensated for the rollover into an IRA (versus keeping funds in a 401k Plan, for instance) - which I already do to some degree.</h3>A: Correct. The ongoing receipt of a Level Fee such as a fixed percentage of the value of a customer&rsquo;s assets under management, where such values are determined by readily available independent sources or independent valuations, typically would not raise prohibited transaction concerns for the Advisor.Under these circumstances, the compensation amount depends solely on the value of the investments in a client account, and ordinarily the interests of the Advisor in making prudent investment recommendations, which could have an effect on compensation received, are aligned with the Retirement Investor&rsquo;s interests in increasing and protecting account investments. However, there is a conflict of interest when an Advisor recommends that a participant roll money out of a plan into a fee-based account that will generate ongoing fees for the Advisor that he would not otherwise receive, even if the fees going-forward do not vary with the assets recommended or invested.As stated in question 1, for a level fee fiduciary to recommend a rollover the Advisor should document information supporting the recommendation in the client&rsquo;s profile. Additionally, if it is not already in the client agreement, the client should receive notice that the Advisor is a fiduciary acting in the client&rsquo;s best interest. It is our view that this written notice can also be communicated to the client via Form ADV.<h3> 6. Are there any best practices yet regarding the type of disclosure of the compensation arrangement and conflicts of interest (slide 13) - which I already disclose in our Firm's ADV?</h3>A: The best practices regarding disclosure of compensation arrangement and conflicts of interest will evolve as we get closer to the full implementation date of this rule, January 1, 2018. That being said, if you are not a level fee Advisor and seeking to make use of the Best Interest Contract Exemption you will want compensation arrangements and conflicts of interest disclosed in a separate Best Interest Contract or as an addition to existing agreements along with the other requirements of the Best Interest Contract Exemption.Also in the preamble to the final rule, the Department of Labor recommended the creation of web disclosure, which they state should contain: A schedule of typical account or contract fees and service charges, and a list of product manufacturers with whom arrangements have been made to provide payments to the Advisor, including whether the arrangements impact Advisor compensation. The DOL also suggests disclosure of the business model and the Material Conflicts of Interest, including payout grids and non-cash compensation and rewards.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> 7. Not sure if you covered this.... what about my existing clients that generate trails?</h3>A: At this time we do not believe that trail compensation from commission transactions based on prior recommendations would be relevant to the DOL Rule change. If it is in the client&rsquo;s best interest to transition those assets to another vehicle, or if a new recommendatio that would involve a commission trail should arise, those would be relevant to your compliance for your fiduciary duty and the DOL fiduciary rule, respectively.<h3> 8a. [Is there a] Conflict if [a] Fee Only RIA is NOT advisor to the qualified plan but solicits retiree to rollover to IRA? (the value added is RIA gives advise (sic) whereas existing qualified plan does not give that advice.</h3>A: The recommendation of a rollover of retirement plan assets creates a potential for a conflict of interest. Therefore, the Advisor making the recommendation should document why the rollover is in the client&rsquo;s best interest. Advisors should also be aware if any of their solicitors are making such recommendations and ensure they have documentation to support the recommendation. The statement that the IRA has more options available to it for investment, and therefore more opportunity for different strategies by means of advisory services from the RIA, can be given by the Advisor that the rollover may be in the client&rsquo;s best interest given the full profile of the client.<h3> 8b. Does DOL recognize that distinction?</h3>A: Yes. The DOL Fiduciary Rule would consider you to be a Level Fee Advisor.<h3> 8c. Am I giving client that disclosure or just adding to my ADV and client file?</h3>A: Form ADV should be completely and accurately disclosing fees charged by the Advisor in Item 5, and any other compensation received in Item 14. Advisors are typically required to deliver Form ADV to all new clients, and existing clients annually or upon a material change. The DOL Fiduciary Rule would require full disclosure of all fees related to a client&rsquo;s retirement plan assets when certain recommendations are made, such as a rollover.<h3> 9. Are [these] rules [applying] to discount brokers or robo advisors?</h3>A: The DOL Fiduciary Rule applies to anyone making the recommendations to clients in qualified plans for a fee. ERISA contains an exemption to prohibited transactions in section 408(b)(14) that covers robo-advisors and is available for robo-advice involving prohibited transactions if its conditions are satisfied. However, robo-advisors that are Level Fee Fiduciaries may rely on the Best Interest Contract Exemption with respect to investment advice to engage the robo-advice provider for advisory or investment management services for Plan or IRA assets, provided they comply with the conditions applicable to Level Fee Fiduciaries, as discussed in question 1 above.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> 10a. Doesn't the rule impose a significant burden on the fee only RIA to know the fees charged in the 401(k)? Sometimes is it very hard to find this out fully. Clients don't always provide this information and it is not always correct.</h3>A: The new rule sets forth a requirement for certain information when making a recommendation to Retirement Investors. It requires that the Advisor, when providing investment advice to the Retirement Investor, that at the time of the recommendation, such advice reflects the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, based on the investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial circumstances, and needs of the Retirement Investor. Therefore, we would recommend performing all the necessary due diligence, whether with the client or directly with the plan sponsor of the client&rsquo;s 401(k) in order to substantiate the recommendation(s) made, including current fee structure on 401(k) plans affected by the advice.<h3> 10b. Since we have no access to the 401(k), how do you confirm the information?</h3>A: As stated in question 10a above, due diligence requirements should include gathering information from all sources available including contacting the sponsor of the plan, if needed.<h3> 11a. What do you mean by \"level fee\" advisor?</h3>A: Level fee advisors are those that meet the definition of a level fee fiduciary by receiving the same compensation regardless of the particular investments the client makes, whether based on a fixed percentage of assets under management or a fixed dollar fee.The full definition of a Level Fee Fiduciary is located in Section VIII(h) of the <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/04/08/2016-07925/best-interest-contract-exemption\" target=\"_blank\"> Best Interest Contract Exemption Final Rule</a><h3> 11b. Are you talking about an AUM %? or something else?</h3>A: An Advisor whose compensation is based on the client&rsquo;s assets under management would be an example of a Level Fee Fiduciary for the purposes of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.<h3> 12. Does the ADV Part II provide adequate disclosure for fee only RIAs?</h3>A: It is our view that this written disclosure can also be communicated to the client via Form ADV.<h3> 13. Would an RIA be considered a level fee fiduciary if they charge differently for equities/bonds/cash?</h3>A: Based on the definition of Level Fee Fiduciary above that does not sound like it would meet the requirements for the purposes of the DOL Fiduciary Rule since the Advisor would receive different compensation depending on what investments were made.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-11 16:41:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-11 16:41:17.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_rnBE4nO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/17-questions-answered-about-the-dol-fiduciary-rule-change/\", \"post_id\": \"12396\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-11 16:41:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-11 16:41:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"17-questions-answered-about-the-dol-fiduciary-rule-change\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12395\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6020\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/17-Questions-Answered-About-the-DOL-Fiduciary-Rule-Change.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1041\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468339800,"author_id":115,"chart_url":""}

An agenda embraces someone&rsquo;s goals, but it&rsquo;s even broader.</h3><p> <br/> To highlight how important this is, let me introduce you to Richard Major. Richard taught me a lesson I&rsquo;ll never forget about understanding agendas.</p><p> Richard is a senior executive at his company, where he&rsquo;s worked for 25 years. He manages the very largest client accounts. The whales. He is not just good at what he does; he is one of the best I&rsquo;ve ever met. His stats prove this &ndash; he ranks number one in his firm for revenue production. And has for years.</p><p> If you met Richard, at first blush you may think he lacks some of the finer relationship skills. He doesn&rsquo;t relish small talk, for example. He&rsquo;s exceptionally bright, but you might not think he&rsquo;s the most smooth talker&mdash;sometimes he interjects &ldquo;you know&rdquo; or &ldquo;uh&rdquo; in his sentences. But don&rsquo;t be put off by that. He has an unrivalled instinct when it comes to building relationships with his clients, and a keen eye for spotting opportunities for them.</p><p> While I was consulting with his company on a revenue growth initiative, Richard taught me an essential, career-changing lesson.</p><p> We were sitting in a big conference room, and what Richard referred to as a &ldquo;corporate honcho,&rdquo; at the head of the table, was interrogating everyone about how much more growth they could squeeze out of their client relationships. He asked each executive the same questions:</p><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your stretch revenue goal for this client?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What additional services can you sell?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s keeping you from accomplishing your goal?&rdquo;</p><p> When Honcho asked Richard, however, he met an immovable object. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your revenue goal for the TCR Corporation next year?&rdquo; Honcho asked him.</p><p> Richard&rsquo;s terse response to the first question was, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have one. It will depend on what the client needs.&rdquo; His reply to the second question was similar: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. We follow the client&rsquo;s agenda.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about serving their agenda of critical priorities, needs, and goals.&rdquo;</p><p> During the coffee break, Richard pulled me aside. &ldquo;I meant what I said. TCR wasn&rsquo;t even a client ten years ago. And now it&rsquo;s the second largest account in the firm&mdash;over $30 million a year in revenue.&rdquo;</p><p> The next day, Richard and I had lunch at a local sandwich shop. It was just the two of us. No corporate Honcho&mdash;he was back at the head office interrogating more people about their revenue targets!</p><p> I asked Richard a simple question: &ldquo;Why are you so successful with clients?&rdquo; I wanted to know his secret.</p><p> Richard was usually pretty serious, but now he looked at me, exhaled, and smiled. &ldquo;Let me show you something.&rdquo; He set down his Diet Coke, and reached for something in his pocket. It was a small, folded sheet of paper. It was wrinkled and creased. It had obviously been opened and re-folded many times. Richard slowly unfolded it.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> I couldn&rsquo;t quite see it from across the table, but it looked like a list of names with some scrawls next to each name. Some words had been crossed out, and new ones written in next to the crossed out sections. Different pens had obviously been used at different times.</p><p> &ldquo;You see this piece of paper?&rdquo; Richard asked me. He held the sheet out towards me. &ldquo;This is a list of the names of my top clients. Next to each name I have listed that executive&rsquo;s agenda&mdash;his or her most important priorities.&rdquo; He paused. I felt as though every other diner in the restaurant had stopped eating and turned to look at us, waiting to hear Bill&rsquo;s secret.</p><h3> &ldquo;My job in life&hellip;is to  help each one of them to accomplish their agenda . Period. That&rsquo;s my singular focus.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Richard&rsquo;s mission was not to deliver interesting consulting projects&mdash;it was to help his clients achieve their most important goals.</p><p> Your relationship-building journey must start with the other person&rsquo;s agenda. Not yours. Theirs. Whether you&rsquo;re talking about a client, a colleague, your boss, or a friend, your first job is to understand that person&rsquo;s agenda. Do you know what is important to them&mdash;really important&mdash;right now? Only when you know this will you clearly see how you can help them and add value to the relationship.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-11 16:49:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-11 16:49:00.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_hyHfXqx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-essential-starting-point-for-any-relationship/\", \"post_id\": \"12398\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-11 16:49:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-11 16:49:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-essential-starting-point-for-any-relationship\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12397\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6021\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Essential-Starting-Point-for-Any-Relationship.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"464\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468314000,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

The more projects we start and the more marketing we throw out there &ndash; often the less productive it all becomes. Is it better to focus time and energy to get one project working to generate leads and new business or to have 10 projects splitting focus which all seem disappointing?</p><p> And with multitasking in general, the thought is that because we are so busy we almost have to do more than one thing at a time to accomplish the growing list of activities that pull on our limited time. The facts prove out, however, that although we feel we are getting more done, we are actually causing ourselves more work. Here are a few studies that may surprise you about how multitasking actually has inverse effects on productivity (and even makes you less intelligent!)</p><p> When we multitask, (i.e. try to perform two or more related tasks at the same time or by alternating rapidly between them) errors go way up. That is according to a study done by David Meyer, the Director of the Brain, Cognition and Action Laboratory at the University of Michigan. The result is, according to this study, that it takes far longer to get the jobs done than if the tasks were done sequentially.</p><h3> A Harvard Business Review post says that multitasking leads to as much as a 40% drop in productivity, increased stress, and a 10% drop in IQ (Bergman, 2010). Now that&rsquo;s scary!</h3><p> <br/> A 2009 study at Stanford, reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, looked at 100 students who multitask during the day with all their technology, the internet, school work, classes, etc.</p><p> What they found was that the more the students multitasked, the worse they performed.</p><p> The human attention span is 8 seconds today and that means that no one is paying attention to anyone or anything for very long. Let&rsquo;s bring focus back and I bet we will also see results increase &ndash; especially in our marketing.

{"original_id":5786,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"As Boomers Retire, Who Has the Greater Appetite for Leading?","link":"as-boomers-retire-who-has-the-greater-appetite-for-leading","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We are wading deeper into a period of large leadership shifts. The Baby Boomer generation, still the largest group in charge, increasingly will be handing over their leadership roles through retirement or, while sticking around, through voluntary or involuntary role shifts to step aside for new blood.</p><p> The early consensus had been that Gen Xers, by age and tenure the next in line to take over, was not really very interested. They were at first, as a generation, labeled &ldquo;slackers&rdquo; in the &lsquo;80s. In truth, they have turned out to be hard workers, seriously committed at work and often overly involved parents. But owing to the relatively small size of that generation and a lesser tendency to self-express and self-promote than the Gen Y/Millennials and Boomers, they are neglected as leadership material and consumers. That may be a mistake.</p><p> After reading the  <a href=\"https://workplacetrends.com/the-millennial-leadership-survey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  press release </a>  about a recent survey, a journalist from MainStreet.com put out this query: &ldquo;Explain why Millennials are more willing for the leadership roles and why that trait never matured in Gen Xers.&rdquo;  Here are the survey findings followed by my response to the query.</p><p> The study of 412 Millennials in the U.S. (ages of the group studied were not given in the press release on the study so I am uncertain precisely how the generation was defined),  The Millennial Leadership Survey by  Virtuali  and  <a href=\"https://workplacetrends.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Workplace Trends </a> , indicated the following:</p><li> 91% of Millennials, including 52% of the women responding, aspire to be leaders.</li><li> Almost half of respondents define leadership as &ldquo;empowering others to succeed.&rdquo;</li><li> 43% said &ldquo;empowering others&rdquo; was their greatest motivator to lead.</li><li> 5% said they were most motivated to lead by money.</li><li> 63% want to be &ldquo;transformational leaders.&rdquo;</li><li> 28% said their biggest hesitancy about being a leader was difficulty achieving work-life balance.</li><li> 51% said communication was one of their strongest skills, and 58% think that is the most important leadership skill.</li><li> 66% said ability to build relationships was one of their strongest skills, and 55% said that was the most important leadership skill. <br/>  </li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> (Adding 58% + 55% totals 113%. In any case, those were the top two choices.) Those are self-perceptions of their skills. It is possible they think technology skills make them fine communicators and relationship builders.</p><li> The leadership skills they say they are weakest in are industry experience and technical expertise.</li><li> The type of training they think would be most effective for their development as leaders are online classes (68%) and mentoring (53%). This sounds like individualized training.</li><li> 55% are not satisfied with the leadership development opportunities their employer offers.</li><li> 39% of respondents said their company&rsquo;s leaders are weak in their development of others; 50% said the biggest problem with their leaders is communication.</li><li> 83% would prefer to have fewer layers of management where they work.</li><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  My Response </strong></h3><p> <br/> First, I question the query&rsquo;s implication that Millennials are, and Gen Xers aren&rsquo;t, eager for or willing to take on leadership roles is accurate as a broad brush statement, especially throwing both older and younger Gen Xers into the group discussed. The two halves of the cohort are different from each other, just as older and younger Baby Boomers differ. Whether or not they have that desire to lead &ldquo;trait,&rdquo; many Gen Xers are becoming leaders, many of them strong leaders, and some other surveys have indicated many Millennials don&rsquo;t aspire to leadership.</p><p> As to why the Millennials have developed the &ldquo;eager for leadership trait,&rdquo; it derives from their formative influences, including more widespread adult expectations and support than former generations had. For example:</p><li> They were encouraged by Boomer parents to be leaders and were mentored and coached from a young age.</li><li> Parents, mentors, teachers and coaches built up their confidence and self-esteem and praised them to &ldquo;go for it,&rdquo; especially if they were passionate about something.</li><li> Those with a high quality education (not necessarily an elite one) were encouraged to speak up, initiate and lead in school.</li><li> And they were taught the importance of, and encouraged to, network and develop relationships. (Sometimes &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; was the more accurate description than &ldquo;encouraged.&rdquo;)  But Millennials in general may be overestimating their leadership communication skills other than technological savvy. <br/>  </li><p> The older half of the Gen Xers&rsquo; formative years were quite different. (The youngest Gen Xers are more similar to older Millennials.) Faced with a few recessions, their bumpy road was not eased by doting parents, teachers, coaches and mentors. They have felt they survived and developed on their own, so they are not as motivated to give back by &ldquo;empowering others&rdquo; as leaders.</p><p> Who do you think is more willing to lead? Who is most prepared to lead? Who will ultimately be the better leaders?

I'm particularly astute to watch for marketers who use bullish tactics to sell their marketing points - especially when they come at the price of a financial service professional's business.</p><li> \"If you don't do 'x', then you suck at marketing your practice.\" </li><li> \"If you don't hire 'x' then your website lacks any relevance.\"</li><li> \"Do this or just agree that your business will fail.\"</li><p> I imagined myself sitting on the other side of the article, reading this as a professional and wondered if the article helped or just would piss me off?

Do not listen to the social media gurus, ninjas, experts, or whatever different superhero name they come up. Listen to the advice which makes the most sense for you and your company. Follow the lead of those you respect and want to work with.  <br/> <br/> In the end, we never want any bully to win no matter what area of life we are talking about. Bullies be damned!

{"original_id":5788,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Big Trends in Innovation and Change Happening in Fintech","link":"6-big-trends-in-innovation-and-change-happening-in-fintech","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When someone sends me something interesting, I can&rsquo;t help but share it so this insight from Susan Visser came at just the right moment. Susan and I have exchanged various ideas over the years, so here&rsquo;s her view of the key Fintech trends.</p><h3> Summary <br/>  </h3><p> Data is having a tremendous impact on customer experience, and through enhanced insight is boosting customer profitability in the financial sector. Take a brief glimpse at six trends in which fintech innovation is steering imaginative and profound approaches to rich customer experiences for financial consumers.</p><p> The biggest trend in fintech today is centered around improving customer experiences. Some say that millennials are driving this push, but perhaps the cause is much subtle. Millennials are known to be tech-savvy and often reject apps or products that do not integrate easily into their lifestyle. But, as digital and mobile technologies become part of daily life, everyone is demanding that the interfaces we interact with fit into the way we want to do things&mdash;seamlessly and effortlessly.</p><h3> A deep dive into innovation <br/>  </h3><p> It is important to take into account the customer experience changes that are occurring around us that perhaps can be summarized as Uberization. Essentially, Uber and others like it&mdash;Airbnb and Alibaba, for example&mdash;are interfaces to common chores in our lives: calling for a taxi, booking a vacation or making a retail purchase. Now, we&rsquo;re finally seeing these human-like, yet technology-based, interfaces showing up in financial services like banking, wealth management and insurance. Let&rsquo;s explore 6 examples of innovation and change happening now in fintech.</p><h3> 1. Chat applications <br/>  </h3><p> Applications that accommodate chats are now being integrated into the banking world. Earlier this year, Facebook launched its Messenger Platform to &ldquo;build deeper interactions with its customers on Messenger in a way that is contextual, convenient and delightful, with control at its core.&rdquo; TD Bank was the first bank to integrate Messenger with customer service.</p><p> Learn more about chat applications for banking in a recent Finance in Focus Podcast featuring Jeffry Chan, manager of marketing innovations at TD Bank Group and Chris Skinner, CEO, The Finanser, Ltd., and chairman, The Financial Service Club.</p><h3> 2. Biometric authentication <br/>  </h3><p> Data security is a prime concern, especially when we consider access to our money. Security and easy access are at opposite sides of the table in this discussion, so you can be sure that debates around biometric authentication are very active. But a great deal of risk currently surrounds retinal and fingerprint scans, as implied by the title of the recent Phys.org article &ldquo;Retinal Scans and Fingerprint Checks: High Tech or High Risk?&rdquo; by Chris Marr.</p><p> And in the article, &ldquo;Biometrics Continues Its Move into Financial Services,&rdquo; Paul Schaus writes: &ldquo;About 50 financial institutions around the world are beginning to implement biometric authentication at their contact centers.&rdquo; As finance companies test the technology, security is expected to improve and more of these organizations will adopt this technology.</p><h3> 3. Voice recognition <br/>  </h3><p> Before the emergence of the smartphone there was the cell phone. We might have used it for some texting, but we primarily used our now old-fashioned cell phones as, well, a phone, with the core purpose being to simply to speak to another person. With smartphones, not only can we talk to another person, but we&rsquo;re also increasingly able to use the device to interact with apps by issuing commands, searching the Internet or dictating a message to be sent as text.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> In March 2016, Capital One became the first financial institution to enable clients to access their finances using just their voice. Those who activate this service can speak into Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa-enabled devices, including Echo, to get their account balances and pay bills. Expect to see much greater activity in this area. As we learn from Mark Ryan in the article &ldquo;Will Voice Recognition Kill Online Banking?&rdquo;: &ldquo;All of the big players in web and software are pouring large investments into voice-driven tools.&rdquo; Ryan cites Google Now, the Amazon Alexa Channel, Microsoft Cortana, Facebook&rsquo;s M and the Nuance Dragon Speech Recognition software as making significant improvements in voice recognition tools during the last five years.</p><h3> 4. Internet of Things <br/>  </h3><p> Every industry and business is exploring the exciting topic of the Internet of Things (IoT). From IBM&rsquo;s perspective, as the Internet of Things becomes ubiquitous and the cost of embedding connectivity and intelligence becomes increasingly more cost-effective, companies are now focusing on how to successfully compete in the Internet of Things.</p><p> The most obvious example of this technology in finance is in wearable devices such as smartwatches. Fitbit, which has 13 million active users of its fitness-tracking device, is poised to take advantage of this technology with its recent purchase of the start-up Coin. Right now, these devices are being used as a way to pay for purchases, but the potential is much larger when location services are included. Getting notifications is pretty easy when your bank account is in danger of overdraft, but alerts for sales based on your location is the next logical evolution. More advanced uses of the Internet of Things include having your refrigerator order and pay for groceries when supplies get low or your car paying for gas just by connecting to a pump.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 5. Blockchain <br/>  </h3><p> Blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger, is a foundation for transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability and transparency while streamlining business processes. One of the use cases Chris Skinner points out in his Brave New Coin article, &ldquo;The Five Major Use Cases for Financial Blockchains,&rdquo; is that blockchain digitizes contracts. And in doing so, it can eliminate legal paperwork &ldquo;because you can record something on a shared ledger and, once recorded, it is irrefutable, digital proof that this thing happened at that time on this date between these counterparties.&rdquo; Imagine buying a car, a house or a condo and needing only an electronic record of the transaction.</p><h3> 6. Artificial intelligence and cognitive computing <br/>  </h3><p> Computers that understand reason and learn by themselves constitutes one of the biggest trends we&rsquo;re seeing this year. IBM Watson might be the best known implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) at this point. Watson understands natural language that humans use, and it is able to improve its algorithms by continually ingesting massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Of course, the idea isn&rsquo;t to eliminate humans; rather it is to help us make decisions faster, more accurately and more efficiently than ever.</p><p> Another example in this area is the recent addition of robots to banking branches in Japan. In the article &ldquo;Robots and AI Invade Banking&rdquo; appearing on The Financial Brand website, Jim Marous introduces us to Mizuho Bank&rsquo;s use of a robot named Pepper.

An effective compliance program starts from the top with consistent firm wide communication and the firm's key principals setting the proper example by making it clear that firm takes its compliance responsibilities seriously.</p><p> This culture needs to be reinforced on a daily basis, but the firm's annual compliance meeting with all staff members is also a ripe opportunity to set expectations and more formally establish the proper compliance culture. The annual compliance meeting provides the opportunity for the CCO to conduct necessary training for supervised staff, communicate updates to the firm&rsquo;s written policies and procedures, answer questions, and to review relevant regulatory changes.</p><p> When a regulatory examiner first arrives to perform an audit, one of the first goals of the examiner is try and gauge how seriously a firm takes its regulatory responsibilities. First impressions make a big difference  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/your-ria-firm-is-going-to-be-audited-its-just-a-matter-of-when\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  during an audit </a>  and there are many steps to take when developing a culture of compliance at an RIA firm such as:</p><li> Develop and implement a supervisory policies and procedures manual and a code of ethics that is communicated and understood by all staff members.</li><li> Provide initial and ongoing training for all staff members including having a portion of the new employee onboarding process dedicated to compliance.</li><li> Have staff members attest to having reviewed the firm&rsquo;s unique policies and procedures, code of ethics, and any other appropriate documents.</li><li> Establish employee communication procedures such as how to communicate when there are relevant regulatory changes, there is a pending regulatory exam, or  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  deficiencies are found during an exam </a> .</li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The examples listed above are far from an exhaustive list of steps a firm needs to take. However, as  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/when-and-when-not-to-work-with-an-ria-compliance-consultant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  RIA compliance consultants </a> , we also want to stress the importance of establishing a true culture of compliance rather than simply going through the motions. Investment advisory firm principals need to be focused on compliance not just because of various regulatory requirements, but rather since it allows the firm to better serve clients by creating checks and balances through proper systemization. </p><p> It's also important to note that while hiring a qualified CCO or personally spending more time on compliance may be a good first step in addressing the firm's regulatory responsibilities, that act alone is not enough. As recently discussed by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff during their  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/sec-outlines-ria-examination-protocol-during-compliance-seminar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  national compliance outreach seminar </a> , proper compliance is not only the CCO's responsibility, but rather the proper compliance culture must be adopted across the entire firm.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-12 14:59:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-12 14:59:53.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_DEXxIgV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-advisors-can-create-a-culture-of-compliance/\", \"post_id\": \"12412\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-12 14:59:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-12 14:59:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-advisors-can-create-a-culture-of-compliance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12411\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6029\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/How-Advisors-Can-Create-a-Culture-of-Compliance.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"480\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468422000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Maybe it was watching my mother who, to this day, never acknowledges when she is sad, mad or needs any sort of help. Nonetheless, as I look back at my career, I know that there were many times where I suffered unnecessarily and certainly longer than I should have. And while getting through and crossing that imaginary finish line may present a gift of relief coupled with a dose of success, it&rsquo;s a short-lived celebration&hellip;because the race simply starts right back up again.</p><p> So why do we turn everyday life challenges into a never-ending endurance race? Typically, the catalyst is our own unwillingness or inability to give ourselves permission to change.</p><p> There are countless examples of times I forced myself to endure a situation needlessly, yet a couple stand out&hellip;</p><p> Like the years I worked as a &ldquo;one-armed paperhanger,&rdquo; acting as CEO, COO, and C everything else to my business, without so much as pausing to acknowledge that I was spending the majority of my time doing things I hated nor was good at (like administrative, bookkeeping and human resource work) and not nearly enough time doing what I loved (building client relationships). It wasn&rsquo;t until my husband encouraged me one day to put an ad in the local paper to hire an assistant that it even occurred to me that I was  entitled  to help.</p><p> Or how about the times where I simply didn&rsquo;t feel well and couldn&rsquo;t give myself the permission to take the day off because I believed my employees, my clients, and the world wouldn&rsquo;t function without me?</p><p> And of course, there are way too many times that I agreed to talk with a client well past normal business hours, simply because I worried that saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; would mean people would think less of me.</p><h3> How I ended some of my own personal endurances races <br/>  </h3><p> In hindsight, the solutions to my overwork and overwhelm were so simple, yet, when in the moment, I just couldn&rsquo;t see my way out. I kept telling myself,  &ldquo;You took this on, now you need to finish it.&rdquo;</p><p> For instance, to solve for my overwhelm at work, I hired the very best assistant/office manager 10 years ago (and since then, countless other indispensable employees) who, as if in one fell swoop, freed me of the minutia that was weighing me down. I have since taken many days off because I was under the weather or just needed some time to power down, and I set a virtually unbreakable rule whereby I do not take business calls after 7pm (and, to my knowledge, not one person has thought me lame).</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> All of these relatively simple acts turned out to be revolutionary for me, positively impacting my need for quiet and replenishment, and to find balance between the professional and personal sides of my life. They certainly relieved some of the burden of running that seemingly unstoppable endurance race of daily life!</p><p> For most of us, the ability to find an answer to a problem is relatively easy; it&rsquo;s realizing that there is a problem in the first place and then giving ourselves the permission to change that&rsquo;s the hard part. And that  &ldquo;permission to change&rdquo;  is key here, because we are entitled to feel supported and balanced&mdash; and there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p><p> Life, as it turns out, is not meant to be lived as a test of endurance. A life well-lived is one that is paced with the terrain. While it won&rsquo;t all be smooth, allowing yourself to stop and chart a new course every now and then is completely acceptable and even highly recommended.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-12 15:06:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-12 15:06:48.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_z262eeX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-running-a-never-ending-endurance-race-in-business-and-life/\", \"post_id\": \"12414\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-12 15:06:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-12 15:06:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-running-a-never-ending-endurance-race-in-business-and-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12413\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6030\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Are-You-Running-a-Never-Ending-Endurance-Race-in-Business-and-Life.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"999\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468436400,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5791,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Does a College Education Makes Financial Sense","link":"does-a-college-education-makes-financial-sense","source_link":null,"content":"<p> How do you know when the cost of a college education is really worth it? A lot of factors&mdash;both financial and emotional&mdash;go into making that decision. Weighing the pros and cons can be daunting.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s consider a couple of examples that will help conceptualize the process of determining if a college education makes financial sense.</h3><p> <br/> First, here are some numbers for traditional students. The cost of an average four-year education at Yale is around $240,000, and the average starting salary for its graduates is $55,000. The monthly payment on a student loan for that amount would be $2,420, or $29,159 a year. That equals 53% of the starting salary. There are a lot of other variables to consider, like potential scholarships that would lower the tuition, or lowering the loan payment by stretching out the amortization period (which actually increases the overall cost). But given these facts the answer to whether this education makes financial sense is a no-brainer. No; find another school.</p><p> At the South Dakota School of Mines, by contrast, the cost of an average four-year education is around $65,000 and the average starting salary is $68,000. The monthly payment on a student loan for that amount would be $648, or $7,897 a year. That equals 12% of the starting salary. The cost of this education makes complete sense.</p><p> For traditional students, my personal rule of thumb is this: don&rsquo;t pay more than one and a half times the average starting salary of a job for the education to obtain it.</p><p> For non-traditional students who are looking to switch careers, the calculation is a little more involved. You must weigh the salary you earn in your current career with the cost and net increase in the career you are considering.</p><p> Recently a reader emailed me this question: \"I have a bachelor's degree in my chosen career and am unable to find a full-time, benefitted, permanent job. When is it no longer a good financial decision to not go back to college? I can pick up a degree in a different field for $8,000. If I am 12-13 years from retirement, is it worth it?\"</p><p> The average salary for a job in her career field is $20 an hour, or $42,000 a year. The problem is that she has not been able to find employment in her career field. She has only been able to find temporary jobs with earnings of $9.77 to $12.75 per hour.</p><p> So far her four-year degree has netted her around $12,500 a year. Her research shows that if she went back to school for two years she could switch to a career field more in demand in her area and earn $45,000 a year. That&rsquo;s $32,500 more per year. If she invests two years and $8,000 in education, then works in her new career for 10 years, she can earn an additional $325,000 before retirement.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If she were to borrow the funds needed for her education and repay the loan at 4% for 10 years, her monthly payment would be $81, or $972 a year. That equals about 2% of her salary. Given these facts, going back to school makes clear financial sense.</p><p> Of course, financial factors are not the only ones to consider in deciding whether to invest in education. Looking at the numbers is essential, but it's equally important to find a career field that suits your talents and interests. It makes no sense to spend time and money preparing for a career you don't want. The most rewarding college investment is one that provides worthwhile returns in emotional satisfaction as well as financial success.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-12 15:28:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-12 15:28:06.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_daTDkQx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/does-a-college-education-makes-financial-sense/\", \"post_id\": \"12416\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-12 15:28:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-12 15:28:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"does-a-college-education-makes-financial-sense\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12415\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6031\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Does-a-College-Education-Makes-Financial-Sense.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1510\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468404000,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

In my eyes and, I believe many others, most hardware stores sell the same stuff. They might have a few different brands, but overall, it&rsquo;s the same products to help you around the house and garden. Being a very competitive market has meant they have had to work hard to differentiate themselves, and I believe a couple of them have done a great job of that. Bunnings and Home Hardware. What&rsquo;s so good about their marketing I hear you ask?</p><p> It&rsquo;s what they say about themselves!</p><p> Bunnings &ndash; Lowest prices are just the beginning.</p><p> Home Hardware &ndash; Go where the tradies go.</p><p> Both articulate their value differently. One focuses on prices, the other on expertise.</p><p> Can you see how easily they have achieved this? Both businesses deliver a similar product, but both have very different marketing approaches.</p><p> Why am I talking hardware stores? Because, similar to hardware stores, the majority of advice businesses do offer the same solutions. One of the challenges some financial advice businesses struggle with is differentiating themselves from all the others.</p><p> In the past, I&rsquo;ve talked about using client stories to help articulate your difference; using a current scenario to explain the value you can add to clients.</p><p> Another very useful method that you can start working on in your business right now is how you describe your business.</p><p> For example, consider these two examples below:</p><h3> The question is, &ldquo;What does your business do?&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><h3> Business one <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;We develop financial solutions for the needs of our clients.

We&rsquo;ve been around for 20 years and enjoy working with our clients to help develop their plan and manage their financial implementation.&rdquo;</p><h3> Business two <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;We work with clients who are thinking about retirement. We help them with issues such as, will they have enough money to retire on when they want to retire, how to actually transition to retirement, how will they work with Centrelink, selling assets if required, overall, helping them with their total retirement planning.&rdquo;</p><p> Can you see, how business one talks about the general and business two speaks of the specifics? Business one might be able to help pre-retires, and I suspect probably could. However, they didn&rsquo;t say that. In fact, they didn&rsquo;t say much at all.</p><p> There are three goals you want to achieve when articulating your value:</p><p> 1. To be remembered. <br/> 2. To be understood. <br/> 3. To be introduced/referred.</p><p> Business number two can achieve that. They will be remembered for working with pre-retires who are looking for advice about moving into retirement.</p><p> Business number one has a formidable chance of being forgotten because they are too general and haven&rsquo;t given anyone anything to grasp on to and remember easily.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> I appreciate that many Financial Advisers feel that if they target a particular demographic or niche area that they may not get enough clients. I can tell you from experience and education; that is not the case. The more specific you are, in today&rsquo;s world, the better your business will be.</p><p> A single way to differentiate and stand out, is to work on the words that come out when people ask, &ldquo;What does your business do/what do you do?&rsquo;</p><p> Remember the three goals. How does your business explanation achieve these aims?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-12 16:10:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-12 16:10:05.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_FGInZRR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-business-goals-you-must-achieve-when-marketing-your-value/\", \"post_id\": \"12418\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-12 16:10:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-12 16:10:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-business-goals-you-must-achieve-when-marketing-your-value\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12417\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6032\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/3-Business-Goals-You-MUST-Achieve-When-Marketing-Your-Value.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"507\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468418400,"author_id":392,"chart_url":""}

Have you ever met someone who was totally different than you thought they&rsquo;d be?  Maybe you&rsquo;d known them in a past-life, like back in high school, many, many moons ago. Maybe you&rsquo;d known them in a different context, like you had worked together and now you&rsquo;re seeing them socially for the first time.  Maybe you just followed them on social media and had never really met for real. But somehow, before you really got to know this person, you had a picture in your mind of who you thought they were and what they were like and when you actually spend time with them, the two realities don&rsquo;t jive. Ever happen to you before?</p><p> It happened to me recently and it was very&hellip; disturbing. It made me question my own instincts about people as the person-I-got-to-know and the person-I thought-that-was were so drastically different that it was a very jarring experience.  And that got me thinking about how others might experience me.  Do they ever think of me one way or assume that I&rsquo;m a certain way and then find themselves totally shocked when they meet the real-in-the-flesh-Kimberly?  Am I the person they thought I&rsquo;d be?</p><h3> We make assumptions about people. We decide about them.

But Pelham&hellip; you&rsquo;re one of those kind of people.&rdquo; I was a little confused, to be honest.  What did he think Pelham was like? What did he assume I was like?

I can control how congruent I am with my actions that lead others to decide about me. Because if people are going to make assumptions about me, I want to give them as much evidence to go on as I can, to help them to see what is real.  I don&rsquo;t want to profess one thing and show up as someone totally different.  I don&rsquo;t want to teach one thing and do the opposite.  I don&rsquo;t want to expect something from others that I&rsquo;m not willing to do myself. I want to bring mindfulness that my actions are in alignment with my words, with the quotes and quips and blogs that I put out in social media, and with the choices I make.</p><p> Knowing full well that assumptions will be made.</p><p> Mindfulness begins with us.

{"original_id":5794,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Yield is Gone – How Advisors can Avoid a “Clexit\"","link":"the-yield-is-gone-how-advisors-can-avoid-a-clexit","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Remember the phrase &ldquo;lower for longer&rdquo; that the market used to use to describe the outlook for US interest rates? In a post-Brexit world, &ldquo;lower forever&rdquo; seems more appropriate. The continued, and possible permanent, low interest rate environment worldwide holds significant consequences for investors. And also for investment advisors who want to avoid a &ldquo;Clexit,&rdquo; that is, a client exit.</p><h3> Interest Rate Policies and Low Interest Rates</h3>How did we get here? The answer that many people will give to this question is monetary policy &ndash; meaning that central banks around the world, through their interest rate policies, are responsible for low interest rates. While this is accurate on the surface, the reasons central banks need to lower interest rates in the first place reveal the true answers:<li> <strong>  The Great Recession. </strong> The great recession is the single largest contributor to continued low interest rates, although by no means the only factor. The collapse in credit associated with the great recession destroyed all kinds of growth: asset prices (think real estate), economic output (think company earnings) and, of course, employment. These outcomes are all very deflationary, and the monetary policy response to deflation is to lower interest rates to stimulate credit and economic growth. Central banks around the world &ndash; including the United States &ndash; are still fighting deflationary forces unleashed by the great recession.</li><li> <strong>  Demographics. </strong> One need only look at Japan to see the economic and growth consequences of an aging population. In comparison with its 10 percent real GDP growth rate between 1950 and 1960 and a 4 percent growth rate between 1970 and 1980, Japan has only managed an average growth rate of 1 percent since the early 1990s. This declining trend has been driven by Japan&rsquo;s considerable demographic challenges. Population aging is a significant demographic issue for Japan and a common feature among developed economies &ndash; the United States included. Deflationary to be sure.</li><li> <strong>  Globalization and the Democratization of Uncertainty. </strong> Uncertainty breeds conservatism and conservatism is, you guessed it, deflationary. Because of the interconnectedness of a globalized world, we have new and seemingly never ending sources of uncertainty. Brexit is one example of a global uncertainty generator, and there are many others. The problem is compounded by the fact that financial markets and people have not yet developed the models and mental frameworks to deal with an increased uncertainty output from around the world.</li><h3> Implications for Investors</h3>Investors of all types, and their investment advisors, need to sharpen their yield hunting skills. This doesn&rsquo;t mean piling into the highest yielding bond fund or preferred stock, but rather it requires understanding the fundamentals of yield. What role does yield play versus growth in a portfolio? What is an appropriate expectation? Where can yield be found?Yield and return expectations are especially important since they set the goal posts. Expectations that are too low can result in missing opportunities and failing to reach future portfolio goals. Expectations that are too high &ndash; which I believe is the typical expectation error &ndash; can lead to stretching for yield (and taking too much risk relative to your risk tolerance) and creating a false sense of security regarding the probability that your portfolio will grow to its targeted number.It&rsquo;s very easy to increase the expected return assumption in a retirement planner and think that everything is on track. I&rsquo;ve done this myself and it&rsquo;s magical when you see your portfolio value in 2040 after just a point or two increase in expected return. Realistic, maybe not, but magical for sure.##TRENDING##<h3> Opportunities for Advisors &ndash; and How to Avoid a Clexit</h3>Financial advisors have an important role, and opportunity, in helping clients cope with a low yield environment. &ldquo;Lower forever&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean your clients will have to work forever, but it does challenge the typical asset allocation models.As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I believe appropriate expectations are key to the equation, including the happiness and retention of your clients. I&rsquo;ve had advisors tell me, in an effort to get my business, that they could easily beat the return goals that I&rsquo;d set for my own portfolio. Understanding the fundamentals of yield allowed me to evaluate these claims in a rational and consistent way. It will also help your clients do the same, should this situation arise for them, which it probably will.Finding the appropriate yield instruments is surely an area where advisors can add value. This requires the advisor to explore and become knowledgeable about where to find yield. Fortunately, there are several investments vehicles where yield can be found.These broadly fall under the category of alternative investments and include Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Business Development Companies (BDCs), and life insurance based investments, which are gaining popularity due to their potential to create yield that is not correlated to traditional financial markets. Every advisor needs to understand alternative investments and how they can add yield to investment portfolios.

They're enthusiastic. Ask for information. Want to talk to you on the phone. Ask for a proposal. Tell you they're \"genuinely interested\" in what you're offering. And \"need something concrete to discuss in a meeting that's coming up.\"</p><p> And then...nothing. <br/> <br/> The sale doesn't move forward. No decision is made. No further action from your side required. And \"they'll be back in touch when they know more.\" <br/> <br/> Here's the thing: sometimes the people we start talking to are not the people we should be talking to. Sellers I speak with often talk about the need to develop their networking skills to \"go around someone and get to the real decision maker.\" <br/> <br/> Most struggle, believing that they will damage the existing relationship if they go over someone's head to try to establish a relationship higher up in the organization. <br/> <br/> Indeed, this is the wrong approach to take. <br/> <br/> It's not about getting around people. It's about taking people along on the journey. It&rsquo;s about using your networking skills to move up the ladder and get introductions. <br/> <br/> Specifically, there are 3 keys to getting past what I call \"mock buyers.\" They look like buyers. They sound like buyers. They may even act like buyers. But they're not (really) buyers at all. It&rsquo;s up to you to find out who the real buyer is, and include them in the conversation.</p><h3> Here are three ways you can do that without damaging relationships along the way: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Build the Relationship First <br/>  </h3><p> In order for you to get someone to introduce you to their manager, colleague or a member of their management team, you'll have to build the relationship first. You have to deliver value, and do so for long enough for them to: <br/> <br/> All of these things take time. <br/> <br/> But if you consistently deliver value, and do so in a way that positions you as a valued advisor instead of a salesperson, you'll get to the time where you can have an open and honest conversation and say something like, \"I can't help but notice we've had several conversations and things don't seem to be moving forward as much as we expected. Is there anything we can do together to move this forward?\"</p><li> Start trusting you</li><li> Start liking you</li><li> Believe you have their best interest in mind <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Provide an Incentive for Action <br/>  </h3><p> Even if you've built the relationship to the point where they trust you (and trust you will do the right thing), you still have to give them a reason to act. Helping you make the sale is about their agenda, not yours. <br/> <br/> So make it about them: their rational and emotional needs, their agenda, and their personal afflictions and aspirations.</p><p> ##TRENDING## <br/> <br/> Provide a clear, compelling reason for them to take action and decide the best next step together. A great way to do this is by asking questions like: <br/> <br/> Build on the answers to these questions, keep asking \"why,\" and dig deeper until you get to the point where they tell you what the impact on them (personally) of acting (or not acting) will be. That's when you've found their individual reason to take action.</p><li> Out of all the options we have available, what do you think our next move should be?</li><li> Is there anyone in the organization we haven't talked to yet who should be involved?</li><li> What would happen if we kept pursuing the same path we're on now? What wouldn't happen?</li><li> If you're on board, what else needs to happen to get going?</li><li> What do you think is required to move this forward?</li><h3> 3. Position Yourself as an Ally <br/>  </h3><p> You've built trust and the relationship. You've discovered their reason to take action.

What do you see? <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;m envisioning a true partnership, built on mutual respect and maintained with frequent, open communication. Each spouse would be fully aware of and equally able to manage all aspects of the marital finances. Neither would feel anxious, uninformed, or left out. In this marriage, money would not be a source of anger, mistrust, or resentment. Husband and wife would function as a team with common goals, including a financially healthy retirement.</p><p> Sound good? Well, as you might guess (or know from personal experience), most marriages fall a bit short of this vision.</p><p> Fidelity Investments conducts an online biennial Couples Retirement Study which examines how couples deal with family finances, particularly where retirement is concerned. For example, the 2015 study analyzed the retirement and financial expectations and preparedness of 1,051 committed couples (at least 25 years old, and with a minimum annual household income of $75,000 or at least $100,000 in investible assets). Results show that in many couples, there are significant differences in what each partner knows and expects about their retirement financing.</p><p> This infographic lays it out: Although 72% of couples surveyed reported communicating exceptionally or very well about financial matters, 60% of the respondents disagreed on what their Social Security payments would be in retirement, and more than 40% couldn&rsquo;t even correctly identify how much their partner earns&mdash;that&rsquo;s a major disconnect!</p><p> And there&rsquo;s more: Almost half of the couples surveyed had no idea how much they would need to save to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement. More than half (51%) reported worrying about outliving their savings. That&rsquo;s up from 42% in 2013. Even so, 36% say they haven&rsquo;t even thought about developing a retirement plan. (In 2013, that figure was 28%.)</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> In short, the study found that American couples are worrying more, and planning less, than just two years ago.</p><p> Of course, investment companies are eager to make it easier for people to identify and understand how much they&rsquo;ll need to retire comfortably, and to devise strategies to ensure there&rsquo;s the money available to do it. Having commissioned the study, it&rsquo;s likely that Fidelity has identified a role for itself in improving this situation.</p><p> Divorce financial advisors can help, too. As someone who works exclusively with women, I&rsquo;ve noticed that in many marriages where there has been some retirement planning, savings, and investment, it&rsquo;s typically the husband who&rsquo;s done it&mdash;and the wife who is, for whatever reason, uninvolved and essentially in the dark. It&rsquo;s a major concern to me that wives participate so little in the major financial decision-making of their marriages. In the event of a divorce, lack of financial literacy has very serious implications for a woman&rsquo;s financial future.</p><p> Achieving a secure retirement should be a primary financial goal for all adults. Ideally, married couples work as a team to plan for their retirement, invest, and save according to strategies they discuss openly with each other and their financial and tax advisors, and then check in on a regular basis to make adjustments as needed. In the real world, though, things often don&rsquo;t work quite that well. If you&rsquo;re happily married, I advise you to work toward improving your knowledge of and communication about finances. If you&rsquo;re divorcing, getting up to speed is a matter of absolute urgency as a means to the best settlement possible.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-12 17:01:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-12 17:01:54.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_lxNoQb6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-common-and-troubling-problem-for-divorcing-women-nearing-retirement/\", \"post_id\": \"12426\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-12 17:01:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-12 17:01:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-common-and-troubling-problem-for-divorcing-women-nearing-retirement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12425\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6036\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A-Common-and-Troubling-Problem-for-Divorcing-Women-Nearing-Retirement.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"454\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468404000,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5797,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How the Future of Impact Investing Will Affect Investors","link":"how-the-future-of-impact-investing-will-affect-investors","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> In his keynote address at a 2013 G8 Conference , British Prime Minister David Cameron voiced his support for impact investing, believing that European governments should do more to support socially-responsible investments. <br/>  </h3><p> The World Economic Forum has predicted the impact investment market will grow to $500 billion by 2020. Other analysts place the figure closer to $1 trillion. Despite all the enthusiasm surrounding impact investing, some financial advisors remain uninformed. According to a CFA Institute report, 66% of advisors admitted to being unfamiliar with the practice. The continued growth of impact investing will depend on educating financial advisors and investors.</p><p> A major reason for this expected growth is the impending transfer of wealth from parents to their children. Millennials and Generation Xers stand to inherit between $30 and $40 trillion dollars from the baby boomer generation. The magnitude of this wealth transfer is unmatched by previous generations. Beyond simply the size of the inheritance, Millennials have different priorities than the generations before them. Younger investors seek investments that yield a social return, as well as a financial one.</p><p> When asked about the primary purpose of business, 36% of Millennials selected &ldquo;Improve Society&rdquo; as their answer. Other answers included &ldquo;Enable Progress,&rdquo; which was chosen by 25% of participants, and &ldquo;Create Wealth,&rdquo; which was picked only 15% of the time (Deloitte Survey, 2014).</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Access-to-Premium-Prices.png\" width=\"660\"/></p><p> In the past, investments in emerging or non-traditional markets were viewed as exceedingly risky. A lack of transparency and available information discouraged investors from exploring opportunities abroad. The digital age has changed that. Enhanced connectivity now makes it possible for investors to act wisely when investing in emerging markets. Moreover, the credit ratings in many developing nations&mdash;such as Mexico and Brazil&mdash;have improved as governments exercise greater fiscal responsibility. This development creates more opportunity for impact investing.</p><p> Investing for gender equality is rapidly becoming one of the most popular forms of impact investing. The goal is to promote gender parity and personal empowerment through debt and equity investments. There are three basic types of gender equality investments: supporting female-owned enterprises, funding companies that offer products and services for women, or expanding employment opportunities for women.</p><p> Organizations like the Calvert Foundation and Root Capital have launched initiatives to promote gender-focused investments. To quote Jackie VanderBrug, a former managing director of Criterion Ventures and now SVP at U.S. Trust: &ldquo;Women are key assets in combating poverty, building their communities, and creating new pathways to a more just and sustainable world. Investing in women&rsquo;s education, economic welfare, health, and overall well-being produces powerful results that benefit families, communities, and entire societies. When women become economic agents and leaders, social change accelerates and returns multiply.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Foreign investment in developing countries dropped 16% in 2014. This has resulted in a $2.5 trillion funding gap, which has made it nearly impossible for these countries to cope with lingering problems like food and water shortages, limited healthcare access, and failing infrastructure.</p><p> Similarly, the clean energy sector is experiencing a major shortfall. The International Energy Agency calculates that an additional $36 trillion will be needed over the next 35 years to curb the most extreme effects of climate change. Since philanthropic activity alone cannot bridge the gap, advisors must educate themselves and their clients on impact investing. Our globalized economy has made it possible to engender social change and produce a healthy return on investment. Whether we can find solutions to the most pressing global challenges will depend on the commitment and foresight of investors.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-12 17:13:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-12 17:13:22.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_InzXmg8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-the-future-of-impact-investing-will-affect-investors/\", \"post_id\": \"12429\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-12 17:13:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-12 17:13:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-the-future-of-impact-investing-will-affect-investors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12427\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6037\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/How-the-Future-of-Impact-Investing-Will-Affect-Investors.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"977\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468400400,"author_id":320,"chart_url":""}

As you know, value drivers are critical because they can create business transferable value&mdash;the Holy Grail of Exit Planning.Transferable value is what a business is worth, to someone else, without its original owner.Owners aren&rsquo;t always aware that transferable value is more than a formula involving multiples of earnings or some projection of discounted future cash flows. To point them in the direction of transferable value, Exit Planners ask, &ldquo;If you permanently leave your business today, would it continue with minimal disruption to its cash flow?&rdquo; An obvious follow-up question is, &ldquo;Who will be responsible for running the business without you&mdash;and with minimal disruption to cash flow?&rdquo; The answer you are looking for is, &ldquo;My company&rsquo;s management. They&rsquo;ve already proven their ability to grow the company.&rdquo;While a company&rsquo;s management team is also instrumental in growing cash flow or business value, the discussion we have with owners relates to growing cash flow beyond the capabilities of the owner. We call those managers &ldquo;next-level,&rdquo; Peter Drucker calls them &ldquo;entrepreneurial management&rdquo; but either way, they are indeed, the mother of all value drivers.Drucker, says this about entrepreneurial management, &ldquo;It requires . . . building a top management team long before the new venture actually needs one and long before it can actually afford one.&rdquo;</p><h3> Spotting Next-Level Managers</h3>Next-level managers are often those who have worked in companies that are larger, often much larger, than your client&rsquo;s. They know how to grow companies at least to the level of the larger companies they&rsquo;ve worked for.  Finding next-level managers involves attracting people with the experience and skill sets necessary for the company your client wants and needs it to be.That, I believe, is part of Drucker&rsquo;s message to entrepreneurs: growing a business significantly requires management that knows how and what to do&mdash;indeed has done it before for a larger company. This level of management will demand more money, perhaps ownership as a condition of employment.<h3> Breaking It Down For Owners</h3>Skilled Exit Planners assign three tasks to owners who appreciate the value in developing and retaining next-level management.Task 1. Attracting and retaining next-level management can involve training and coaching existing management to the level needed, adding next-level management, and replacing or transferring underperforming management.Making the decision to replace existing management is not easy for owners. Still, most usually have a gut feeling when doing so is the right decision. When that intuition butts up against loyalty, friendship and the obligation they feel toward long-time managers, you can help them to stay the course.When owners consider whether to replace part or all of their management teams, you can help them to understand that doing so is normal for rapidly growing companies. Next-level management, in large part, causes that growth. Eventually, the first set of next-level managers may also be replaced.##TRENDING##You can reassure owners that hiring next-level management does not mean casting out management employees with six weeks of severance pay. Members of current management may still be very valuable&mdash;just in different roles. Often they can remain employed and perform well and responsibly, but in a sphere more appropriate to their experience level.Task 2. If appropriate, engage management consultants and outside resources to spur growth. Exit Planning advisors maintain robust networks of other professionals so they can recommend the appropriate consultants to assess, train and coach existing management.BEI member Ken A. Stiefler, CExP&trade; did exactly that in working with one of his Exit Planning clients. &ldquo;This owner brought me in when he recognized two things about himself: 1) too much of the business revolved around him, and 2) he wasn&rsquo;t capable of taking the business to the next level. In an effort to change his role, the owner began planning to replace himself by: 1) bringing in a new general manager (instead of simply delegating to existing management), 2) creating a plan to delegate his responsibilities, over time, to others in the company and 3) looking at outsourcing some tasks.&rdquo;Task 3. Only owners can provide leadership and motivate top management to achieve the goals owners have set in their exit or growth plans. You should work with owners to design plans that provide strong incentives to management to remain with the company beyond the owner&rsquo;s departure.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> Motivate For Today and Tomorrow</h3>Motivating employees to perform at a higher level benefits owners today and tomorrow.Current Benefit:  When owners provide top managers financial incentives designed to grow cash flow or business value the company is more likely to achieve the value or cash flow necessary to support the owner&rsquo;s exit goals.Future Benefit: Well-designed incentive plans also motivate management to remain after the owner exits. To thrive, management usually must stay in the business when owners leave. If they do not, transferable value suffers and the owner is not likely going to achieve his or her financial or values-based goals.Exit Planners commonly use a &ldquo;non-qualified deferred compensation plan,&rdquo; or NQDC Plan that involves both a benefit formula and vesting schedule to motivate and retain key employees.The benefit formula typically relies on a performance benchmark that motivates participating key employees to increase the profitability or cash flow goals of a company. Employees usually receive cash awards&mdash;typically about half of it paid in cash each year if cash flow or profitability reaches or exceeds the pre-determined benchmark. The remaining half of the award is deferred and subject to vesting. Unless the business or key employee reaches the benchmark, employees receive no benefit.Vesting schedules in NQDCs are similar to those used in many qualified retirement plans such as 401(k) or defined benefit plans. Like many qualified plans, a key employee is vested in the benefit over a number of years. If that employee leaves before becoming fully vested, they forfeit part or all of the accrued benefit.The appeal of incentive plans for key employees (management) is understandable: To create transferable value, someone other than the owner must be similarly motivated to grow value and the cash flow necessary to achieve the owner&rsquo;s exit goals and continue the company beyond the owner&rsquo;s exit. That &ldquo;someone&rdquo; must be, can only be, the management team.If all fails, invoke the Father of Modern Management, Peter Drucker: Unless owners &ldquo;build a top level management team before [their companies] reaches the point where it must have one,&rdquo; a company will not be the great, durable enterprise it must be to enable owners to exit it when they want, for the money they need, in the hands of the successor they choose.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-12 17:27:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-12 17:27:09.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_Y68cdTW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-role-of-next-level-management-in-building-transferable-value/\", \"post_id\": \"12433\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-12 17:27:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-12 17:27:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-role-of-next-level-management-in-building-transferable-value\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12432\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6039\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/the-role-next-level-management-building-transferable-value.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"888\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468396800,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

In a Deep Financial Hole? \"Toughing It out\" May Not Be the Answer","link":"credit-card-maxed-out-in-a-deep-financial-hole-toughing-it-out-may-not-be-the-answer","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> In my many years as an advisor, I&rsquo;ve found that the hardest part of my job isn&rsquo;t managing the numbers or dealing with the ups and downs of the market. <br/>  </h3><p> What&rsquo;s far more difficult for me is seeing a client get completely overwhelmed and embarrassed by money problems. Self-judgment. Guilt. Self-criticism. They can all rear their ugly heads. And perhaps the worst part of all is knowing that some folks are too embarrassed to share their money problems&mdash;even with their trusted advisor.</p><p> Last month, I had what seemed like an easy phone call with Jane. Her husband Gary is hoping to retire in the next few years, and she wanted to review their finances to see where they stood. The couple moved to Arizona two years ago after Jane received an early retirement package. With her husband&rsquo;s $65K annual salary, her pension, and other investment income, their income is $90K a year. They owe $150K on their home, including a $110K mortgage and a $40K HELOC at 5.5% and 6% respectively. After running some ballpark numbers, I told Jane it looked like Gary could retire in about three years when he turned 65. According to my calculations, with Medicare reducing their health insurance costs and their combined pensions and IRA-401(k) withdrawals, they should be able to live quite comfortably.</p><p> The next day I received this email from Jane.</p><p> I was too embarrassed to tell you this yesterday, George, but our finances aren&rsquo;t quite as simple as it seems. In fact, I expect Gary&rsquo;s retirement will have to wait indefinitely as we&rsquo;ve gotten ourselves into some pretty hot water financially. Our income simply isn&rsquo;t enough to cover anything but our basic expenses, so we&rsquo;ve used credit cards to cover ourselves. I&rsquo;m mortified to tell you that we&rsquo;ve racked up more than $30,000 in high-interest debt that is costing us more than $700 a month in payments. With that on top of our mortgage and home equity loan payments, etc., you can see why retirement is out of the question, at least for quite some time. We&rsquo;re in a terrible mess. It&rsquo;s so bad that we can&rsquo;t even afford the $14,000 needed to repair our air conditioning&mdash;a tough situation in the Arizona heat. It hit 113 degrees here yesterday, but without the funds, I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll just have to &ldquo;tough it out.&rdquo;</p><p> Though I doubt you can help at this point, I would appreciate your input. I'd prefer to communicate via email. I couldn't listen to your kind voice, all I would hear is disappointment and pity. Just sending this email has me in tears.</p><p> It was heartbreaking to read her note. Clearly, Jane was terribly embarrassed about her situation&mdash;reacting as if she&rsquo;d done something wrong or had gotten herself into this bad situation. While I was able to see the numbers as a financial puzzle to be solved, Jane viewed the situation as an insurmountable personal failure. The good news: I already had some very realistic solutions forming in my head. Of course, I had two distinct advantages that Jane didn&rsquo;t. First, as an advisor, I&rsquo;m experienced to see the forest&mdash;not just the trees. Second (and perhaps most importantly), since it&rsquo;s not my own money we&rsquo;re looking at, my perspective isn&rsquo;t clouded by emotion and self-judgment, so I can be objective.</p><p> I immediately reached out to Jane (via email, of course!) to let her know that what she was facing was actually a small problem that she only perceived to be unsolvable. In fact, she had assets available that could be quickly and easily leveraged to address her needs. She called that afternoon, and together we kicked into gear. Here&rsquo;s a high-level view of how we&rsquo;ll turn down the heat:</p><p> On my recommendation, Jane immediately withdrew an additional $2,500 from the existing HELOC at the local bank. We added that amount to another $2,500 on her credit card to make the required $5K deposit on the much-needed AC repair to get it ordered. We then withdrew $14,3000 from her ROTH to cover the remaining cost of the air conditioner to get them out of the heat&mdash;literally&mdash;within the week. Whew!</p><p> We placed the remaining funds from the ROTH withdrawal into Jane and Gary&rsquo;s checking account as an emergency fund to keep them from resorting to credit cards for future car repairs, home repairs, and other unbudgeted expenses.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> To reduce their mortgage payments, we&rsquo;re refinancing both the primary mortgage (5.5%) and the HELOC (6%) to an amortized 30-year fixed rate at 3.75%. This will reduce their payment from $1200 to less than $800 a month.</p><p> The next item on the agenda is to tackle their high-interest credit card debt, using a one-time withdrawal from Jane&rsquo;s $800K IRA to pay it off. With the increase in expendable monthly income, they should be able to pay off the remaining of $11K in credit card debt by early 2017. If they&rsquo;re short, we&rsquo;ll make another withdrawal from the IRA next year. And they&rsquo;ll keep $5,000 to $7,000 in the bank for emergencies so they don&rsquo;t keep dipping into the credit card &ldquo;well&rdquo; to cover surprise expenses.</p><p> No matter how wise or successful you may be in other areas of your life, financial planning can feel like a dark, murky, mysterious world&mdash;and it can throw things out of perspective. To get through a trying financial situation, rest assured that no matter what your challenges, &ldquo;toughing it out&rdquo; may not be the only answer. Talk to a trusted financial advisor, get the guidance you need, and take control of your finances. It&rsquo;s the best way to get out of the heat and stop sweating.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-13 14:53:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-13 14:53:21.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_tu4FumN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/credit-card-maxed-out-in-a-deep-financial-hole-toughing-it-out-may-not-be-the-answer/\", \"post_id\": \"12435\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-13 14:53:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-13 14:53:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"credit-card-maxed-out-in-a-deep-financial-hole-toughing-it-out-may-not-be-the-answer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12434\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6040\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/credit-card-maxed-out-deep-financial-hole-toughing-it-out-may-not-be-answer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"939\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468497600,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5801,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Investing in ETFs: How They Fit Into an Investment Strategy","link":"investing-in-etfs-how-they-fit-into-an-investment-strategy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> NBC recently published a story on the growing popularity of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. According to the article, 81% of advisors surveyed said they used or recommended ETFs to their clients in 2015. We have been advocating ETFs as a secure, flexible investment for our clients since the days when they weren&rsquo;t as popular.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a look at some ETF basics.</p><h3> What Are ETFs? <br/>  </h3><p> An ETF combines features of stocks and mutual funds. Like a mutual fund, it is composed of a group of stocks, giving investors access to a diverse array of securities with only one transaction, an investment in the fund. And like stocks, an ETF can be bought or sold on the open market at market-determined prices. ETFs are usually used to track specific indexes of the securities market as a whole or of specific sectors. The first ETF in 1993 was created to track and match the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><h3> Why Do We Use Them? <br/>  </h3><p> ETFs have a number of advantages for investors who are saving for retirement. These include:</p><li> <strong>  Transparency:  </strong> While the holdings of a regular mutual fund are only reported every quarter or year, ETFs report their holdings every day since they are traded and the holdings are a reflection of an index. Knowing exactly which positions you are invested in can help with fine-tuning your portfolio according to your risk tolerance.</li><li> <strong>  Lower costs:  </strong> The passive nature of ETFs allows them to have significantly lower costs than a mutual fund. In short, actively managed funds, as the name implies, execute a far greater number of trades than passive funds like ETFs, which are generally not overseen by a fund manager on a daily basis. As a result, ETFs usually incur much lower costs than actively managed funds. </li><li> <strong>  Flexibility: </strong>  Mutual funds, whether active or passive, can only be sold at the end of the trading day. On the other hand, ETFs are traded throughout the day and their price continually updated.</li><li> <strong>  Tax efficiency:  </strong> There are several factors underlying the structure and operations of ETFs that make them more efficient than a lot of mutual funds. To buy shares of a mutual fund, you must exchange cash for shares directly with the fund. There is no middleman; therefore, when the fund realizes capital gains on an investment, those gains are passed through to the individual investors and you must pay tax on it. When purchasing shares of an ETF, the shares in the ETF are purchased through a middleman called an Authorized Participant, not the fund itself. (The AP purchases shares from the fund when they are originally issued.) This degree of removal from the fund and the capital gains it realizes can help you avoid significant taxes on long-term capital gains. Additionally, since ETFs don&rsquo;t make as many trades as actively-managed funds, there are fewer chances for an event that could generate capital gains, which will be taxed.</li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> So how do they fit with our investment strategy?</h3><p> We think that your best chance at building wealth through the markets for retirement is to work with a fiduciary advisor to utilize a long-term approach that emphasizes diversification, tax efficiency, risk management and cost effectiveness. We believe in the efficient market hypothesis, which dictates that in the long run, it is nearly impossible to beat the returns of the market by picking individual stocks and market timing. Therefore, an ETF is generally a stable&mdash;but flexible&mdash;tool for long-term growth if used properly.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-13 15:04:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-13 15:04:40.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_DTTJDbS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/investing-in-etfs-how-they-fit-into-an-investment-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"12437\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-13 15:04:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-13 15:04:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"investing-in-etfs-how-they-fit-into-an-investment-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12436\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6041\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/investing-etfs-how-they-fit-investment-strategy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"576\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468512000,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

What is the best way to inspire them to actually bring someone that is appropriate for my business? - Looking for qualified referrals <br/>  </h3><p> Dear Looking for Qualified Referrals,</p><p> First let me congratulate you on having a clear objective for your events; knowing what you want to accomplish allows you to zero in on the best strategy and get better results.</p><p> As for referrals you are in luck. Recently on one of my membership calls an advisor shared her approach to getting qualified referrals to her event that was simple but brilliant.</p><p> When Bernice called to invite her clients to her women&rsquo;s event she was very specific and clear who she wanted them to invite. Instead of just saying &ldquo;bring a friend&rdquo; she helped them think WHO they should bring. She said &ldquo;I would love it if you would bring a friend that has recently lost a job, is retiring or recently lost a spouse&rdquo;. Not only did her clients bring friends, but Bernice walked away with a few great leads and qualified appointments.</p><p> You could even take it a step further and use the invite call as a way to build even deeper connections.  You could start the call announcing a new event for women, then explain why this is important to you and share your story &ldquo;why you care about women.&rdquo; You can then move onto your mission i.e.; My mission is to help every woman who has lost a spouse&hellip;&hellip;.&rdquo;  And then zero in on who comes to mind for them at that moment.</p><p> Here is a sample script:</p><p> The purpose for my call is to invite you to a new event I am launching next month in order to reach more women in our community.</p><p> You see I don&rsquo;t know If you know this about me but&hellip;.(your story here).</p><p> It&rsquo;s for this reason that I have decided to focus my efforts this year on making sure every woman becomes financially confident so I wanted to invite you and a friend of yours to my event on (date) for lunch at (location).</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> My event is specifically designed for women who have recently experienced a life changing event, for some it may be retirement, for others divorce or becoming a widow.  It seems every woman knows some woman going through a challenging time. These are the type of women who would gain the most value. Off the top of your head does anyone come to mind?</p><p> Well I would love it if you would be one of my guests and if you could bring a friend that you know that has recently gone through a transitional event that would be even better.</p><p> So the more you ask for what you want, and the more specific you are with what you need the easier it is for the clients to help out.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-13 15:24:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-13 15:24:28.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_rQxwLsu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-simple-but-brilliant-approach-to-generate-more-qualified-leads/\", \"post_id\": \"12439\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-13 15:24:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-13 15:24:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-simple-but-brilliant-approach-to-generate-more-qualified-leads\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12438\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6042\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/simple-brilliant-approach-generate-more-qualified-leads.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"511\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468504800,"author_id":5,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5803,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Your Organizational Structure and Human Capital Practices Helping You Grow?","link":"is-your-organizational-structure-and-human-capital-practices-helping-you-grow","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The growth of your firm relies on your strategic plan, your organizational structure and your human capital practices. <br/>  </h3><p> Build your business strategy first, to get a clear understanding of what you want to deliver to clients. But then clarify your organizational structure to make sure you have the right people doing the right things.</p><p> A client-centric business like an advisory firm requires you to define your service offering. To make informed decisions about whom to hire, and in which roles, you need to ask yourself several questions: Who are your target clients? What are their advice and service needs? What does the desired client experience look like?</p><p> What skills will your team need? How should your team work together to deliver the desired experience? Are there any working styles that will better suit your target market and foster the desired culture and experience you want in your firm?</p><p> Another question to ask: What levels of revenue and profit do you expect in your first year (and your third and fifth)? Once you determine your own financial plan, you can plan how many new clients you need to introduce to the business every year &mdash; and calculate the revenue required from existing relationships to sustain your cost structure.</p><h3> DIFFERENT MODELS <br/>  </h3><p> With those questions answered, take a hard look at your firm&rsquo;s organization. There are three basic types of advisory firm business models that can affect the way you deliver service to clients.</p><p> The solo model is essentially an individual practice. It revolves around one professional plus some support staff. These practices benefit from the owner&rsquo;s high touch; the reputation of the firm is tied to the principal.</p><p> Solo firms offer advisors control, flexibility and the potential to earn a high income, making the model a preferred choice for many advisors throughout the life cycle of their practice and career.</p><p> Additionally, since most advisors I have met did not get into the advisory business to manage people, the simple organizational structure (with minimal management responsibilities) is very appealing.</p><p> Yet this model is limiting as well: All of the burden is on the solo advisor to find new clients, build the business and provide high-quality service to retain existing clients. In most cases, that limitation reduces the future valuation of the firm.</p><p> The silo model, on the other hand, is essentially a combination of solo practices. Silo firms have multiple advisors who maintain their own books of clients &mdash; so clients belong to the individual advisor, not the firm &mdash; but share such overhead expenses as office space, technology and support staff. Compensation stems largely from an advisor&rsquo;s own client base. There is little or no sharing of profits and there is limited opportunity for joint initiatives or strategy.</p><p> This model has a lot of downsides: Such practices are hard to scale, operate inefficiently and provide no real opportunity for a career track for staff members &mdash; nor a succession plan for the advisors.</p><h3> ENSEMBLE ADVANTAGE <br/>  </h3><p> The team-based culture of the ensemble service model is where I see future growth for the industry. These firms are multi-advisor businesses that deliver products and services as a team, using pooled resources and profits.</p><p> Clients are shared and are viewed as belonging to the firm. That in turn drives compensation, which is typically in alignment with the firm&rsquo;s overall strategy and goals and initiatives. <br/> Principals can spend more time with clients by pushing down work that can be completed by junior team members. That also frees up time for new business development &mdash; something I hear every firm say it needs more time for.</p><p> The ensemble model tends to improve the firm&rsquo;s flexibility. Various team members can be brought together &mdash; based on both capacity and skill sets &mdash; to address a particular client&rsquo;s needs. The firm can tap individual staffers&rsquo; technical strengths to deliver better support and service.</p><p> Along the way, clients become accustomed to dealing with a number of team members. Clients get access and support in a timely manner, and because they are not wedded to discussing all matters with a single principal, simple requests can be fielded by junior staff members &mdash; again increasing the principals&rsquo; capacity to focus on revenue generation.</p><p> There&rsquo;s another advantage to ensemble models from a human capital perspective. Often the most valuable employees are also those looking for opportunities to expand their skills and advance their careers.</p><p> For these employees, the team model provides a career path. If implemented successfully, the model can help advisors attract and retain key talent &mdash; and, potentially, create internal succession options.</p><h3> ORGANIZATIONAL SHIFTS <br/>  </h3><p> At my consulting practice, I often hear from firms that want to move toward an ensemble structure.</p><p> One of our past clients came to my consulting firm for help when she realized that her organizational structure lacked scalability. As the founder and sole owner of an RIA with $2.8 million in revenue, she was wearing too many hats: CEO, rainmaker, lead advisor, manager. She found this overload of roles was holding her back; she had virtually stopped bringing on new clients and new revenue.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> At the time, she had two senior advisors reporting to her who had responsibility for servicing her existing book of clients, but they were not generating new revenue. We recommended that she move to an ensemble structure by hiring a junior-level advisor, creating a team approach to serve the clients. This provided leverage for the two senior advisors, freeing some of their time to develop new business.</p><p> In addition, she hired a dedicated chief operating officer to help her manage the firm on a day-to-day basis and support strategic growth initiatives. Our client plans to begin shifting to a part-time role in the next five to seven years, so her new COO is also a potential future owner and internal successor.</p><h3> WHEN TO HIRE <br/>  </h3><p> One of the most difficult organizational questions for advisors is when to make the next hire &mdash; before a firm maxes out its capacity, or afterward? A secondary challenge: Should principals hire an experienced advisor with a book of clients, or invest in a junior person who can be trained to learn the firm&rsquo;s way of doing things?</p><p> Remember, staff additions are most effective when they contribute to greater leverage at the advisor level, freeing a professional&rsquo;s time to work directly with clients and prospects.</p><p> Depending on where a firm is in its evolutionary stage and chosen practice model, leverage will look different for different firms, but this overall concept holds true across the industry.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> GUIDING PRINCIPLES <br/>  </h3><p> When designing your organizational structure for growth, be sure to abide by the following principles.</p><li> Increase role clarity with your team. With greater role clarity and focus, team members know their roles well and become more competent and productive in the way they approach their work.</li><li> Define the functions and create both job descriptions and clear goals, so that all members of the team know what is expected of them.</li><li> Increase the specialization and the depth of skill that is needed to serve your clients. Ensure that every advisory position can focus on both the delivery of advice and revenue-generating activities in order to drive growth.</li><li> Build operational capabilities, adding dedicated managers if necessary, to free advisors from the day-to-day work of running the firm.</li><li> Keep your team focused on delivering advice and service. Even support staff should be focused on relationships with external clients, and should understand how their roles support your firm&rsquo;s preferred client experience.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-13 15:47:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-13 15:47:21.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_OpB76yC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-your-organizational-structure-and-human-capital-practices-helping-you-grow/\", \"post_id\": \"12441\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-13 15:47:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-13 15:47:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-your-organizational-structure-and-human-capital-practices-helping-you-grow\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12440\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6043\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/your-organizational-structure-and-human-capital-practices-helping-you-grow.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1337\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468483200,"author_id":270,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5805,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Bitcoin and Micropayments are the Future of Content Delivery","link":"how-bitcoin-and-micropayments-are-the-future-of-content-delivery","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Admit it.</p><p> You hate the ads that you're forced to watch on YouTube before can see the video you want. You just suck it up and lose 5-30 seconds of your life (which you&rsquo;ll never get back) just so that you can watch a video that was probably not even worth the time lost.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s another thing you probably hate - having to pay a set amount each month for a subscription to a service which we often find we haven&rsquo;t fully utilized when the bill comes due.</p><p> But, what option do we have?</p><p> Fortunately, that&rsquo;s usually the kind of question that makes innovators and visionaries create disruptive technologies and products.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> One of those disruptive technologies has been Bitcoin and Blockchain. The ability for Bitcoin to be used as a worldwide payment method continues to disrupt payment systems throughout the world.</p><p> Another disruption that is impacting businesses is related to the publishing model. The rise of free access to content through the internet has led to a collapse in sales and readership for the traditional media outlets of newspapers and magazines.</p><p> The benefit of this free access to the viewer has come with an onslaught of digital ads, loss of privacy and continued tracking across all of our web browsing. It has also led to a loss of many media outlets and impacted the livelihood of many writers.</p><h3> Micro and Nanopayments <br/>  </h3><p> A potential solution that could benefit our overall experience of gaining media without these strings and negative impacts may reside in the concept of micro and nanopayments.  At its simplest form, a micropayment relates to paying a small amount for the opportunity to watch a video or read an article of our choosing. Rather than wasting our time watching an ad, or paying a monthly subscription, we have the ability to simply pay for what we want to consume. If there&rsquo;s an article on the New York Times that we want to read, we would simply pay a small amount to read that.  If there&rsquo;s a video on YouTube that we want to watch, we would simply pay a small amount to watch only that and not an ad for dish detergent.</p><p> Although it seems simple and applicable, the reality is that these experiences would need to process small amounts of money.  After all, you&rsquo;d only pay a few cents for an article or to view a video. Credit card companies are not interested in processing those amounts so you simply get saddled with the much easier (for them) subscription model.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Pay in Satoshis? <br/>  </h3><p> This is a place where Bitcoin can play a great role.  In a dollar-denominated system, a penny is the lowest form of value, and it takes 100 pennies to make up a dollar.  Bitcoin's lowest value is called a Satoshi and it takes 100,000,000 Satoshis to make up one full Bitcoin.  Therefore, the ability to create nanopayments is much easier with Bitcoins and Satoshis.  Plus the transfer of Satoshis and Bitcoins can be effected quicker and more efficiently.</p><p> A major player in the micro and nanopayment model is appropriately called  <a href=\"http://satoshipay.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SatoshiPay </a> . The system allows for any desired content to be immediately paid from one person&rsquo;s Bitcoin wallet into another&rsquo;s.  It may be the solution to save not only the publishing model, but has implications for the music and video industry as well.</p><p> SatoshiPay grew out a second place win at the 2015 Coinbase BitHack v2 when they won $5,000 for their product which is a &ldquo;bitcoin nanopayment wall for publishers which allows you to pay for the section of text that really interests you, make metered payments for streaming video, and make paid downloads with a single click.&rdquo; </p><p> Since that time, they&rsquo;ve achieved additional funding including an investment from Jim Mellon  who&rsquo;s also known as the English version of Warren Buffett. </p><h3> Available on a Wide Range of Platforms <br/>  </h3><p> Up until this past week, SatsohiPay was available for WordPress websites through a WordPress add-on. This week, the company announced that not only had they achieved 10,000 user wallets, but they were also releasing an API for use by developers that would increase their ability to gain even more users across all types of applications.</p><p> Meinhard Benn, SatoshiPay CEO was quoted in the recent press release as saying, &ldquo;We have been delighted by the response we&rsquo;ve received from the developer community and we&rsquo;re excited to announce the API. Our mission is to enable developers to use SatoshiPay for any kind of digital product or service they want to implement nanopayments into. We believe this will enable us to significantly scale our reach as developers can use our system in any way they can dream. We will continue to add features frequently to support our growing ecosystem of developers and partners&rdquo;.</p><p> The ability for SatoshiPay to gain a wide foothold may be an uphill battle against those who desire, and benefit from the existing ad and subscription based platform that delivers content.</p><p> With wider implementation of SatoshiPay and an improved user experience, we may one day be able to avoid watching a dish detergent ad in order to see our favorite cat video.

That&rsquo;s my obligation to all the people who believe in me. We all have to take defeats in life.&rdquo; - Muhammad Ali</p><p> As with most leadership challenges, there&rsquo;s hardly a better strategy for helping your team lose well than asking great questions. Here are a few questions to get you started.</p><h3> 1) What are we feeling now and why?  <br/>  </h3><p> Chances are this will be met with crickets&ndash;wait for it. Linger. Discuss. Process. Shut the door. Allow emotion. Before you open the door. It&rsquo;s okay to share that you&rsquo;re disappointed too, but do your best to role model a calm exploration and discussion of your feelings.</p><h3> 2) What are we most proud of? <br/>  </h3><p> Even the worst defeats generally come with moments of success, smart plays, and even ingenious effort. Help your team to step back and celebrate the elements of good.</p><h3> 3) What must we do to show up as gracious losers?</h3><p> <br/> In order to win well the next time, it&rsquo;s so important to not show up as bad sports. Help your team brainstorm the mostimportant behaviors here. Perhaps it&rsquo;s a congratulatory phone call or two, or a simple offering of &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo; Remember Winning Well is a marathon.</p><h3> 4) What can we learn here? <br/>  </h3><p> This is the most important question, but resist the urge to jump in and start with this one. You&rsquo;ll get better thinking if you start with 1 and 2.</p><h3> 5) How can we invest in (and build bridges with) the winners? <br/>  </h3><p> Our current political arena gives us plenty of examples of how to do this well&ndash;and how to screw it up.</p><h3> 6) How do we stay focused on our MIT (Most Important Thing)? <br/>  </h3><p> You may have lost a battle, but don&rsquo;t give up on your bigger vision.

{"original_id":5807,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You a Trusted Advisor or Just a Vendor?","link":"are-you-a-trusted-advisor-or-just-a-vendor","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: TailorMade Financial</p><h3> &ldquo;Are those new glasses&hellip;&ldquo; is how the conversation starts. A father having a discussion about his son graduating to the next phase in life where making money necessitates investing through a broker. Like many things on TV, they get some things right and completely whiff on others.</h3><p> <br/> In these collection of commercials from that lovable discount brokerage that has gone Full Service (a.k.a. &ldquo;Chucky&rdquo;), the central theme is about whether one is asking enough questions about fees when it comes to investing&hellip; then closing with a tagline equating to one can do better about how their wealth is managed by visiting a website&hellip; then getting $500 when you become a client.</p><p> As noted above, half the message is on target while the other half is  way  off. Clients asking &ldquo;better&rdquo; questions about fees and other things represents a great thing and should be welcomed by all. It might be a slight change in how things work, but let us not forget that in the business world, status quo, rarely leads to longevity, so this change is a good thing.</p><p> There is no doubt that in both today and tomorrow&rsquo;s DOL world, fees and value for those fees will be a very important topic not only for the client and your business, but also for all the watchers too.</p><p> For the fee itself, there is absolutely nothing wrong for providing a service for a fee. This payment model has been around for thousands of years. As it relates to our industry, it is a relatively newer twist on the method for being compensated while providing financial services. For some advisors the fee represented by the commercial is exactly on point. It is a percentage based on the assets under management, plain and simple. This is where investment advice for a price starts and ends.</p><p> For others, the fee may start with that same percentage, yet it represents compensation for the other services delivered to their clients that go beyond just asset management. Hopefully for most, it is here that marks the distinction between being a vendor or having a relationship with your client.</p><h3> Hello Watson</h3><p> <br/> The future is here, asset allocation and basic investment decisions are all being commoditized through technology. In part, this is the heart of the commercial&rsquo;s pitch in that they can do it cheaper, which equates to a better overall value.</p><p> For those who have been around a bit, we know there will always be noticeable and very meaningful differences when comparing what individual firms can offer and deliver to their clients when it comes to actual investments and allocation since it is not all about ETFs and institutional asset managers.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The commercials might be white noise for some clients, still, that margin is being closed with each generation of intelligent hardware. Like it or not, for this subject of fee for asset management services, the writing is literally on the wall being broadcasted with every sporting event:</p><li> If you are providing a commodity you are a vendor</li><li> Price represents the featured differentiator</li><li> And, we all know, vendors are easily replaced when their services are commoditized and fungible. <br/>  </li><p> Remember, price is only an issue in the absence of value.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Opportunity Knocks, Can you Deliver</h3><p> <br/> Again, with change comes opportunity. Clients asking about fees represents a tremendous invitation for both you and that client provided that your definition of Wealth Management, unlike the commercials, encompasses a platform beyond investing and asset allocation services. As for the commercial and its closing message, to assume that Wealth Management is solely about investing and fees is a big swing and miss where we stand.</p><p> As we are fond of saying, you can get the same allocation pie chart from  any  broker. This fact is constantly being reinforced by the commercials and explosion of roboadvisors in the marketplace today. Then again, for us and most of the advisors we partner with, Wealth Management is not solely about investing and managing liquid assets, rather it is a great deal more.</p><p> In addition to a client&rsquo;s liquid wealth, knowing about and providing solutions for their illiquid wealth whether it be a closely held business or real estate coupled with their legal, tax and emotional (family) situations are equally important when it comes to addressing their goals and objectives.</p><h3> Changing One Letter</h3><p> <br/> In fact, as one goes up the wealth scale, the definition of Wealth Management becomes very clear that while investment management and the performance is important, blunting the impact of taxes and being protected from frivolous lawsuits also matters. What good are returns and performance if taxes and outside forces significantly reduce your client&rsquo;s net worth annually?</p><p> Providing a deep bench of services that transform into solutions as they relate to asset management, tax, legal, charitable, insurance, business and asset protection client matters is where the &ldquo; <strong>  vendor </strong> &rdquo; status stops and &ldquo; <strong>  relationship </strong> &rdquo; status begins.</p><p> Moreover, in providing solutions above and beyond asset management services, there is a subtle transition marked by an advisor who advises their clients than one who gives their advice on a particular topic.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> It is time to expect more from Wealth Management. It is not a man vs. machine issue, it is which human vs. which human issue. It is a reactive service model vs. a proactive service model. It is when the questions stop and when the next line of questions begin.</p><p> As a dedicated partner resource for the right advisor and right client, our role is to help you deliver enhanced and comprehensive Wealth Management solutions for your clients and your firm that works in both today  and  tomorrow&rsquo;s planning world.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-13 16:48:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-13 16:48:33.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_4s3Tbd3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-a-trusted-advisor-or-just-a-vendor/\", \"post_id\": \"12451\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-13 16:48:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-13 16:48:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-a-trusted-advisor-or-just-a-vendor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12450\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6047\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/are-you-trusted-advisor-or-just-vendor.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"860\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468486800,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5808,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Forget the Human Touch! Digitization's Value Doesn't Extend to Customer Experience","link":"dont-forget-the-human-touch-digitizations-value-doesnt-extend-to-customer-experience","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The focus of organizations of all sizes and across industries on &ldquo;Digitization&rdquo; has attracted considerable attention given the impressive impact it&rsquo;s had on productivity, cost reduction, efficiency, speed &hellip; many elements that combined create a lean and agile business infrastructure. <br/>  </h3><p> However, the customer cannot be digitized.</p><p> Customers want highly personalized experiences, often across channels and devices.</p><p> Digitization clearly plays a role. Customers often expect immediate access to information specific to their interests. However, per Accenture Strategy&rsquo;s Global Consumer Pulse Research (1), 73% of U.S. consumers prefer dealing with a human being vs. a digital channel to solve customer service issues.</p><h3> Benefits of Digital Innovation <br/>  </h3><p> Digital innovation has helped numerous companies expand their reach. Customers who value the price advantage, convenience and access available via digital channels are also happy. Per Accenture (1), 88% of customers use digital channels at some point in their shopping process. In fact, 41% want more digital interactions.</p><h3> Where Digital Has Gone Too Far <br/>  </h3><p> Accenture&rsquo;s research (1) found digital has not enhanced customer loyalty. Lack of loyalty is prominent in retail, banking and internet service providers &ndash; early digital adopters. In these sectors, 65% of customers moved all or part of their business in 2014. Reason for switching?</p><p> Poor customer service.</p><p> It&rsquo;s difficult to discern the line between just right and too much. Companies reach customers with frequent digital messages and promotions. Customers, however, become irritated when they consider contacts too frequent &ndash; preventing sales.</p><p> While digital is definitely a desirable component for many consumers, those who engage with companies/brands across multiple channels are more profitable customers (3).</p><h3> Digital&rsquo;s Strongest Benefits? <br/>  </h3><p> Digitization is absolutely a huge innovation spreading throughout the business world to achieve objectives such as efficiency, cost reduction, increased speed and predictive analytics. It&rsquo;s also the driver of greatly enhanced connectivity, not only computers, but across many types of machines.</p><p> Perhaps digitization&rsquo;s most important role is within manufacturing, and other businesses where the benefits described above (and others) are substantial drivers of a company&rsquo;s ability to be competitive and positioned for future success.</p><p> From a customer perspective, maybe the best utilization of digitization is in the background, enabling people &ndash; directly helping customers &ndash; to have the information they need at their fingertips to provide customers with the hyper-personalization in products and services they desire. This includes customers who expect omni-channel shopping experiences, as they switch back and forth between digital and in-person elements.</p><p> Over-reliance on digital interactions also limits the ability to upsell and cross-sell, both of which are far more successful in purchases with human interactions. As well, digital efficiencies created cost savings. When those were passed on to consumers it created a consumer mindset to expect ongoing discounts and promotions &ndash; hurting gross margins.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Examples: <br/>  </h3><p> NIKEiD (1): An online shoemaking service that enables customers to create a one-of-a-kind pair of shoes. Customers control all aspects from design to performance features. For them, it&rsquo;s as if they are collaborating with their own personal shoemaker, who&rsquo;s &ldquo;committed to bringing their unique vision to life.&rdquo;</p><p> Facebook (2): Algorithms rule at Facebook! Algorithms review approximately 100,000 signals to create a &ldquo;relevancy score&rdquo; for each post from a user. However, it is people who make judgments about what to show Facebook&rsquo;s 1.6 billion users and how.</p><h3> Looking Forward <br/>  </h3><p> Connected is a key term today. Connectivity enhancements within business operations result in major benefits. Connected in the personal sense enables optimal human interactions that both address customers&rsquo; high expectations and increase company revenues and profits. Employees&rsquo; ability to upsell, cross-sell and employ other customized insight is made possible by superior deployment of customer data like predictive analytics and similar capabilities.</p><h3> Recalibrating Actions: <br/>  </h3><li> Evaluate all customer touchpoints. Do all of them incorporate human interaction? If not, how can they be revised to use the company&rsquo;s technology as support for direct human interaction with customers?</li><li> Survey employees with direct customer contact. Is there anything they perceive as lacking to meet &ndash; or exceed customers&rsquo; needs/requests?</li><li> Ask these same employees whether there are potential opportunities to provide additional products and/or services to these customers? Help them think more broadly based on potential products/services currently under consideration and added-value products and/or services provided by consumer companies they know.</li><li> Do employees believe they have everything they need to upsell and/or cross-sell? Are sales increasing in situations of upselling/cross-selling? Ensure employees understand the value to the company and appropriate incentives are in place.</li><li> Do these same employees feel empowered to do whatever is necessary to &ldquo;make it right&rdquo; for their customers? To what extent are they empowered?</li><p> Sources: <br/> <br/> 1.

{"original_id":5809,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Points for Leading High Potential Employees","link":"4-points-for-leading-high-potential-employees","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Q: Our board of directors has a focus on developing employees and building bench strength. To that end, HR has developed a program for high potentials. They have provided criteria for the selection process. But they have been vague on how best to manage them. They suggest two things: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Challenge high potentials in a variety of situations and circumstances </strong></li><li> <strong>  Provide assessments on their growth regularly </strong> <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  A manager identified as &ldquo;high potential&rdquo; recently joined my team. Suggestions for leading this manager, who has a great future with the company, would be appreciated. </strong></p><h3> <br/> A: High potentials look for opportunities to increase their direct influence. They also want to take on assignments with real risks and rewards.</h3><p> <br/> As HR suggested, they should be challenged in a variety of settings and circumstances. Settings and circumstances with exposure, accountability and access are most appropriate.</p><p> The fact that your company has a high potentials&rsquo; program with board oversight is impressive. It says your company has a stake in developing and retaining its future leaders. As a leader in the company, you have a responsibility to prepare this manager and other high potentials for advancement.</p><h3> 4 points for consideration in managing High Potentials:</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  1. Planning Session </strong></h3><p> <br/> A one-on-one session is a good starting point. This starting point involves you both in his professional development. During this session, you can gain an appreciation for his accomplishments and aspirations. An open and direct two-way dialog will help you do two things:</p><li> Assess how his interests can best be balanced within your team</li><li> Target assignments to help him grow toward his potential <br/>  </li><p> High potentials want to know that the company is investing in them. Involving him in a brainstorming session about areas of focus and potential assignments is vital. It will illustrate that he has a hand in the way he develops and his career unfolds. It will also let him know that the company is taking his grooming seriously.</p><h3>  </h3><h3> <strong>  2. Autonomy </strong></h3><p> <br/> The endowment effect suggests that when people take ownership, they immediately value it more. To that end, give this manger ownership. High potentials flourish when they are truly responsible for something. That means you should facilitate, not direct, his ability to succeed. The following are &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; for giving him autonomy:</p><li> Unleash his intuition, creativity and business acumen</li><li> Give him freedom to make decisions and own his assignments</li><li> Empower him to deliver and make an impression</li><li> Recognize that mistakes provide learning</li><li> Coach and support his growth</li><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <br/> <strong>  3. Scaffolding </strong></h3><p> <br/> In construction, scaffolding expands to reach new heights. The same is true in business. Scaffolding will help him stretch beyond his comfort zone and learn new skills. The stretch assignment should help set the stage for more responsibility and expanded leadership experiences.</p><p> The three Ws will give you insights on what constitutes a stretch assignment.</p><li> Where he has been</li><li> When assignments leveraged learning</li><li> What he aspire to do next <br/>  </li><p> By building upon the three Ws, you help develop his leadership abilities and other skills necessary for career advancement.</p><p> Tips for stretch assignments include:</p><li> Connecting assignments with goals and learning</li><li> Finding opportunities for education specific to his grooming</li><li> Gearing assignments toward selection and advancement decisions</li><li> Thinking about visibility but not letting it be the driver</li><li> Planning ways to give exposure <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  4. Communication </strong></h3><p> <br/> Frequent communication is essential. Scheduled one-on-one sessions and impromptu conversations will keep the lines of communication open. The conversations should be aimed at developing attributes he will need for advancement. Specifically, they should center around:</p><li> Providing feedback on behaviors</li><li> Tracking progress with autonomy</li><li> Discussing learning from the scaffolding <br/>  </li><p> The on-going dialogs will let him know he matters to the company. And frequent talks about his growth and development ensure they are being fostered and managed.</p><p> High potentials generally have a greater appetite for feedback, both constructive and positive. The blog post,  <a href=\"http://www.terrideuel.com/leadership/developing-vs-correcting-constructive-feedback/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Developing versus Correcting with Constructive Feedback </a> , provides information on a behavioral feedback format.

{"original_id":5810,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Key to Beating the Skill Gap and Meeting Industry Demands","link":"the-key-to-beating-the-skill-gap-and-meeting-industry-demands","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Today creating effective learning and development programs is even more important than ever. Information collected in the latest &lsquo;Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey&rsquo; by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics has revealed a significant inconsistency in the market.</p><p> While the number of job openings has hit an all time high since the recession, the number of hires isn&rsquo;t matching up. Experts are attributing this to a major skill gap in the market. Employers are now having trouble finding applicants with the skills they're looking for.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hires.png\" width=\"400\"/></p><p> <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/labor-market-skills-gap-widening-2016-5?r=US&amp;IR=T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Business Insider </a> /Andy Kiersz, data from FRED</p><p> In effect, this means that job openings are remaining unfilled for much longer than usual. According to a study conducted by CareerBuilder, a company loses more than $14,000 for every job that stays vacant for three months or longer. In fact, one in six companies lose $25,000 or more.</p><p> Simply raising salaries to attract more candidates is not the answer. Talent acquisition specialists are now realizing that they&rsquo;ll have to reassess what they're looking for in an employee and turn to HR to do the rest. Sixty-four percent of employers who participated in a CareerBuilder study indicated they would be hiring people who have the majority of the skills they&rsquo;re looking for and train them to do the rest.</p><p> The surprising thing is that evidence of a skill gap is not news. Experts have been discussing the US skills shortage since 2014 but companies have been resistant to revive aging L&amp;D programs based on four misconceptions:</p><h3> Meeting industry demands <br/>  </h3><p> Some are concerned that diverting time and resources to training and development will put them behind competitors. What they don&rsquo;t realize is that high performing learning organizations are 92% more likely to innovate, 58% more prepared to meet future demand and 46% more likely to be first to market.</p><p> Rather than having a workforce that is highly skilled in one area, companies today need more flexible employees. With rapidly changing technology and industry trends, Deloitte reported that current job skills only have a life of 2 &frac12; to 5 years. This means that even if companies find talent with the exact skills they need, this will change quickly. In effect, what companies really need are candidates who are able to learn and adapt to changing business strategies quickly. To meet these demands, HR departments are putting a stronger focus on reinventing L&amp;D programs to fit the modern learner.</p><h3> Millennials are disloyal <br/>  </h3><p> The common stereotype about millennials is that they&rsquo;re extremely disloyal and highly demanding, hopping from job to job over the span of a few years. While it&rsquo;s true that millennials demand more from employers, they&rsquo;re also prepared to give more. When given the right tools and environment to grow they can bring their tech charged, collaborative and innovative skills to the workplace.</p><p> Millennials have a desire to learn and develop constantly. Accenture&rsquo;s US College Graduate Employment Study found that 80% of the class of 2016 expect their first employer to provide formal training, yet only 54% of graduates from the classes of 2014-5 reported receiving any. This represents a great disconnect between what employers are providing and what the millennial workforce expects.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Millennials are usually multi-skilled and want room to develop their wide array of talents. However, the rigidity of traditional job descriptions and department specific training often makes it easier to apply for a new job in a different field than to move laterally within an organization. Why source talent for each skill when instead you can source talent from inside your organization?</p><h3> There&rsquo;s always next year <br/>  </h3><p> L&amp;D is also a major concern for training the new generation of leaders in your company. The fact is that by 2020 millennials will make up half of the global workforce. Your Millennial employees are fast beginning to fill the resulting management gap. The question is are they ready?</p><p> Deloitte&rsquo;s 2015 study on Millennials revealed that only 24% of recent graduates felt that leadership was a strong personal trait of theirs. Yet, the 2016 survey showed that companies were not doing much to change this. Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that their leadership skills are not being developed at work. This was a particular concern amongst those who are planning on leaving their current company within the next two years.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> L&amp;D programs are expensive and ineffective <br/>  </h3><p> According to The Association for Talent Development, in 2013 companies spent on average $1,208 per employee on training and development. CareerBuilder found that 68% of companies are investing in in-house training programs. However, according to Deloitte, only 37% of companies believe their programs are effective. Almost all CEOs and CHROs believe their company is not developing skills fast enough or deep enough. Do traditional training programs fit the needs of the modern learner?</p><h3> The tech generation&rsquo;s solution to aging L&amp;D programs <br/>  </h3><p> The new workforce is made up of digital natives. They&rsquo;re used to receiving information instantly and on the go. PWC found that 41% of millennials prefer to communicate electronically at the office rather than face to face or over the phone. Raised on Facebook and Twitter, they prefer using more collaborative learning solutions that allow them to give and receive development advice from both managers and peers.</p><p> Rather than having HR spend time and money on devising expensive formal classes, companies are now investing in new HR tech tools that fuse millennials&rsquo; not so secret attachment to their smartphone with their desire for real-time learning. Instead of pushing managers to be more proactive with their coaching responsibilities, Impraise gives employees ownership over their own development by allowing them to ask for feedback on the skills they want, when they want. The system instantly generates people analytics driven reports that allow HR to track progress and see improvement over time.

And many firms stridently cling to the belief that clients&mdash;both current and past&mdash;are their primary source for those much-needed referrals.  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/referral-marketing-study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  After a closer look </a> , we found this faith in clients as a referral source to be wrong.</p><p> According to a survey of 500 professional services companies, people who have never worked with your firm&mdash;strangers&mdash;are likely your top referral source.</p><p> As I asked in a recent  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/01/the-no-1-source-of-referrals-for-a-high-growth-business.html\" target=\"_blank\">  CNBC post </a> , why would complete strangers be a good referral source for a firm?</p><p> When we asked those making the referrals, the majority said it was because of the company&rsquo;s reputation or  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/rethinking-referral-marketing-demonstrate-your-expertise\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  visible expertise </a> . In fact, the visibility of a firm&rsquo;s expertise is the single most important factor in someone making a referral.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/referral-probability.png\" width=\"636\"/></p><p> Many referrers first become aware of a company&rsquo;s capabilities when they hear one of their experts speak at a conference or read a blog posts or article that demonstrated the firm&rsquo;s knowledge. In other words, the firm had made their expertise visible to the outside world.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/referral-marketing-for-professional-services-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  In earlier research </a> , we noted that perceived expertise is the most important criterion when selecting a new professional services provider. We now know that certain activities drive that perception. As you can see from Figure 2, some types of visible expertise are more important than others. Especially if someone has never worked with the firm before.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/visible-expertise.png\" width=\"671\"/></p><p> Of course, strangers who hear you speak at a conference or read a compelling blog post are not your only source for referrals. You cannot discount the value of professional relationships and reciprocity when cultivating possible referral sources.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Relationships Still Matter</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/the-top-10-benefits-of-using-social-media-marketing-for-business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Social and professional relationships </a>  are important. In fact, they account for nearly 18% of referral sources. Not surprisingly, referrals often result when a social and professional relationship intersect. Of course, our research also demonstrated that social relationships in the absence of any direct knowledge of your expertise will do you little good.</p><p> Cultivating friends at noncompeting firms is another way to develop a referral source. These complementary contacts are often more than happy to send business to a reputable firm they know. For instance, an accountant who works on a specific kind of financial transaction is often happy to refer a client to a knowledgeable attorney who also has expertise in such deals.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Reciprocity Really Works</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Making </strong>  referrals can pay dividends, too. In fact, the more referrals a firm makes, the more it is likely to receive. The reality is givers gain&mdash;and the numbers back it up.</p><p> When we asked people to tell us how many referrals they had given and received in the previous 6 months, we found some interesting correlations. On average, people had given an average of 7.2 referrals and received 7.0. The top 20% of those acting as a referral source had given an average of 17.9 referrals and received 21.8.</p><h3> Clients Still Need the Love</h3><p> <br/> Existing customers are still a good source of referrals for professional services firms, with about 80% of clients willing to refer their current service provider to others.</p><p> When  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/why-your-technology-services-firm-cant-rely-on-word-of-mouth-for-new-busine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  word-of-mouth marketing </a>  from satisfied customers is the main way a firm spreads the word, however, the number of referrals it can receive is limited by the number of clients it has. This means firms with better known, more visible brands have a larger pool of potential referrals.</p><h3> Give Up the Tried and True</h3><p> <br/> Some firms still try to raise the visibility of their firms, not by exhibiting their expertise, but by sponsoring tables at industry conferences and sending employees to networking events. In light of our research, this is a poor allocation of precious BD money. Sponsorships result in less than 1% of referrals. And networking does little more, representing just 3.4% of referral sources.</p><h3> Closing Thought</h3><p> <br/> Unfortunately, no matter how hard you make your expertise known not all referrals you receive will lead to new business. Nearly 52% of referred prospects rule out a referred service provider without even talking with them. And there are a wide variety of factors that could tip the scale against a firm.</p><p> Perhaps the referred prospect Googled the firm and couldn&rsquo;t find any information about its experts. Or maybe a customer was unimpressed with or frustrated by the firm&rsquo;s website.</p><p> Fortunately, such deficiencies in visibility and perceived expertise are easily addressed. It all goes back to building up your firm&rsquo;s visible expertise. You&rsquo;ll win a lot more referrals by showcasing your best work, knowledge, and past performance.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-13 17:26:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-13 17:26:49.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_ngfHXYb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-clients-are-not-the-referral-source-to-count-on/\", \"post_id\": \"12462\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-13 17:26:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-13 17:26:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-clients-are-not-the-referral-source-to-count-on\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12459\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6052\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-clients-are-not-referral-source-count.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"542\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468490400,"author_id":300,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5812,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Will Content Marketing Replace BDMs?","link":"will-content-marketing-replace-bdms","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> A recent client strategy met a somewhat controversial brief: &ldquo;Create a marketing strategy that means I don&rsquo;t need a business development manager (BDM).&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Is this the way of the future? Maybe, maybe not. But there are certainly plenty of reasons it could be a possibility.</p><p> First of all, BDMs can only persuade a prospect while they are in the room. Content marketing on the other hand keeps working when you, or your sales force can&rsquo;t be there in person. As a respected colleague said to me this morning, &ldquo;How do you stake your claim and defend it, when your sales ability relies on being more charming than the next guy they meet?&rdquo;</p><p> The whole point of an integrated, planned and sustained content marketing program is that it keeps you in front of your audience, delivering value and owning their mental real estate while you are not physically present.</p><p> Here are some other reasons BDMs might go the way of the Dodo (or the PR practitioner!):</p><li> A BDM&rsquo;s ability to influence their prospect &ndash; the adviser &ndash; is limited by the amount of face time they can get. In the increasingly time poor world of busy advisers, this face time is shrinking.</li><li> While the older cohort of advisers value the golf day, many younger (more educated!) advisers are much more transactional in their relationships with managers and seek commercial value in every interaction. Content can deliver this value. In fact it must. BDMs can fall into the trap of focusing all about the relationship &ndash; not the utility they deliver in the conversation.</li><li> Content is reusable. While advisers do glean gems from their conversations with a BDM that they can share with clients, educational and valuable content from a fund manager can easily be passed onto clients or repackaged by the adviser, whether in a conversation or email. It is much harder to replay a conversation with a BDM and still get it right. <br/>  </li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Content marketing isn&rsquo;t actually that new, it&rsquo;s just the right combination of all of the existing marketing tools with a stronger filter on the front end. That stronger filter is very simple &ndash; it should deliver adviser and client value. If it doesn&rsquo;t it shouldn&rsquo;t be in your marketing plan anyway. The ideal outcome, then, is for content marketing and BDMs to work hand in hand, with content marketing running from the beginning of the prospecting process right through to customer retention. Both BDMs and content marketing have a role to play in this process (at least in wealth management) for the foreseeable future.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-13 18:28:42.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-13 18:28:42.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/will-content-marketing-replace-bdms.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/will-content-marketing-replace-bdms/\", \"post_id\": \"12464\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-13 18:28:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-13 18:28:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"will-content-marketing-replace-bdms\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12463\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6053\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/will-content-marketing-replace-bdms.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1172\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468486800,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

How the Snooze Button Affects Your Sleep","link":"snoozing-or-losing-how-the-snooze-button-affects-your-sleep","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I am often asked by my patients if it is okay to keep hitting the snooze button for those extra zzzz&rsquo;s. They want to know if it is beneficial or detrimental. My answer is &ldquo;ask yourself why do you need to do that and does it really make you feel better&rdquo;? In reality, it may not only be a sign of inadequate or poor quality sleep, but it can make functioning during the day even more difficult.</p><h3> In many instances, you may be suffering from what we call social jet lag.</h3><p> <br/> You sleep much longer on weekends but on weekdays, given the pressure of a job or family, you can&rsquo;t. Hitting the snooze alarm is a fruitless effort to obtain the sleep that you really need.</p><p> When you hit the snooze alarm, you are disrupting your current stage of sleep. Unfortunately, in many ways, fragmented sleep is worse than no sleep. As an example, if you are in REM sleep and you interrupt it with the snooze alarm, this can lead to an inability to process and reconcile emotionally laden memories from the previous day. In addition, fragmented sleep can result in moodiness, cognitive problems, and trouble paying attention.</p><p> What can we do to avoid this? First, we must realize that in many cases our body is telling us that we are not getting enough sleep. Try going to bed one-half hour earlier. Turn off all blue light emitting devices at least one hour before bedtime. Blue light delays the production of melatonin that results in lingering amounts of the sleep hormone in your blood stream upon awakening. Is it any wonder you can&rsquo;t wake up?</p><p> Other remedies include putting the alarm clock where you cannot reach it; using alarm clocks that work by putting out ever-increasing amounts of light as wake-up time approaches; having a coffee maker with a timer set for ten minutes before wake time and close enough so that you can smell it. Even getting a device that can automatically increase your bedroom temperature about one hour before it is time to get up can be helpful, as rising body temperature is another signal to wake up.</p><h3> The bottom line is that if you chronically find the need to hit the snooze alarm, something is probably wrong.</h3><p> <br/> You may be out of sync with your internal circadian clock. You may be a night owl trying to keep the work schedule of a morning lark. You may be someone who is failing at attempting to burn the candle at both ends. Alternatively, you may have a sleep disorder that unbeknownst to you is disrupting and depriving you of quality sleep. Hitting the snooze button is a poor substitute for healthy sleep.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-13 18:33:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-13 18:33:07.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_cM0743r.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/snoozing-or-losing-how-the-snooze-button-affects-your-sleep/\", \"post_id\": \"12466\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-13 18:33:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-13 18:33:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"snoozing-or-losing-how-the-snooze-button-affects-your-sleep\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12465\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6054\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/snoozing-or-losing-how-snooze-button-affects-your-sleep.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1111\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468522800,"author_id":157,"chart_url":""}

He's Changed and So Has the World's Preeminent Large-Cap Growth Index","link":"you-know-that-nerd-from-high-school-hes-changed-and-so-has-the-worlds-preeminent-large-cap-growth-index","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Rob Hughes, Head of Index &amp; Advisor Solutions, Nasdaq Global Information Services</p><p> Perceptions can be hard to change. Sometimes we think we know something based on the way it used to be, but in reality, our perceptions might be rooted in outdated facts and information. Whether you&rsquo;re talking about someone you knew 30 years ago (who wants to be judged for what they did in high school?) or something that seems much less subjective like a famous index  &mdash; when you&rsquo;re known for being a certain way, it can be hard to make a new impression.</p><p> In much the same way, the <a href=\"http://business.nasdaq.com/campaigns/nasdaq-100/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nasdaq-100 </a> &mdash; today&rsquo;s leading global large-cap growth index 1 &mdash; can be stuck in outdated perceptions. The Nasdaq-100 provides exposure to the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq , and while many still think of it as a tech-focused or even tech-exclusive index, that&rsquo;s far from today&rsquo;s reality.</p><h3> A history rooted in tech</h3><p> <br/> While the index has never been limited to tech stocks, at its inception just over three decades ago, Nasdaq&rsquo;s highest growth performers were many of the tech heavyweights of the day. In 1985, Technology, as defined by the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), was the largest industry in the Nasdaq-100. However, the 23 technology companies only made up 23% of the market cap weight within the index. The largest stock was Wall Street&rsquo;s tech darling, <a href=\"http://www.intel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Intel </a> ; <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Apple </a> was high on the list, although it did not yet hold the leadership position it occupies today.</p><p> The tech boom of the mid-1990s helped perpetuate the idea that the Nasdaq-100 was a &ldquo;tech index.&rdquo; By November 1998, with the tech-driven bull market in full force, technology stocks accounted for an unprecedented 70% of the market cap of the index. By the early 2000s, tech stocks continued to dominate the index. Tech continued its prominence into the next decade. Even as recent as 2011, when tech companies were the driving force in the recovery of the financial crisis, technology represented 61.6% of the index market cap.</p><p> What is not widely known, however, is that Consumer Services and Industrials have played a close second and third place at 21% and 15% respectively at time of inception. Some notable non-tech firms that were included at the launch were <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HBO </a> , <a href=\"http://www.katespadeandcompany.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Liz Claiborne </a> , <a href=\"http://www.macktrucks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mack Trucks </a> , and <a href=\"http://www.mccormick.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  McCormick Spices </a> .</p><h3> Today&rsquo;s view: a diversified index built on growth</h3><p> <br/> Today, the Nasdaq-100 still exhibits a solid base of technology &mdash; currently accounting for 51.67% of the index market cap weight. Compared to the S&amp;P 500, with just 17.25% of its weight attributed to technology stocks, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with 14.15%, the Nasdaq-100 undoubtedly has a stronger tilt towards technology stocks.  <strong>  However, this tilt is not thematic in nature, but rather the result of the preeminent position of technology stocks in today&rsquo;s economy and the strong growth enjoyed by the leaders in this sector </strong> , such as Apple, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Microsoft </a> , <a href=\"http://www.alphabet.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Alphabet </a> ,   <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Facebook </a> , NetEase and Baidu. Moreover, the index also includes many of today&rsquo;s most innovative companies in fast-growing sectors such as biotech ( <a href=\"http://www.gilead.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gilead Sciences </a> , <a href=\"http://www.amgen.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Amgen </a> , and <a href=\"http://www.celgene.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Celgene </a> ), retail ( <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Amazon </a> and <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Starbucks </a> ), media ( <a href=\"http://www.comcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Comcast </a> and <a href=\"https://www.21cf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Twenty-First Century Fox </a> ),  industrials ( <a href=\"http://www.tesla.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Tesla </a> ), and consumer services (Ctrip).</p><p> At 31 years old, the Nasdaq-100 is not only a collection of innovative, market-driving companies, but also a highly successful basis for tradable products. After adjusting its index weights to ensure compliance with IRS RIC diversification rules, Nasdaq launched the first ETF tied to the Nasdaq-100 index in March 1999 with a per-share asset value of about $100. Called the QQQ ETF, the fund experienced tremendous growth during its first few months of operation. Just one year later, fund assets reached $10 Billion. The Nasdaq-100&rsquo;s sustained growth has earned it a reputation as a valuable hedging tool and source of exposure to tech and growth-oriented stocks.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Though its composition has changed considerably over the years, the Nasdaq-100 continues to represent many of today&rsquo;s younger, game-changing, and growth-oriented companies. Despite its long-standing reputation as a &ldquo;tech index,&rdquo; the Nasdaq-100 has proven itself to be so much more. Now serving as a basis for investable products in 27 countries worldwide and as the foundation for the Invesco PowerShares&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/portal/site/us/financial-professional/etfs/product-detail?productId=QQQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  QQQ ETF </a> , this well-rounded index is a valuable tool for growth-focused investors worldwide.</p><p> So while you may still think of that kid you knew back in high school as being an awkward nerd, he may very well now be the suave executive of a successful company. People evolve and so too has this iconic index. The Nasdaq-100&rsquo;s roots in tech have helped it evolve into the index that now tracks some of the most innovative and healthy brands leading this modern economy forward.</p> <p> To learn more about the Nadaq-100, <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/Nasdaq_100_White_Paper?source=OtherWebsite&amp;sd=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  download the whitepaper The Nasdaq-100: Tracking Innovation in Large-Cap Growth </a> .</p><p> <a href=\"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite#!?tag=Indexes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Read more </a> from Nasdaq Global Indexes.</p>Nasdaq&reg; is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.

Household income in this age group took a big hit, and now most people don&rsquo;t have even $100k saved for retirement.</p><p> See, retirement won&rsquo;t be the same for our generation. Our parents had the government and their employers&rsquo; defined benefit plans to fund their golden years. The employer did the math and the employee was on cruise control. It&rsquo;s different for Gen X and Y because in the age of the 401k you are the one driving. You need some investment skill in order to allocate your money intelligently to the fund options on the 401k menu. Gen X needs to step up to the plate, yet not enough Xers have sat down and figured out how much money they will need to retire. They are now the ones in the driver&rsquo;s seat&hellip;and it&rsquo;s going to be a rocky road ahead given that social security is on its last feeble breath and who knows what will happen with Medicare, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and every other government funded benefit that our broke country can&rsquo;t afford anymore.</p><h3> So heads up, women, because here&rsquo;s some advice on the real, from one to another.</h3><p> <br/> Considering that it is a rarity for people to stay married anymore, more women than ever before are now assuming the role of CFFO, or Chief Family Financial Officer. Yet the numbers imply that, disappointingly, many of us women expect someone else to make decisions about money for us. Unbelievable. Despite all the feminism, we are still depending on our employers to educate us about retirement. Many of us can not explicitly quantify how much money we have saved for retirement, or haven't even put together a formal plan. How shaken up would you be if you found out that the CFO of your company hadn&rsquo;t forecasted and planned out next year&rsquo;s budget? Now imagine how your kids feel about you not doing your job as CFFO.</p><h3> Women, we are growing more powerful and we need to step up to the plate when it comes to money.</h3><p> <br/> This is a clarion call to the women of Gen X and Gen Y: pay more attention to saving and investing your money because more of us are outearning men, becoming as educated as men, and finally, likely to be without a man (divorced, separated, or never married) than our mothers, aunts, and grandmothers.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t eat that $3k retail value Prada bag when you&rsquo;re 80 years old.

The metrics are limited with the free membership, but the Premium members have the ability to see the profiles of the professionals that have viewed the within the last 90 days.</p><p> At AAL, we relate the professionals that populate on this page to the physical activity of prospect walking through your front door.

I&rsquo;m willing to gamble that your response is completely different digitally than face-to-face.</p><p> When a prospect walks through your physical front door, there is a series of events that takes place before that can ever happen.

Striving to deliver great customer experiences intuitively seems like smart business, doesn&rsquo;t it? <br/>  </h3><p> Intuition, unfortunately, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily pay the bills!</p><p> So should you invest money in programs designed to improve the engagement and loyalty of your customers? If so, where should you invest for the greatest return? One needs only to look at the methodology and outcomes of Forrester Research.</p><p> Forrester has developed an annual benchmarking survey which they call the Forrester Customer Experience Index. That survey is provided to a wide swath of consumers asking them about the nature of experiences they&rsquo;ve had with companies across the industry. The survey looks at three key elements of customer experience excellence.</p><p> The degree to which customers feel a company:</p><p> Meet their Needs</p><p> Offers Ease</p><p> Makes the Experience Enjoyable</p><p> Forrester then merges data from those three aspects and calculates a singular Customer Experience Index score for every company. Overall results suggest that most companies are receiving very mediocre scores on the index.</p><p> Forrester has actually calculated a performance level which they call &ldquo;the green line of goodness.&rdquo; That line differentiates between sub-par performance and excellent customer experiences. Companies who perform above the green line of goodness enjoy a number of remarkable financial outcomes and customer relationship benefits. By asking loyalty questions and researching the financial performance of those above and below the green line of goodness, Forrester finds that:</p><p> The higher the Customer Experience Index score, the more likely a customer will consider another purchase or recommend a friend or family member to a business.</p><p> The lower the Customer Experience Index score, the more likely a customer will consider switching to another brand.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Modeling the business value of higher Customer Experience Index scores, Forrester estimates millions of dollars in annual incremental revenue for &ldquo;any company in any category&rdquo; they survey.</p><p> In industries like hotels and wireless service, the annual incremental revenue boost is calculated as &ldquo;BILLIONS&rdquo; of dollars.</p><p> If your customers were asked would you find your business above Forrester&rsquo;s &ldquo;Green Line of Goodness?&rdquo;</p><p> In any case, it pays to invest in efforts to more effectively meet your customers&rsquo; needs in a manner that makes it as easy as possible for them.

One of the better models, of a higher perspective, proved to be Strategic Selling. <br/>  </h3><p> It taught us to deliberately choose those accounts with which we wished to work. Today, we have social selling that translates into establishing brand awareness on social media. The two models combined becomes a powerful strategy.</p><p> Work with your preferred clientele through research as you establish a recognized brand.  </p><h3> My Story <br/>  </h3><p> Sales representatives are traditionally assigned territories. Management then kindly suggests, &ldquo;Go make it happen&rdquo;.   People new to the field soon begin pulling their hair out due to the frustration of continually being told &ldquo;no&rdquo; along with not liking anyone they meet. This leads to the revolving door syndrome of accepting jobs and quitting soon after. However, when you take control of how you will sell, the situation dramatically improves.</p><h3> Strategic Selling <br/>  </h3><p> This is when Strategic Selling comes to the rescue. The theme of Strategic Selling is to learn who all of the key players are that will be involved in the decision-making process. The next step is to ask for input from everyone you meet.  </p><p> However, the critical step is to be certain you will enjoy working with those you meet in order for success to blossom. The company has to be of interest, and the people likeable whether you are a sales representative, entrepreneur, or a job seeker. Otherwise, attempting to work with just any company will only motivate you to quit.</p><h3> Social Selling <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s no secret that social media turned the sales cycle (traditional sales funnel) upside down. Posting content that showcases your thought and how it may help your audience encourages dialogue from interested parties. This shortens the sales cycle because prospective clients approach you. At the same time, you begin to establish a strong brand identity.</p><h3> Relationship Selling <br/>  </h3><p> The crowning glory is when you are able to build relationships with ease at every turn and at every phase of the sales cycle. You are able to tend to extra requests without irritation, and negotiate with a smile. Building a solid footing with everyone you encounter, whether in person or online, produces larger followings and increased sales.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Your Story <br/>  </h3><p> Are you employing a variety of strategies in your effort to increase sales or opportunity for career advancement? Consider the following:</p><li> Experiment with new ways to connect</li><li> Listen to your gut about whether the opportunity is a good match</li><li> Intermix strategies</li><p> By incorporating a variety of ways to find new opportunities, more will arise. Also be mindful of which strategies appear to be working the best. Dedicate the majority of your time to those. You will soon experience a shortened sales cycle for achieving your goals.</p><h3> Sales Tips: <br/>  </h3><li> Remain current on sales strategy</li><li> Read news online for the latest</li><li> Experiment with new ideas for building business</li><li> Intertwine strategies for a robust effort</li><li> Generously share news of interest posted by others</li><li> Begin a conversation with those whose posts are of the most interest</li><li> Explore ways of collaborating to further extend brand identity</li><li> Congratulate others as they are provided recognition</li><li> Be an advisor and a friend to increase sales</li><li> Treat everyone as an equal to establish sound relationships</li><p> These suggestions will help lead you to the Smooth Sale!  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-14 15:11:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-14 15:11:43.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_WAhyKk8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-secret-to-strategic-selling-to-improve-social-selling-results/\", \"post_id\": \"12476\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-14 15:11:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-14 15:11:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-secret-to-strategic-selling-to-improve-social-selling-results\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12477\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6060\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/secret-strategic-selling-improve-social-selling-results.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"732\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468573200,"author_id":161,"chart_url":""}

Distribution is queen. If that wasn&rsquo;t apparent for the last half dozen years, the news this week that behemoth financial media companies signed live-streaming partnerships with social media outlets should make it impossible to ignore.</p><p> CNBC this week formed a partnership to stream content via Facebook Live and Bloomberg TV also recently announced a similar deal with Twitter. Even the mightiest companies and the most well-known brands in their industries have to go where their audience is by matching their distribution with the channels where their audience resides.</p><p> The fact that the media game has changed again isn&rsquo;t really the most significant takeaway here. Remember, the one constant in the world of communication is that news and public relations are constantly changing. The more relevant item here for financial marketers is that financial content providers are finally going where most of their news and information-hungry audience has been camped out the last few years &ndash; the social streams that light up every smart phone and tablet in the world.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Social media is the dominant disseminator of information. Video is the dominant media type. Mobile accessibility is the dominant format. The CNBC and Bloomberg partnerships with Facebook and Twitter, respectively, underscore this reality. Taken together, this move by the financial networks and their social media partners signals that those in the financial services business need to commit resources and staff to their own digital acceleration effort.</p><p> So, here&rsquo;s what you can do now to make sure that your firm is up to speed:</p><li> Shorten your content creation cycle. In a world where receiving content &ldquo;here, now, in my hands&rdquo; is the increasingly common expectation for consumers of information, communicators have to know how to mobilize their messages quickly.</li><li> Show your face. The race for more video options for media outlets, brands and consumers demonstrates what has been known for centuries &ndash; people prefer to see and hear from other people. Getting viewers to connect with your content requires more time hearing directly from the people behind the brand ─ the real thought leaders of the company. The days where it&rsquo;s acceptable to post content under a generic &ldquo;from the company&rdquo; byline are gone.</li><li> Make it OK to experiment. There is no real track record or precedent for financial brands to follow when using social media and live streaming to sell financial products or recruit new customers. It&rsquo;s that new. So unshackle your firm&rsquo;s marketing and try something different.

{"original_id":5820,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Key Principles of “Entitlement De-Programming\" for Millennials","link":"7-key-principles-of-entitlement-de-programming-for-millennials","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I come from the &ldquo;Me Me Me Generation&rdquo;, characterized by wiser elders as being selfish and entitled. We get married later (if at all), have less kids, post a plethora of selfies and do crazy things&mdash;like go backpacking around Europe for two years while working from a laptop&mdash;all in an attempt to satisfy our thirst for purpose or pleasure.</p><p> The data is sobering. According to the National Institutes of Health, the incidence of narcissistic personality disorder is nearly three times as high for individuals in their 20s as for those in their mid-sixties or older. 58% of college students scored higher in narcissism in 2009 than in 1982. There&rsquo;s a bunch of other scary statistics from more young adults living with their parents than ever before to 40% of Millennials feeling they should be promoted in their jobs every two years no matter their level of competency.</p><p> Whether I&rsquo;m at a dinner party or a financial conference, this narcissistic trend is something that inevitably comes up when I talk about passing on values and wisdom to the younger generation. Many shrug and say, &ldquo;Young people are just too entitled.&rdquo; Then they go on to the next topic as if we are supposed to write off a whole generation because they grew up getting too many trophies and wearing t-shirts with PRINCESS printed in sparkly letters across the front.</p><p> Of course, I also run into people who have children or grandchildren who are loving, considerate and grateful. And I&rsquo;ve met some amazingly generous Millennials. What I&rsquo;ve noticed is that the difference between entitled and unentitled kids seems to be mostly about training.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If you ask most people &ndash; even of the Me Me Me Generation &ndash; if they want to help others, they&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; But, often, they don&rsquo;t know how to go about it or it was never something that was a focus in their homes growing up.</p><p> Like any behavior, a focus on self is a habit and one that many employ simply because they don&rsquo;t know any better or because they believe it will make them happier. It is counter intuitive that giving away your time, resources and money to serve someone else could create more joy in your life, but that&rsquo;s exactly what ends up happening.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a program called Mainstreet Philanthropy (mainstreetphilanthropy.org), for example, that focuses on involving middle school and high school students in creating a plan to give to a cause they care about. Over several weeks the students learn how to evaluate philanthropic opportunities and get involved in giving to something they are passionate about. Mainstreet Philanthropy has worked with students in low socioeconomic areas as well as wealthy private schools and the results are always the same: the students begin to take ownership over their giving practices and their focus turns away from themselves towards someone else &ndash; ultimately resulting in greater love, gratitude and compassion.</p><h3> Top 7 Principles of &ldquo;Entitlement De-Programming&rdquo; for Millennials <br/>  </h3><p> There are several principles that make transitioning from a focus on self to a focus on others easier. If you are interested in using philanthropy to prepare your children or the rising generation in becoming more responsible, start with the following guidelines:</p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t Dictate <br/>  </h3><p> One of the best traits of Millennials, which can sometimes be frustrating, is that they don&rsquo;t respond well to authority. So, if you&rsquo;re a parent or mentor and you have a plan you are trying to dictate, it&rsquo;s not going to work. Millennials want to be involved as equals. They want to have their opinions taken seriously and be a part of the process. If they can become co-creators of a giving plan, they will take ownership.</p><h3> 2. Act Like a Role Model <br/>  </h3><p> If you are a parent or someone who is trying to motivate a child or someone else to be more giving, you had better be a good example. What programs do you give to? What are ways you could improve your own philanthropic efforts? It&rsquo;s hard to motivate anyone unless you have their respect.</p><h3> 3. Meaning Matters <br/>  </h3><p> Not everyone is passionate about saving the whales. Some people have a passion for feeding hungry children, while others are passionate about the environment. Talk through the options and determine what lights them up. If nothing stands out, create a research project and begin researching different issues until you come upon something that gets them excited.</p><h3> 4. Create a Philanthropic Mission <br/>  </h3><p> Once a meaningful cause is identified, the next step is to create a personal philanthropic mission statement. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be long or involved, but it should pinpoint the greater vision.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 5. Build a Team <br/>  </h3><p> There is an African proverb that states, &ldquo;If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.&rdquo; Your giving efforts will be much more effective if it is as a team &ndash; a family, a group of friends, a school group, or an existing nonprofit. Look for people with common interests for the causes you care about and form or join a team to address those causes.</p><h3> 6. Give Each Person a Specific Role <br/>  </h3><p> We&rsquo;ve all been involved in those service projects where a bunch of people show up and everyone is told to do something stupid &ndash; like to vaguely help out. I, for instance, once volunteered to help feed the homeless, but so many people showed up that there were five volunteers for every soup ladle and I spent the whole time staring at others ladling soup. If you want to get someone involved at a deeper level, they need to feel like they are making a difference and not just a redundant &ldquo;token&rdquo; who doesn&rsquo;t matter. Emphasize their role and how important it is to the success of the philanthropic mission.</p><h3> 7. Document the Experience <br/>  </h3><p> Encourage them to keep a journal or write about their experiences online. Memories fade quickly and writing it down keeps the passion alive and also serves as an inspiration for others. The more collaborative you can be, the better. Get the team together and have them share their most memorable experiences and what meaning it had for them. Knowing the right questions to ask is a huge help in prompting quality answers. Ask things like, &ldquo;What was the most meaningful thing that happened during the event?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How could we improve our efforts?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What did we do right?&rdquo;</p><h3> The Give Give Give Generation <br/>  </h3><p> With the right tools and resources, &ldquo;narcissistic&rdquo; kids can become unbelievably caring. The younger you can start, the better. When kids see adults giving of their time and talents to others and can personally experience the passion of contributing to something beyond themselves, it seeps into their psyche. And, in time, the focus on self begins to give way to a greater form of satisfaction.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-14 15:27:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-14 15:27:34.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_5LY9xdq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-key-principles-of-entitlement-de-programming-for-millennials/\", \"post_id\": \"12481\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-14 15:27:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-14 15:27:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-key-principles-of-entitlement-de-programming-for-millennials\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12480\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6062\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/7-key-principles-entitlement-de-programming-millennials.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"906\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468573200,"author_id":294,"chart_url":""}

Stanton</p><h3> As a Millennial I grew up focusing on one career choice or two since high school. <br/>  </h3><p> In college, that narrowed down to one field, Psychology &ndash; if I didn&rsquo;t make it big in the music industry after being the lead singer of a college funk band. Now nearly fifteen years and three degrees later, I haven&rsquo;t strayed far from the path I selected in college, but I now perceive the path to be much wider than I had thought. This fall, I will be working in corporate consulting and teaching mindfulness in a Health Sciences department.</p><p> It is critical for our generation to expand the perception of career options that match our skills and interests. In future job climates, we will not merely change careers at major crossroads in our lives, but we will be required to constantly develop new interests and skills in order to remain both viable and engaged in our careers. My father, a Boomer in his sixties, talks about the pressure he had to select one career to span his working life. He selected education and has spent nearly forty-five years in various teaching and administrative positions in education.</p><p> But, our generation will need to be more flexible over the course of our professional lives. The skills I attained in my first few years after college are of little use to me (or anyone else, for that matter) anymore. The life cycles of technology are becoming shorter and shorter. Think of the career span of TV vs. VCR vs. DVR repair. The more specific our skill set, the faster the trip back to the unemployment line.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> But this article is not about despair; it is about hope. Career development needs to be a lifelong commitment that involves aspects of planning, education, and training. And, it all starts with a perspective of the need to work on our careers, even when we are well-trained, well-suited, and well-compensated for our current positions. So many of us started out in career-exploration mode, by performing internships that paid little or nothing but that helped refine our areas of interest. I worked one summer for a Fortune 500 company that went out of business less than ten years later. But the experience was positive in that it forced me to think about how I would choose to utilize my skills and in what environment I could I do that and still be engaged.</p><p> Our society needs to create more educational opportunities between degree programs on one end of the spectrum and vocational training programs on the other. And those opportunities need to be available to a broad spectrum of our society without screening people out on the basis of socioeconomic level or previous education. And, our generation needs to keep stretching our skill platform in order to contribute to the workforce for the remainder of our working days. If the social security forecasters are correct, those days will stretch for five or six decades.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-14 15:34:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-14 15:34:20.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_ml1MT2S.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/career-development-is-a-constant-not-a-change/\", \"post_id\": \"12483\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-14 15:34:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-14 15:34:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"career-development-is-a-constant-not-a-change\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12482\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6063\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/career-development-constant-not-change.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1297\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468591200,"author_id":46,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5822,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Questions to Ask When You're Evaluating Sales Technology","link":"4-questions-to-ask-when-youre-evaluating-sales-technology","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> A fine-tuned sales machine is every sales exec&rsquo;s dream.</h3>Imagine a set of processes&mdash;from prospecting to productivity&mdash;all running seamlessly, reps working efficiently and hitting their quotas, and you not micromanaging every stage of the funnel.Ah&hellip;can&rsquo;t you just feel the freedom?If this is the dream, then what do you need to do to make it happen?The secret ingredient in every fine-tuned sales machine is the set of tools behind it.There are tons of sales tools out there, so in order to choose which ones will drive the most growth, you must understand the intricacies of your company.You must ask digging questions and find every missing link and gap in your funnel.In a <a href=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Sweet Fish Media</a> interview, Fred McGill, VP of Marketing and Business Development for <a href=\"http://redoxengine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Redox</a>, shared how he took a company with zero sales processes and created a high-functioning sales machine from scratch.These were the questions he asked.<h3> What Is the Culture of My Sales Organization?</h3>Based on the culture, what tools will your sales and marketing reps actually adopt and integrate into their workflow?Typically, reps newer to the game are quicker to grab hold of a tool and run with it. On the flip side, more seasoned reps might not be as receptive to new software.  They typically have their particularities, and aren&rsquo;t always gung-ho about change.If you do have resistors in your bunch, it&rsquo;s highly beneficial to have an executive sponsor driving the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind the change.Sometimes it takes a CEO or VP communicating the 50,000-foot goal to employees working on a more granular level.It&rsquo;s also important that you&rsquo;re bringing in technologies that make your reps&rsquo; lives easier. That way, when the resistors see other reps using the tool and being more efficient at their job, they are more likely to get onboard.##TRENDING##<h3> What Integrations Need to Be Considered?</h3>The next question to ask when building a sales machine is, &ldquo;What integrations need to be considered?&rdquo;This deals with understanding and considering your existing IT landscape.If you have a complex IT landscape, it may be more challenging to integrate a sophisticated CRM or marketing tool.In this case, steer towards lightweight tools. Particularly if you don&rsquo;t have an administrator or experienced IT rep.Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be managing the administration of the tool. No one wants that.<h3> What Degree of Administration Is Required?</h3>A well-built sales machine doesn&rsquo;t just shift administrative tasks from your rep&rsquo;s plate to yours.It makes everyone&rsquo;s lives easier and more efficient.As a sales leader, you don&rsquo;t want to be micromanaging the tools that make up your sales process. You want things to be intuitive, which will make your sales team feel empowered in the process.Lean toward the tools that require little to no administration on your end.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> What Is My Budget?</h3>Now, efficiencies are important, but we all know your executives are going to be saying, &ldquo;Show me the money!&rdquo;They might not be screaming it to Cuba Gooding Jr., but you can guarantee they&rsquo;ll be asking for ROI.Before heading into that exec meeting, have answers to these questions about your proposed technologies:<li> Does this tool provide new channels for people to find you?</li><li> Does it provide you a better understanding of trends and how to predict business?</li><li> Does it help you identify and prevent funnel leakage?</li><li> Does it automate aspects of the sales process?</li><li> Will it drive best practices that are common among leading sales organizations?</li><h3> Technologies That Help Map the Buyer Journey</h3>Fred also shared a list of tools that will help you in each stage of the buyer journey:<b> Lead Sourcing and Data Intelligence:</b> In this day and age, your data integrity and governance is so important.

We arrived on time, if not a few minutes early. There were two tables that were available, right in the middle of the restaurant. However, the hostess was looking in other parts of the restaurant. I pointed at one of the open tables and asked if we could sit there. She said, &ldquo;No. That table is for six people.&rdquo; Maybe I can&rsquo;t count, but from what I could tell, the table was set for four in the middle of restaurant that was jammed with tables. There was no way they could put six chairs around it. So, I asked her how she could put six chairs around that table. She thought for a moment and decided to change her story. She said, &ldquo;Actually that table is being held on request for a party coming in with an 8:00 reservation.&rdquo;</p><p> I knew she was making up excuses to not give me that table and wasn&rsquo;t sure why. I could believe that someone requested a specific table, but why would she lie about holding it for six people? I looked at her and asked her, &ldquo;So, which is it? Are you changing it over to a six top or are you holding it for a guest that requested it?&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> She knew she&rsquo;d been caught in a lie, and decided to get her manager. I watched and could see she was explaining to him what happened. This was going to be interesting. I thought, what &ldquo;story&rdquo; was he going to tell me? Was he going to back her up to save face? Was he going to let me sit in one of the open tables? Or, was I going to decide I didn&rsquo;t like being lied to and leave to go to another restaurant?</p><p> Well, the manager was very pleasant. He sat us at one of the open tables, and I thanked him. I shared the story with him and he shook his head in disappointment. He apologized profusely and thanked me for coming to the restaurant.</p><p> There is a big lesson here, and it&rsquo;s very simple: Don&rsquo;t lie to the customer. If you&rsquo;re caught in a lie, it could cost you in a number of ways:</p><li> It&rsquo;s embarrassing.</li><li> You lose credibility and trust with the customer.</li><li> It can give you a bad reputation as an individual.</li><li> It can reflect poorly on your company&rsquo;s reputation.</li><li> Unless you own the company, it could cost you your job.</li><li> And finally, the customer may leave and never come back. <br/>  </li><p> For all of the reasons above, and a few more I&rsquo;m sure, you don&rsquo;t want to lie. A lie will come back to you in only negative ways. Being labeled a liar is not what you want to be known for. You won&rsquo;t find people saying he or she is a good person and a wonderful liar.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-14 15:39:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-14 15:39:36.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_qXsGug5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-lie-to-the-customer-6-ways-it-will-be-costly-if-you-are-caught/\", \"post_id\": \"12487\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-14 15:39:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-14 15:39:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-lie-to-the-customer-6-ways-it-will-be-costly-if-you-are-caught\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12486\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6065\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dont-lie-customer-6-ways-it-will-be-costly-if-you-are-caught.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"738\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468580400,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}

The group will require help with cooking, bathing, grooming, shopping, managing medicines, and toileting.</p><p> Thirty-eight percent of the people surveyed in the 2016 Long-term Care in America report said they will rely on Medicare to pay. Correspondingly, 35% will count on Social Security and personal savings while 32% expects to depend on investments for support.</p><p> Surprisingly, only two out of 10 older adults will use Medicaid to pay for their aging needs although it ranks as the largest public payer fo LTC, according to the Kaiser Commission.</p><p> The misperceptions of long-term care payment options persist among Americans, but their ability to pay increased even though many put off planning for it. How and where individuals want care remains consistent to prior years.</p><h3> Key findings of misperceptions <br/>  </h3><li> Older Americans prefer to receive care at home, and they want that care provided by family. However, family members say it's not their preference due to travel distance and prefer the loved one to live with them.</li><li> Other places for desired care are in a senior community (11 percent), home of a friend or family (4 percent), or a nursing home (4 percent). Men prefer to receive help from a spouse, and women want help from adult children.</li><li> For Americans with an annual income of $50,000 or less, they will likely count on government programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The others who enjoy a higher income expect to rely on personal savings and investments. However, the survey indicates that three in 10 of the upper-income Americans still report reliance on Medicare to help pay for care.</li><li> The general public wants to see more policies to help family caregivers face the price of giving care, with 72 percent supporting state programs for paid family leave at work, 83 percent support tax breaks, and 73 percent support a Social Security earnings credit for family members time out from the workforce</li><li> Four in 10 family members report having missed work to provide long-term care to a loved one.</li><li> Close to one-third report having done no planning for long-term care needs. <br/>  </li><p> On the political front, Democrats and Republicans approve some proposals to help Americans prepare for the costs of long-term care. How it plays out: 80 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of Republicans favor tax breaks to boost aging care savings. Plus, over 70 percent of both parties would approve tax breaks for individuals who buy long-term care insurance.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Equally, both sides favor a portable long-term care insurance model through their employer, similar to COBRA.

I want to take her up on this suggestion because doing so would make her happy. And preserving olives would make me feel like Martha freakin&rsquo; Stewart.</p><p> I really want to take her advice, I really do.</p><p> But I never pick the olives.</p><p> Not to dis my mum &ndash; she is one of the most exquisite human beings I know &ndash; but the olive picking advice irks me like a low-grade toothache.</p><p> Telling people what to do feels good to us, the advice giver. We genuinely believe we are helping them to solve their problem or capitalise on the opportunity that&rsquo;s staring them square in their face.</p><p> Yep. Advice giving is a noble gesture. And if we are the boss, that&rsquo;s our job, right? Well&hellip;not always.</p><p> Giving advice is rarely as useful as listening. </p><p> It&rsquo;s never as powerful as a great question.</p><p> And, usually the advice giving is premature. More often than not, it&rsquo;s delivered before we truly understand the full picture or understand the real challenge for the other person.</p><p> At worst, it can make them feel disempowered, misunderstood or guilty for not acting on our &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo;.</p><p> Telling people what to do is overused in leadership. Sure, the odd timely bit of advice (delivered skillfully and when you sense it&rsquo;s invited or when the other person is truly, truly lost) is a useful tool in your leadership toolkit.</p><p> But here&rsquo;s a bit of advice on giving advice (no, the irony of that statement is not lost on me).</p><p> 1. Before doling out your pearls of wisdom, listen deeply to the other person.</p><p> 2. Check that they actually want or need your input. Often people find it immensely useful to just process their thoughts with an objective sounding board.</p><p> 3. Ask some powerful questions to deepen their insight (and yours) as to what the real challenge is for that person. Hint: its often not the thing that presents itself initially.</p><p> 4. Work with them to widen their options. In their book, Decisive, Chip Heath and Dan Heath compellingly demonstrate through research how choosing between two options produces lower quality results than when we choose from three or more options. Beware the binary.</p><p> 5. Be tentative and don&rsquo;t get attached to them taking your suggested route. So they choose to do something different? Big deal.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Finally, tune into your intuition when delivering advice. Sometimes a mere word or phrase or facial expression might give you a clue as to where to guide the other person.</p><p> Thankfully, there is a happy end to &lsquo;Olivegate&rsquo;.</p><p> This week, when mum suggested I pick the olives for the 1,246,644th time, I thanked her. Then we sat down over a nice cup of tea, and after a cool conversation around why picking the olives was a BIG thing for her &ndash; a heartwarming story involving her, Dad and an olive tree in Yugoslavia in the sixties &ndash; we talked about priorities (mine and hers).</p><p> Together, we decided that SHE would pick the olives with my children instead. It was win-win all round because this way, they could create some awesome Nanny-grandchildren memories and I could smugly channel Annabel Langbein every time guests came for dinner and I flamboyantly whipped open the lid to my HOMEMADE olives &ldquo;that were picked off our own tree&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-14 15:48:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-14 15:48:07.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_Jk9Mukl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-touch-of-advice-on-giving-advice/\", \"post_id\": \"12491\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-14 15:48:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-14 15:48:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-touch-of-advice-on-giving-advice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12490\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6067\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/touch-advice-giving-advice.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"583\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468576800,"author_id":467,"chart_url":""}

Not just in a political sense but for the benefit of your own personal job search.</h3><h3> <br/> Don&rsquo;t make unrealistic claims</h3><p> <br/> Avoid a Nigel Farage situation&hellip; making promises you cannot keep when it comes to crunch time!</p><p> When updating your CV to match the job role you are applying for, avoid adding skills or qualifications you do not have but have placed there to try and get the job. If you get through to the interview stage or receive a job offer the employer will ask for proof of your education achievements. If you do embellish the skills section on your CV, when in reality you cannot do these things. It may result in an awkward conversation with your new boss, trying to explain you have no idea how to do the things they are asking of you! This also applies when stating your job history, be truthful and only state jobs you have had. Remember &ndash; your future boss will ask for references.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t burn bridges </h3><p> <br/> Michael Gove choosing to run for the Conservative party leadership &ndash; burnt his bridges with Boris Johnson claiming he was not capable of uniting the party or country. When ultimately Theresa May landed the job.</p><p> Maintain a good relationship with previous employers, keep it professional. If you are about to resign from your current job don&rsquo;t leave on bad terms, maintain good relationships with co-workers and managers. When handing in your notice, pick the right moment to deliver it to your boss and I would recommend personally telling your colleagues. If you feel you are in a position where there is no advancement or future, express to your boss these feelings. They are more likely to appreciate your honesty rather than suddenly switching jobs with a weak explanation.</p><h3> Knowledge is key</h3><p> <br/> Surprisingly the most Googled term post Brexit was &lsquo;What Is The EU?&rsquo;  </p><p> It is essential you do your research before an interview. Read up on the company, their values and understand the industry as a whole. Most of the information you need will generally be found on the company website. Knowing this information will help you in the interview, when asked the question, &lsquo;why do you want to work for our company?&rsquo; You will be able to provide an answer that proves you have done your research. Gaining knowledge about a potential workplace also will give you an understanding of whether you want to work there and if you agree with their company culture.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Be proactive</h3><p> <br/> After the election it was reported that 36% of young people aged 18-24 voted. If you want your voice heard make sure you vote.</p><p> Instead of dreaming of a new job, proactively seek a new position! It&rsquo;s hard to change something if you don&rsquo;t take action. Spend your evenings and weekends searching for new jobs, signing up to recruitment agencies and updating your CV. Study job descriptions and make sure your CV is suited to what the potential employer is asking. Remember don&rsquo;t be disheartened if the results are not what you wanted and learn from the experience.</p><h3> Long term or short term benefits</h3><p> <br/> Only time will tell how Brexit will affect the economy but for now the process of leaving the EU will take two years.</p><p> When choosing a new job, take a look at how it will benefit your career in the long run. Will the position provide you with new skills and advancement? Or will a short term position be your stepping stone to something bigger? You need to decide whether this is just a job or a career. Sometimes when job searching it&rsquo;s a good thing to take risks, apply for positions with more responsibility than your current job. If you are not qualified enough, accept the rejection but you never know if you don&rsquo;t try.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-14 16:01:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-14 16:01:06.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_67LWWHz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-things-we-can-learn-from-brexit-when-job-hunting/\", \"post_id\": \"12497\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-14 16:01:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-14 16:01:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-things-we-can-learn-from-brexit-when-job-hunting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12496\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6070\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-things-we-can-learn-brexit-when-job-hunting.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"556\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468609200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Dreams of going to the Olympics are coming true or being crushed, with the difference often being mere hundredths of a second.</h3><p> <br/> Last week while speaking in Atlanta to 120 advisors, swimming trials were being held, and many asked me what makes the split-second differences &ndash; is it a particular training exercise, diet, or rest? What separates those who will go on to make history from the other competitors?  <strong>  What&rsquo;s the one thing that matters most? </strong></p><p> In fact, there is no one particular  item  or  activity  that separates the top two finishers (who each earn an Olympic berth) from the rest. However, they do all share the same specific thought process which is crucial for their success.</p><p> Every action, activity, and response is weighed against a very simple question: <strong>  Will this help or hinder? </strong>  They evaluate, <strong>  &ldquo;Will this move me closer to my goal or impede my progress?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> You can use the same thought process in your business.  <strong>  Be like the champion athletes who choose to do only those activities that help them move toward the success they desire. </strong>  This process will lead you to develop conviction for doing everything you need to do correctly and conscientiously. Like the athletes, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to aim for perfection, but do pursue mastery of what you do.</p><p> This mindset eliminates distracting thoughts that can pull you off track, such as, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the best use of my time right now, but if I only do it once, it&rsquo;ll be ok in the grand scheme of things,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;While this won&rsquo;t especially help, it won&rsquo;t really hurt me that much,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Just this one time&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The most successful athletes (and advisors) simply hunt for the best, most effective activities and then pursue them, making them into consistent habits. </strong></p><h3> What activities do you need to begin doing consistently to help move you toward success in your business? <br/>  </h3><li> Is it conscientiously implementing a disciplined follow-up process after each meeting where your meeting notes are entered into your CRM system immediately, instead of leaving it on a loose piece of paper on your desk &ndash; or worse, simply in your mind &ndash; over the next two days?</li><li> Is it planning and calendaring regular client contact activities, so they know when to expect to hear from you and you don&rsquo;t let contact opportunities slip through the cracks?</li><li> Is it finally committing to using model investment portfolios so you&rsquo;re allocation rationale is consistent for all of your clients and not swayed by clients who want you to customize your process for them?</li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> To mimic the behavior of successful people: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Carefully and honestly evaluate current routine actions and habits.  </strong> Is how you regularly use your time and energy moving you closer to or further away from your final objective?</li><li> <strong>  Develop key, core habits necessary to achieve your objective. </strong>  Make a conscious decision to implement three or four helpful, professional actions and resolve to repeat them until they become habits.</li><li> <strong>  Minimize distractions that impede your progress. </strong>  Easier said than done, right? Start by setting realistic boundaries and achievable short term goals. For example, if you live on email and want to reduce the habit, begin by checking it only every 30 minutes. <br/>  </li><p> Keep asking yourself will this help or hinder my progress toward my goal?

Where does your pay plan fall? Are you paying your sales people too much or could it be you are under paying them? Creating a sales pay plan isn&rsquo;t terribly difficult but it&rsquo;s trickier than finding a simple salary range for non-sales positions. I&rsquo;ll answer the two most common questions asked of me regarding sales play plans. &ldquo;How much should I pay my sales people?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How should I structure the pay plan?&rdquo;</p><p> This blog was tough for me to write due to the mathematical elements. My goal in writing is always to help you learn without getting you lost, so hang in there with me; I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it simple and useful. As always if you have any questions, you can post a comment, send me a message or pick up the phone. The first place to start is figuring out what the company goals and budgets are.</p><h3> What are the company profit goals and what&rsquo;s the budget for sales compensation?</h3><p> <br/> Before deciding on a blend of salary and commission to offer, we first determine what the company needs from sales (gross profit after sales), and what can be allocated to sales compensation. Here are the steps:</p><p> <strong>  1.  Gross Profit after sales expense: </strong> Start with the end in mind. What is the needed gross profit after cost of goods (COGS) and sales compensation to fund the business operations and shareholder net profit? In the pie chart example the Gross Profit goal is placed at $1.4 million.</p><p> <strong>  2.  What is your COGS percentage of sales? </strong> In the pie chart example the COGS is 50%. Half of every dollar sold has already been used up in producing or delivering the product.</p><p> <strong>  3.  Budgeted Sales Expense Percentage: </strong> How much will you be allocating to sales compensation (salaries, commissions and bonuses). The pie chart shows 15% as the allocation.</p><p> <strong>  4.  Minimum Sales Revenue Goal: </strong> What is the sales revenue needed to produce the gross profit?  By working backwards with the Gross Profit goal and other percentages, the answer of $4 million is our minimum sales goal to attain the Gross Profit goal of $1.4 million.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"603\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/min-sales-goal.png\" width=\"553\"/></p><h3> How much should you pay your sales people and how much should they sell?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  5.  Fair Market Compensation: </strong> What&rsquo;s fair compensation for a salesperson reaching their sales goal in your market? It&rsquo;s wise to find some benchmark. You can still offer more or less based on your situation, but going into it blindly could be costly. You can check with your peers that have similar sales roles to get a feel for this as well as accessing a salary database (I&rsquo;ve included a few sources) to gain perspective. If you are part of an industry association they usually provide benchmark data for compensation. They also might provide you with average sales by rep. The diagram to the right has our compensation at goal attainment at $90,000.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sales-compensation.png\" width=\"625\"/></p><p> <a href=\"http://www.indeed.com/salary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://www.indeed.com/salary </a></p><p> <a href=\"http://salary.careerbuilder.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://salary.careerbuilder.com </a></p><p> <a href=\"http://www.salary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  www.salary.com </a></p><p> <strong>  6.  Establish a realistic but stretch-worthy individual sales goal. </strong> I usually check around with others in the industry to get a feel for this. As mentioned in the previous point, ask your industry association. Try not to use your own results or the super star you hired a few years ago. Owners and superstars are rare to find so set goals based on above average performers, but not top performers.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> <strong>  7.  How does the sales expense percentage you just created in steps 5 and 6 (9%) compare to the budgeted expense in step 3? </strong> In our example the budget (step 3) calls for 15% and working through steps 5 &amp; 6 resulted in a 9% expense for sales compensation. You now have 6% to use for incentives, apply to marketing or invest in more support to achieve your sales goals.  If your numbers are upside down with the budget percentage smaller, you will need to make adjustments to any of the factors we have discussed to find a place that will attract talent and provide the profit the company needs.</p><p> <strong>  8.  Once you finalize the sales expense percentage to work into your pay plan it&rsquo;s time to work on the structure of the plan. </strong></p><h3> How should you structure the pay plan?</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ll use the 9% for sale expense and $1,000,000 as the sales goal. This is a great situation to be in as you have a cushion to deal with shortfalls if they happen. Let&rsquo;s look at how to decide on a salary, commission or a blend.</p><h3> <strong>  Commission only with a draw </strong></h3><p> <br/> Commission only is easy to figure, it&rsquo;s 9%. You might need to provide a draw to help people get started and to provide stability through the ups and downs of sales.</p><p> A draw is simply an advance on future commissions. When commissions are earned, any draws are subtracted from the commissions before a check is cut to the sales rep. I prefer offering salary plus commission as it provides the company greater return on over achievement and demonstrates your commitment to the sales person. In most cases with a draw, if a sales person does not perform, the company rarely recovers the draw, so in essence it&rsquo;s a salary.</p><h3> <strong>  Salary plus commission </strong></h3><p> <br/> Salary plus commission is a little more complicated to build and the company does assume more risk. As with most investments, if you take a little more risk and monitor and measure your investment you can realize a greater return. It&rsquo;s only risky of you don&rsquo;t pay attention. Commission percentages are higher on draws and lower on salary compensations. When a sales person is selling at or over goal, the company is realizing a greater margin per sale with a salary program. The last diagram illustrates this.</p><h3> <strong>  Salary Percentage Considerations </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> <i>  A lower salary or draw should be considered in the following situations: </i></p><li> When sales goals can be achieved monthly due to the consistent number of opportunities in the market place available to sell. Security systems, office equipment or advertising are examples that would fit into this category. The more transactional and less complicated, the lower the salary can be.</li><p> A medium salary or draw should be considered in the following situations:</p><li> When sales consistency happens more quarterly and monthly goals tend to be less consistent. Deal size varies more as well as sales cycle. Larger telephone or computer systems, mid-size commercial insurance or custom manufacturing can fall into this category.</li><p> <i>  A higher salary or draw should be considered if these situations exist. </i></p><li> High-ticket sales with fewer sales opportunities and a long sales cycle.</li><li> You have a proven performer and they prefer and perform better with a salary plus commission in any situation.</li><h3> <b>  Commission Percentage with Salary </b></h3><p> <br/> The chart illustrates your percentage splits in the pay planning stage. As mentioned before you forecast for 100% goal attainment. In each split when the sales rep hits $1,000,000 in sales they earn $90,000 based on the mix or blend or pay elements. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/compensation-split.png\" width=\"992\"/></p><h3> <b>  Bonus </b></h3><p> <br/> Bonuses can be used for hitting certain milestone, selling specific products, maintaining list price or whatever makes sense for your business. Bonuses should be a moving target that allows you to put emphasis on areas of the business you want to improve.  You allocate a percentage of earning potential and then announce the bonus opportunities as needed.</p><p> Commission percentage In the three examples the commission percentage is different. The high salary range pays a commission rate of 1.5%. The medium salary pays 4% and the low salary pays at 6%. What happens when a sales person in each range over achieves and sells $1.5 million?</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"561\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sales-earnings.png\" width=\"1026\"/></p><p> Now you can see how the risk reward works. The salesman takes on the risk at the straight commission or low salary and earns more when he performs. When the company takes on more risk with a higher salary, the company realizes more gross profit during higher performance. When companies reinvest this additional margin in marketing, service or sales incentives, a momentum can occur that results in consistently meeting and exceeding your goals. Sales people are willing to earn less if they have a great product and service to sell and a company that provides a great place to work.</p><p> There you go, easy as pie. One last thought.

Advisors frequently ask me if I had to choose the most powerful, researched-based, proven psychological strategy to build resilience to stress, what would it be?  Here&rsquo;s the answer:</p><h3> Maintain Optimistic Expectations, Despite Every Setback and Challenge You Face in Your Advisory Role</h3><p> <br/> This sounds simplistic, but the psychological definitions of optimistic and pessimistic expectations are not as simple as looking at the glass half empty or half full.</p><p> Burgeoning research by Dr. Martin Seligman (\"Learned Optimism\"), involved hundreds of studies where financial professionals were assessed as to whether they were hard-wired through their DNA and life experiences to interpret negative events and setbacks in their lives with optimistic or pessimistic attributions and expectations.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Those who dealt with the setbacks with an optimistic expectation were significantly more successful and less stressed than their pessimistic counterparts and their washout rates were half those with the pessimistic orientations. </p><p> This concept is so powerful, that Dr. Seligman and his associates have even shown strong relationships between optimistic expectation and eradication of diseases and life extension!</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> The Good News&hellip;Every Advisor Can Learn to Overcome Their DNA and Life Experience Hardwiring to Become an Optimistically Oriented Person!</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  How Pessimistic People View Setbacks </strong></h3><p> <br/> When bad things happen, pessimistically hard wired people tell themselves such things as, \"It's my fault, it's a permanent flaw of mine, it's always going to be this way, probably for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p><p> They look at the unfortunate outcome or setback as having an <strong>  internal cause </strong> , being <strong>  permanent </strong> and <strong>  pervasive </strong> , indicative of their overall incompetence.</p><p> I refer to this kind of self-talk as <strong>  &ldquo;linguistic toxicity.&rdquo;  </strong> It leads to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, adding not only stress, but often depression to the advisor&rsquo;s moods.</p><h3> <strong>  How Pessimistic People View Good Outcomes </strong></h3><p> <br/> You would think that when good things happen (e.g., market rallies) that even pessimistically hard wired advisors would feel relief and calm.  Wrong! When good things happen to pessimistically hard wired people, they typically view them as <strong>  Externally Caused </strong> (&ldquo;It was a fluke, or luck.&rdquo; ), <strong>  Temporary </strong> (&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;) and <strong>  Exclusive </strong></p><p> (&ldquo;I was lucky with the recommendations I made to my clients and how nicely they have done in this market, but l still don&rsquo;t view myself as a competent financial advisor.&rdquo;)</p><h3> <strong>  How Optimistic People View Setbacks </strong></h3><p> <br/> People who are hard wired or learn to give themselves optimistic explanations for setbacks that take place in their lives view them as follows:  <strong>  Externally Caused </strong> ( &ldquo;This was a fluke.  No one predicted that the market would be so volatile this week. It&rsquo;s an aberration and I can&rsquo;t take responsibility for this drop in the value of my clients&rsquo; portfolios.&rdquo; <strong>  Temporary </strong> ( &ldquo;It is highly unlikely that these market conditions will last.&rdquo;) <strong>  Exclusivity </strong> (&ldquo; I had difficulty dealing with a few of my aggressive clients, but I allayed the fears of the bulk of my clients and they love the work I do for their wealth management.&rdquo;)</p><p> I refer to this type of self-talk as <strong>  &ldquo;linguistic nutrition.&rdquo; </strong> These optimistically oriented advisors go with the flow and keep their outlook very positive, regardless of the obstacles and challenges they face. </p><h3> <strong>  How Optimistic People View Good Outcomes </strong></h3><p> <br/> Optimistically oriented people expect good outcomes to occur frequently. <strong>  Internal Cause </strong> (&ldquo; It&rsquo;s my skills, work ethic and motivation that makes me the very best advisor my clients could ever work with .&rdquo;) <strong>  Permanent </strong> (&ldquo; I certainly expect good things to continually happen to me and my clients, despite the challenges that go with the territory.&rdquo;)  <strong>  Pervasive </strong> (&ldquo; This is just one example in my life where I have the skills and talent to be successful.&rdquo;</p><p> Obviously, it is extremely important for people who are not hard wired to be attributing unfortunate outcomes optimistically to learn how to remove their pessimistic thinking habits and change them to optimistic ones.</p><p> Wondering how to make the shift from pessimism to optimism, consistently?

He was so convinced of the value of his product that after our initial pleasantries, he praised its attributes for several minutes. I asked one question and he talked on for several more minutes. His mistake was that he didn&rsquo;t stop talking long enough to find out why I might need his product or how it could best serve me. He lost the deal because he knew how to talk about what he was selling but he didn&rsquo;t know how to listen to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does this relate to serving clients experiencing loss or transition? Like the worst salespeople, the least supportive advisors are those that don&rsquo;t know how to ask good questions and listen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is often a chorus of objections at this point. Usually they sound like these:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I am a financial professional, not a psychologist. I&rsquo;m not going to ask my clients about their grief.</li>\r\n\t<li>I don&rsquo;t want to make my clients cry in my office.

If you carefully avoid the topic and do not bring your client&rsquo;s grief into the room, there is a big white elephant sitting on the table between you. You both know it&rsquo;s there but you are trying to ignore it, look over it, slide it to the side, or otherwise pretend it&rsquo;s not there. It adds a level of tension as you participate in the game of mutual deception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This feels very familiar to grieving clients, because they encounter it everywhere. Most people, from family to casual acquaintances, don&rsquo;t know what to say so they say nothing at all. They talk about anything and everything except the person who died. They try to cheer grievers up, hoping to make them feel better. The bereaved people, not wanting to make others uncomfortable, go along with it, but it feels inauthentic and they walk away alone, isolated, and unsupported. Is that how you want your clients to leave your office?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minute you acknowledge the truth, the big white elephant disappears. For instance, you can ask something simple such as: &ldquo;What do you wish people knew about what it&rsquo;s like for you now, a month after Paul died?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What has surprised you about the experience of going through Paul&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; When you ask an invitational, open-ended question like these, the big white elephant disappears and the tension evaporates. They know you care enough to ask, whether or not they choose to accept your invitation and talk about it. They know you aren&rsquo;t avoiding the topic or hiding behind your spreadsheets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, if they do choose to tell the story and you listen with care, you offer them support they aren&rsquo;t getting from others. You genuinely help and comfort them, and at the same time you distinguish yourself in the field. You build a level of trust and loyalty you can&rsquo;t get anywhere else. It&rsquo;s good for your clients, and it just happens to also be good for business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The bottom line: You have a lot to lose if you don&rsquo;t ask; you have nothing to lose if you do</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advisorpedia.com/viewpoints/how-to-recognize-mixed-emotions-in-clients-life-changes\">How to Recognize Mixed Emotions in Clients&#39; Life Changes</a></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-16 13:23:41.000000","last_updated":"2024-05-29 22:52:31.481093","image_url":"2016/7/banishing-the-big-white-elephant-when-a-client-is-grieving.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":"","white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"<p>Like the worst salespeople, the least supportive advisors are those that don&rsquo;t know how to ask good questions and listen.</p>","placefilter":2,"rss_include":0,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/banishing-the-big-white-elephant-when-a-client-is-grieving/\", \"post_id\": \"12511\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-16 13:23:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-16 13:23:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"banishing-the-big-white-elephant-when-a-client-is-grieving\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12510\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6075\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/banishing-big-white-elephant-when-client-grieving.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"856\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":23021,"author_id":24,"chart_url":""}

To many successful advisors, the most important business skill is not project management or multitasking, but empathy.</h3><p> <br/> Empathy,  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238935\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  defined by entrepreneur </a>  Joey Pomerenke as &ldquo;the feeling that you understand and share another person&rsquo;s experiences and emotions; and the ability to share someone else&rsquo;s feelings,&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always the first thing people think about when they consider business skills. But it is increasingly making it to the  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/corporate-empathy-is-not-an-oxymoron\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  top of the lists of &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; </a>  that managers and leaders need.</p><p> &ldquo;Empathy should be embedded into the entire organization,&rdquo; writes Belinda Parmar in the  Harvard Business Review . &ldquo;There is nothing soft about it. It is a hard skill that should be required from the board-room to the shop floor.&rdquo;</p><p> For Akio Morita of Sony and Steve Jobs, developing empathy and observing how customers use products and services, and listening to them talk about the products and services they need, helps make developing product ideas easier.  &ldquo;Both Akio Morita and Steve Jobs were famous for never commissioning market research,&rdquo; writes James Allworth in  Harvard Business Review , who calls empathy the  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/05/empathy-the-most-valuable-thing-they-t\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  most important thing he learned at Harvard Business School </a> . &ldquo;Instead, they&rsquo;d just walk around the world watching what people did. They&rsquo;d put themselves in the shoes of their customers.&rdquo;</p><h3> Companies that don&rsquo;t look at things from the perspective of their customers and competitors risk being disrupted right out of their industries, like Netflix did to Blockbuster, warns Allworth.</h3><p> <br/> In fact, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, famous for his work on  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/processing-disruption-disruption/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  innovation and disruption </a> , says it&rsquo;s important to  <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/clay-christensens-milkshake-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  figure out the &ldquo;job&rdquo; </a>  that people are &ldquo;hiring&rdquo; a product to do&mdash;and that job may be very different from the product&rsquo;s function. &ldquo;FedEx, for example, fulfills the job of getting a package from here to there as fast as possible,&rdquo; writes Carmen Nobel in the Harvard Business School blog  Working Knowledge . &ldquo;Disney does the job of providing warm, safe, fantasy vacations for families. OnStar provides peace of mind.&rdquo;</p><p> However, for many advisors, understanding how their clients think and having empathy are not common practices. Perhaps this is a core reason why more than 70% of widows switch advisors once their husbands have passed away. Dan Richards concurs in his article on <a href=\"http://www.investmentexecutive.com/-/are-female-advisors-the-future-of-financial-advice-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the future of women advisors </a> that while the traditional results-driven approach to client communication is important, moving forward in a drastically different business world, &ldquo;listening, empathizing and developing deep bonds will be pivotal not only in attracting and retaining clients but also in getting clients to stick to their plans.&rdquo;</p><p> Inside the company, empathy helps with management and collaboration by helping to understand the other person&rsquo;s perspective. Putting yourself in someone else&rsquo;s shoes can make it easier to find a compromise between two points of view. Similarly, thinking about how other people might like to be treated at work can make them more productive.</p><p> &ldquo;Many businesses use punishment and negative consequences so employees behave in a particular way,&rdquo; Pomerenke writes. &ldquo;Showing appreciation through benefits, coaching and development, incentives and genuine rewards sends the message that the business simply cares about the people connected to it.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> So how do you develop empathy, or increase the amount you already have? Here&rsquo;s some suggestions from Martinuzzi&rsquo;s book,   <a href=\"http://www.clarionenterprises.com/books-mensch.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Leader as a Mensch: Become the Kind of Person Others Want to Follow </a> :</p><li> <strong>  Listen to people </strong> &mdash;not just their words but also their facial expressions and body language&mdash;without interrupting. And while you&rsquo;re listening, pay attention&mdash;don&rsquo;t use your phone or look at your watch.</li><li> <strong>  Talk to people </strong> &mdash;ask them about their interests, pay attention to what they&rsquo;re doing and praise them for what they&rsquo;re doing well, and encourage them to speak up with their own ideas. <br/>  </li><p> In addition to the above, it&rsquo;s also been found that  <a href=\"http://geekandsundry.com/role-playing-gamers-have-more-empathy-than-non-gamers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  people who participate in role-playing games </a>  are more empathic. So it might be good to encourage a company game night!</p><p> You might say, well, that&rsquo;s fine for small companies that can afford to do all that handholding, but I work for a big organization and we don&rsquo;t have time for all that touchy-feely stuff. But that&rsquo;s not true, writes Parmar, who has researched which companies are the most and least empathic. &ldquo;There is absolutely no evidence that being big automatically makes you un-empathic,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;Empathy is most definitely not a problem of scale, but more an indication of management priorities.&rdquo;</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-16 14:36:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-16 14:36:40.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_U8Y29jC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-empathy-is-the-most-important-business-skill/\", \"post_id\": \"12513\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-16 14:36:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-16 14:36:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-empathy-is-the-most-important-business-skill\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12512\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6076\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-empathy-most-important-business-skill.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1710\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468839600,"author_id":480,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5834,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Your Client a Modern-Day Sisyphus? Three Ways to End the Vicious Cycle","link":"is-your-client-a-modern-day-sisyphus-three-ways-to-end-the-vicious-cycle","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> In Greek mythology, the gods punished King Sisyphus for bad behavior by forcing him to push a giant boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down again &mdash; over and over for all of eternity. Up and down, up and down in an endless cycle of effort and despair. Sound familiar?</h3><p> <br/> Following last month&rsquo;s Brexit decision, the Dow plunged 611 points (over 3.4% in one day) and the S&amp;P lost 3.6% in a single day. The S&amp;P then quickly recovered and hit all-time highs. 1  Investors who don&rsquo;t keep their emotions in check can most likely relate to Sisyphus, putting enormous energy into deciding when to enter the markets (usually around a high), only to see their account balances fall back down again. And so begins another trip.</p><p> Managing clients&rsquo; emotions is challenging and frustrating, yet it can be extremely rewarding when executed well. Here are three ways you can help a client get a handle on their reactions to the ups and downs of the markets and avoid feeling like a modern day Sisyphus.</p><h3> Embrace Emotions</h3><p> <br/> A CEG Worldwide study shows that &ldquo;84% of affluent clients want to connect with you emotionally first &mdash; and then use logic to justify their desire to engage with you. This means who you are and what drives you as a person has a big impact on whether affluent investors will want to work with you.&rdquo; 2  So rather than leading your initial meetings with facts and figures and logic, it&rsquo;s important to drive home why you want to help clients in the first place and, specifically, how you are qualified to do so. Crafting a personal story about why you are so passionate about helping clients can help investors better understand the value you deliver.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve built a strong connection and established trust with a client, they are more likely to rely upon you to navigate their financial journey &mdash; even when the waters are choppy. In other words, once the trust is there, you&rsquo;re more likely to be able to coach clients off the ledge in times of financial stress and keep them focused on what really matters, their personal goals and objectives.</p><h3> Use the &ldquo;IKEA Effect&rdquo; to Help Clients Remain Committed</h3><p> <br/> The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias in which consumers place a higher value on products they have partially created. According to Behavioral Economics, &ldquo;The IKEA effect is particularly relevant today, given the shift from mass production to increasing customization and co-production of value. The effect has a range of possible explanations, such as positive feelings (including feelings of competence) that come with the successful completion of a task, a focus on the product&rsquo;s positive attributes, and the relationship between effort and liking.&rdquo; 3</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how you can use this cognitive bias to your clients&rsquo; advantage. Instead of having a client fill out a traditional risk tolerance questionnaire that will &ldquo;assign&rdquo; them a standard, off-the-shelf balanced portfolio, collaborating with them to build a personalized asset allocation together may help clients remain far more committed to achieving their long-term goals. Part of the reason is that they were actively involved in the process. For more on the benefits of a collaborative portfolio construction process, click here.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Incorporate &ldquo;Safety Wheels&rdquo; Where Needed</h3><p> <br/> Just as the markets go up and down, investors&rsquo; appetite for risk goes up and down. Changes in investor behavior are documented by money flows into equities during the late stages of a bull market and out of equities during the late stages of a bear market. In both cases, irrational behavior is driven by fear and greed.</p><p> A personalized risk management approach will adjust and adapt to the changing markets based upon the desired outcome or goal of the client. Here are a few suggestions for using personalized risk management to help clients remain on track:</p><li> Use personal benchmarks to help clients stay focused on their needs not just market results. Tie the benchmarks to specific goals the client wishes to fund, such as college for a child or leaving a legacy.</li><li> Use a segmented bucket strategy to help clients&rsquo; segment risk over time. Money that needs to be tapped in the short term should be placed in risk-free asset classes such as cash. Longer term money (needed 15-20 years out) can be placed in higher risk securities such as equities that would have the potential to recover from a market downturn.</li><li> When appropriate, incorporate downside hedging in an effort to protect clients&rsquo; downside risk exposure. <br/>  </li><p> By managing client emotions and providing them with simple tools to stay on track, you can add tremendous value to your relationships and your practice. Help clients avoid the unnecessary cycle of stress and anxiety by channeling their attention toward what truly matters to them.</p>1. <a href=\"http://cnbc.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> CNBC.com</a>2. <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/news/strategies-that-draw-the-affluent\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.financial-planning.com/news/strategies-that-draw-the-affluent</a>3. <a href=\"https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/ikea-effect\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/ikea-effect</a>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-16 14:42:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-16 14:42:27.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_HlKd7Tr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-your-client-a-modern-day-sisyphus-three-ways-to-end-the-vicious-cycle/\", \"post_id\": \"12515\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-16 14:42:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-16 14:42:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-your-client-a-modern-day-sisyphus-three-ways-to-end-the-vicious-cycle\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12514\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6077\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/your-client-modern-day-sisyphus-three-ways-end-vicious-cycle.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"958\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468836000,"author_id":376,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5835,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Makings of a Productive To-Do List","link":"the-makings-of-a-productive-to-do-list","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There are two kinds of people &ndash; ones that make lists and those that don&rsquo;t (we&rsquo;ve all heard that saying before, right?)! And I&rsquo;m definitely a list-person.</h3><p> <br/> As a self-proclaimed list-maker, I think the benefits of creating a To-Do list outweigh the costs.  I may be biased here but the only negative I can think of is&hellip;the time it may take to jot down your list (but if you&rsquo;re disciplined about the task, it becomes part of your routine).  The advantages, on the other hand, are well worth the time and effort you put into it.  Items on your To-Do list are goals &ndash; so by simply writing them out, you&rsquo;re able to easily prioritize, manage your time, set expectations, and hold yourself accountable.  I&rsquo;m all about setting targets and crossing them off once completed (that feeling of scratching an item off the list is so freeing!).  There&rsquo;s a bit of physiology in play when you create To-Do lists; it makes you more focused, productive, and helps reduce stress because you&rsquo;re in control.</p><p> I recommend having 2 To-Do lists: a daily one and a life-long one.  Most people make variations of daily To-Dos, whether it is for work or it&rsquo;s just a grocery list.  Items on this list are usually small &ldquo;must-do-by-today&rdquo; tasks. However, very few people have built out a life-long To-Do list.  This list is home to bolder but realistic goals.  You&rsquo;re allowed to be flexible, but don&rsquo;t make it your &lsquo;bucket list&rsquo; either. </p><p> Here are the types of goals you should have in your life-long To-Do list:</p><p> <strong>  1. A few very easily attainable goals &ndash; </strong> these are activities that you can start and end within 1-6 months.  The purpose of having these goals on the list is to quickly achieve them, cross them off, and boost confidence to tackle the rest of the list. (ex. Learn how to swim, volunteer at the local hospital, read a book). </p><p> <strong>  2. A Career goal &ndash; </strong> be realistic here and start to jot down detailed descriptions of what you want to accomplish.  You should have multiple goals with staggered timeframes that lead you to your dream career or contribution.  (ex. write long-form content once a month for 6 months, become a contributing writer for a well-known online media company, introduce myself to 1 new person in the industry every week)</p><p> <strong>  3. A Relationship goal &ndash; </strong> you may feel guilty for adding &lsquo;family time&rsquo; on your To-Do list, but let&rsquo;s face it, we&rsquo;re all so very busy that we keep pushing back that brunch!  Maintaining relationships is essential so think about who is most important to you &ndash; family, spouse, college friends, past colleagues &ndash; and set up goals to meet with them. (family cruse once a year, weekend getaway with the hubby at least twice a year, host a NYE party)</p><p> <strong>  4. A Health goal &ndash; </strong> whether you&rsquo;re already fit or are trying to lose a few pounds, a healthy lifestyle is a must, so write out structured goals to help you take doable steps towards your ideal target.  This is similar to career goals, where you have to take yourself on a journey and hit milestones before you leap. (10K steps a day, 5K charity run, eat homemade meals during weekdays)</p><p> <strong>  5. A Passion Project goal &ndash; </strong> be completely selfish on this one.  Find something you have always wanted to do but had far too many excuses not to do it.  These goals may sit on your list for a while but just seeing them on paper will motivate you to act. (ex. write a children&rsquo;s book, backpack around Europe, run the NYC marathon, film a documentary)</p><p> <strong>  6. A Financial goal &ndash; </strong> &ldquo;money doesn&rsquo;t buy you happiness but&hellip;wait doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  Odds are that in order to accomplish most of your other goals, you&rsquo;ll be digging deep into your pockets.  Activities that proactively help you manage your finances, increase your income, decrease your expenses, become well versed in financial lingo is the focus here.  Although &ldquo;buying a home&rdquo; or &ldquo;paying off student debt&rdquo; may be your ultimate goal, put more effort into researching current money habits and then documenting better routines. (buy coffee 2x/week instead of 5x/week = savings of ~$430/year, increase 401K contribution to 8% for at least 10 years, set up weekly automated transfers of $200 into savings account)</p><p> Once you have created your life-long To-Do list, you should revisit it every 6 months.  With each revisit, the aim is to cross something off <strong>  AND </strong> add to or edit the list.  If you&rsquo;re seeing that you&rsquo;re not getting traction on any of your goals, especially the &lsquo;easily attainable&rsquo; ones, than it&rsquo;s time to further drill down your To-Dos (get granular).

We just know that there are a lot of them, they seem to have disposable income, and we&rsquo;d really like them to spend some of that income at our businesses. It&rsquo;s just too bad that we don&rsquo;t have any data or historical insight that might help us better understand the strange new creatures living among us.</p><p> If that sounds ridiculous, it should. Marketing will always evolve with the trends and technology of the times, but the core qualities of good business appeal to customers regardless of their generation (or their planet of origin). So lighten up&hellip; <a href=\"http://tedrub.in/1O91grl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Millennials are not that scary! </a></p><h3> They&rsquo;re human, like you and me</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no doubt that Millennials, as a group tend to rely on  <a href=\"http://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2015/12/09/millennials-digital-video-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  social channels </a> , research, reviews and each other when making a purchasing decision. The thing is, so does  <a href=\"http://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2016/05/24/you-had-me-at-hello/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  everyone else who owns a smartphone </a>  and has friends. How you connect matters, but it&rsquo;s really just an introduction. The most important thing is how you treat them  after  you&rsquo;ve made the initial connection. You&rsquo;ve heard these tips before, but they bear mentioning again:</p><li> <strong>  Be responsive. Please! </strong>  You can produce great content and share it in all the right places, but it won&rsquo;t make an impact if you&rsquo;re not there to continue the conversation. Answer questions, respond thoughtfully to criticism, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to have a little fun when the opportunity arises.</li><li> <strong>  Encourage conversation, rather than waiting for it to come to you. </strong>  There are plenty of people sharing content on your favorite social channels, just like you. Some of it is really great! Find it, read it and join the conversation.</li><li> <strong>  Be human.  </strong> Automated messages and cookie-cutter responses often come off as insulting to the recipient&mdash;no matter their age. Why should they take the time to learn about your business, if you won&rsquo;t take the time to learn something about them?</li><li> <strong>  When in doubt,  </strong> <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/bringing-justbenice-to-the-workplace/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <strong>   #JustBeNice  </strong> </a> <strong>  . </strong>  Mistakes last forever online, but so do positive moments. Handle a difficult customer with grace in a public online space, and you don&rsquo;t just get a chance to win over the customer in question&hellip; you make a positive impression on anyone who encounters that conversation in the future. <br/>  </li><h3> The World Needs Less Convincing, and More Conversing</h3><p> <br/> In my opinion, I think we&rsquo;re still too steeped in the old &ldquo;convince and convert&rdquo; mentality&mdash;even though the social world around us is swirling in conversation. People hate to be sold&mdash;yet we&rsquo;re still selling them. Visit your favorite widely read blog, and scroll to the bottom of a post, past the comments section. No matter the quality and prestige of the blog, you&rsquo;re nearly guaranteed to see some of this &ldquo;convincing&rdquo; advertising. These ads aim to convince you that someone has found &ldquo;the one trick that insurance companies hate,&rdquo; or that &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t BELIEVE the brilliant idea this guy found to pay off his mortgage in three weeks.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> I might be missing out on a lot of great secrets by never, ever clicking those links, but I&rsquo;ll go out on a limb and say that most people are tired of being convinced&hellip; no matter their generation. If they want to see what others think of your business, they can check the reviews or social chatter. If they&rsquo;re interested enough to engage you directly, that&rsquo;s not an opportunity you want to squander. By all means, continue the conversation, but tap the brakes on the sales pitch. You have far more to gain in the long run by being responsive and conversing human to human.</p><p> So if anyone tries to tell you that they have the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of marketing to millennials, just smile, nod and remember they are just people, nothing genetically different, it&rsquo;s the environment that is different, and it is affecting us all.</p><p> This originally appeard on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ted Rubin </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-16 21:09:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-16 21:09:17.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_p2TYTGE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/busting-the-myth-of-marketing-to-millennials/\", \"post_id\": \"12519\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-16 21:09:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-16 21:09:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"busting-the-myth-of-marketing-to-millennials\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12518\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6079\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/busting-myth-marketing-millennials.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"610\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468864800,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5837,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Did You Hear What Your Prospect or Client Is Saying or Just What You Wanted to Hear?","link":"did-you-hear-what-your-prospect-or-client-is-saying-or-just-what-you-wanted-to-hear","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Last week, in Top Characteristic <a href=\"/grow/sales-strategy/do-you-have-these-characteristics-of-a-top-sales-producer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Number Two </a> , I introduced the concept of scripting out the very best responses to the selling situations and objections you get into 80 to 90% of the time. I urged you to practice, drill and rehearse these responses until they become automatic.</p><h3> The point here is that you are practicing the right responses.</h3>You see, the thing about practice is that it doesn&rsquo;t make perfect, as everyone has heard. Practice only makes permanent. And that&rsquo;s why underperforming sales reps and sales team remain stuck in unsatisfactory results. They keep doing and saying the wrong things over and over again.The truth is this: Only practice of perfection makes perfect.That&rsquo;s why Characteristic Number Two is so important. Only by practicing the right responses will you achieve perfection in sales. And this leads us to Number Three:<strong> Top Characteristic Number Three:</strong> Record and critique your calls every day.A top telemarketing sales trainer, Stan Billue, first introduced me to this concept. He said that nothing could help you double your income in 90 days faster than recording and critiquing your calls daily.He also said that most sales reps would not be willing to do this (and he&rsquo;s right). But, he said, if you are willing to do it, then you will quickly move into the Top 20% of the selling professionals in your company and industry (he was right there, too!).By the way, all professionals record their performances and then use them to improve. Think about how much time football players spend watching game film, or dancers spend watching film of their practices and performances, or actors and directors watching a previous day&rsquo;s shoot, etc.Every professional records, critiques and gets better by analyzing and improving their performance using some kind of recording device. You need to as well.<h3> Once I made a commitment to recording my calls, I was quickly amazed by how much I was missing, and I think you will be, too. Here are some things to be on the look-out for:</h3><strong> 1) How well did you listen to your prospect or client?</strong>This is huge because once you begin hearing yourself on a sales call, you&rsquo;ll be amazed by how much and how quickly you start talking. Often talking over your prospect.<strong> 2) Did you hear what your prospect or client was saying or did you just hear what you wanted to hear?</strong>Clients and prospects are always trying to tell us what&rsquo;s important to them, but most of the time we never hear it. When you begin listening to your calls, you&rsquo;ll see the need to begin using your Mute Button so you hear the buying signals &ndash; and the potential objections.<strong> 3) Did you ask all the right qualifying questions?</strong>Most sales don&rsquo;t close because prospects just aren&rsquo;t qualified to begin with. By listening to what questions you are missing, you&rsquo;ll be able to strengthen your calls on the front end, thereby producing more qualified leads to close later on.<strong> 4) Did you follow your best practice script, or did you fall back on your old habits of ad-libbing.</strong>Following a new script is hard! Our tendency is to fall back on our old scripts and start shooting from the hip. By recording yourself, you&rsquo;ll begin to hold yourself accountable.<strong> 5) When answering an objection, did you end by asking for the order or did you simply talk past the close?</strong>This is a big one as well because many sales reps are afraid of asking for the order for fear of getting more objections. But asking for the deal is crucial and must be done over and over again.##TRENDING##<strong> 6) Did you introduce an objection by talking too much?</strong>This will give you shivers the first time you hear yourself doing it.<strong> 7) How about tie downs and trial closes?</strong>Most sales reps love to talk. It&rsquo;s a bad habit because in inside sales, you have no idea what your prospect is thinking &ndash; unless you stop to ask them. By recording yourself, you&rsquo;ll get an idea of how much you&rsquo;re talking, and how much you&rsquo;re listening.<strong> 8) Are you improving?</strong>This is big because we all need reinforcement. You need to hear yourself getting better, celebrate your improvement and see the benefits of all the work you&rsquo;re doing to get better. By recording yourself, you&rsquo;ll be able to do just that.<strong> 9) How is your tone, your pacing and your energy?</strong>All of these things are crucial on a call, and if you&rsquo;re not objectively listening to yourself, you have no way of correcting yourself.<strong> 10) You&rsquo;ll find many other ways to improve as well &ndash; ways that would never occur to the other 80%.</strong>As you begin listening to yourself, you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s painful in the beginning. Nobody likes to hear the sound of their own voice, and no one likes to hear how bad they usually are. But soon you&rsquo;ll be happy you did, because nothing pays off faster than practicing this crucial characteristic.The easiest way to start is to pick a partner at work and begin listening to each other&rsquo;s calls during lunch. Get a buddy and make a commitment to tearing each other apart (all in fun!), but be ruthless in your effort to get better. What you&rsquo;ll find is that when you&rsquo;re back on the phone, just before you go off script or talk over someone, you&rsquo;ll see your buddy&rsquo;s face and you&rsquo;ll hit Mute to avoid making a mistake that your buddy will point out later&hellip;As soon as you can, find a way to record and download your recordings for playback and critique. The sooner you do, the sooner you&rsquo;ll leapfrog over your competition!","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-16 21:16:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-16 21:16:38.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_OlTUBDc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/did-you-hear-what-your-prospect-or-client-is-saying-or-just-what-you-wanted-to-hear/\", \"post_id\": \"12521\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-16 21:16:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-16 21:16:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"did-you-hear-what-your-prospect-or-client-is-saying-or-just-what-you-wanted-to-hear\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12520\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6080\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/did-you-hear-what-your-prospect-or-client-saying-or-just-what-you-wanted-hear.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"886\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468832400,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5838,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Future of Advisors: Who Will Be the Winners?","link":"the-future-of-advisors-who-will-be-the-winners","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The advisory industry has been evolving and two trends are clear: The future is fee-based&mdash;and advisers are tech-obsessed.</h3><p> <br/> And where these two trends intersect, innovation happens. As the Department of Labor fiduciary ruling heightens the demand to serve your clients with greater transparency and greater value, we predict the next big debate in the years ahead will revolve around this fundamental question: How can technology help create value for your practice while also helping you serve your client&rsquo;s best interest and maintain a fiduciary standard?</p><p> The fee-based future is coming. The advisory industry has been moving from commission-based sales to fee-based and fee-only advice, and the pace is accelerating. According to Cerulli, AUM managed by RIAs and fee-based advisers will increase more than 60 % from $4.1 trillion in 2015 to $6.6 trillion in 2019, and RIA and fee-based adviser headcount will expand from 59,000 to 67,000. As more advisers shift to the fee-based and fee-only model, an increasing number of manufacturers and distributors are developing and adopting no-load and fee-based products to fit the way they work.</p><p> The tech obsession is growing. Studies such as Jefferson National&rsquo;s  <i>  Advisor Authority </i>  show that the most successful RIAs and fee-based advisers &mdash; those who earn more and manage more AUM &mdash; adopt technology into their practice at twice the rate of the typical adviser. They use more technology &mdash; and spend more on technology &mdash; to make their practice more seamless, more efficient and more scalable. For the most successful advisers, the only thing more expensive than adding technology is  <i>  not  </i> adding technology.</p><h3> FEE-BASED MOMENTUM</h3><p> <br/> Technology has tremendous power to disrupt, disintermediate and disaggregate at every point in the investing and advising process. As an advocate for innovation in the financial services industry, I&rsquo;ve had a mission and a passion for harnessing emerging technology to create greater value for individual investors and for their advisers.</p><p> As I learned when we founded Telebank, the largest pure-play internet bank, and as I saw during my years running E*Trade, one of the most widely recognized online investing companies, technology helped millions of consumers build more wealth. And as their wealth grows, so does their need for guided advice.</p><p> Today, technology continues driving a secular transformation of the industry, shifting control from manufacturing and distribution directly into the hands of the consumer. It changes the way products are priced, bought and sold. It creates greater transparency. And as consumers continue to become better informed in an increasingly complex market, they not only seek guided advice, they seek unbiased advisers who put their best interest first. </p><p> There is no question that combining unbiased human advice with smart technology can result in better client outcomes.</p><p> According to a recent Financial Engines survey of more than 1,000 American investors, 77% said they would support legally requiring all financial advisers to put their clients&rsquo; best interests first when providing retirement investment advice, and 73% said they felt it was very important that all financial advisers be legally required to meet this standard.</p><p> As evidenced by the momentum of the fee-based and fee-only channel, a growing number of advisers recognize that putting clients&rsquo; best interest first can be good business. And technology provides a clear advantage for these advisers, helping them re-engineer their practice, enhance investing and advising capabilities, and ultimately achieve greater scale so they can serve more clients at every end of the investing spectrum more efficiently and more profitably.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> &ldquo;Going independent was the right choice for our firm. And there was no way to make the move without investing in technology,&rdquo; said Justin Young, CEO of BCJ Financial Group, an RIA firm which broke away from AXA in 2015, and now serves over 700 clients with more $500 million in AUM. &ldquo;Technology has transformed our business operations by driving efficiencies, increasing revenue, and enhancing profits. And it has transformed the client experience, making the relationship more integrated, interactive and truly three-dimensional. From our perspective, there is no question that combining unbiased human advice with smart technology can result in better client outcomes.&rdquo;</p><p> Today, all advisers can streamline basic operations and automate more functions across their entire book of clients with off-the-shelf technology. They can work with different generations of clients exactly the way they want&mdash;from boomers who prefer more face-to-face to millennials who prefer more mobile apps and social media. They can mine data to understand the state of a client&rsquo;s assets more accurately than ever before, and optimize client&rsquo;s portfolios with more sophisticated investing strategies, specialized portfolio construction and advanced risk management techniques.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> ROLE FOR ROBOS</h3><p> <br/> There is also the role that robos can play. While robos alone are not the answer, robos combined with guided advice can help advisers efficiently serve multiple clients across their book of business. Many critics of the DoL ruling have argued that smaller accounts will be ignored because managing them would be cost prohibitive. They suggest that smaller accounts are not profitable enough to justify the workload or the legal liability. And they suggest that commissions paid by product providers to advisers help subsidize the cost of managing a small balance accounts. But both independent RIAs and fee-based advisers at many of the most innovative BDs are integrating robos into their practice as a natural solution for efficiently and competitively serving these smaller balance accounts.</p><p> And, quite unexpectedly, we learned through  <i>  Advisor Authority </i>  that the majority of early adopters are currently using robos for their wealthier clients. Of advisers currently using robos, 52% report that they most often use it for clients with over $1 million in investable assets &mdash; and a full 20% say that they use it most often for clients with over $10 million in investable assets. As advisers have told us, in addition to enhancing the user experience on the front end, these digital advisory solutions can create greater scale on the back end for the low-cost and passively managed portion of any investor&rsquo;s portfolio &mdash; large or small. </p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a question of good or bad. You need to be a digital adviser. And robo advice is one sleeve of that. It can complement your practice. But it&rsquo;s no replacement for financial advice,&rdquo; said Kenny Landgraf, president and chief investment officer of Kenjol Capital Management, a fee-only RIA firm providing services primarily to affluent and high-net-worth individuals and institutions. <b>   &ldquo; </b> As clients build more assets, as their situation becomes more complex, they will want to work with an adviser. In the end, people still want to talk to people.&rdquo;</p><p> Robos also allow advisers to innovate within the confines of an increasingly regulatory world. This move is already taking place on many fronts. <b>  <i>      </i> </b> Manufacturers like BlackRock and Invesco have recently acquired digital-delivery platforms, in part to help comply with DOL policy. Innovative cloud-based solutions like InvestCloud help advisers build their own fully compliant robo solutions, and can be customized with fully integrated modules for portfolio management, document management, client communications and CRM. By providing digital proof points to track the advice that they deliver, robos can help enhance transparency and ease the cost of compliance. This is a massive challenge as the industry estimates project compliance with the DoL fiduciary rule will cost anywhere from $1.1 billion to $2.4 billion.</p><p> As I have seen throughout my career, it is always at the intersection of prevailing trends where the most interesting opportunities for innovation arise. Combine the new DoL fiduciary ruling and the growing demand for guided advice with the rapid adoption of more financial technology and the rapid growth of robo advice. This will lead to more innovation among manufacturers, distributors and technology providers&mdash;all of which benefits advisers and their clients.</p><p> As advances in fintech continue, one thing remains clear: Nothing can replace the value of guided advice and holistic unbiased financial planning. As important financial reforms continue to reshape our industry and more advisers move to independence, technology is not the enemy&mdash;it&rsquo;s the ally that can help advisers like you sit on the same side of the table as your clients. Combine the power of financial technology and the convenience of robo with a human adviser playing by fiduciary rules and you have the best chance to remain relevant to clients&mdash;and the best chance to remain competitive in an industry where the only constant is change.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-16 21:45:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-16 21:45:36.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_BAEYPdi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-future-of-advisors-who-will-be-the-winners/\", \"post_id\": \"12523\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-16 21:45:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-16 21:45:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-future-of-advisors-who-will-be-the-winners\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12522\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6081\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/future-advisors-who-will-be-winners.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1263\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468832400,"author_id":355,"chart_url":""}

You&rsquo;ve got all kinds of stories to share with your friend but sitting across the table from your date your mind draws a blank.</h3><p> <br/> How about when you complain to your cool colleague that you deserve a raise &amp; then during a meeting with your boss you don&rsquo;t bring it up?</p><p> Did you ever notice a difference between telling your mom what you do at work &amp; responding to a stranger who asks, &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; When you&rsquo;re telling your mom about your job responsibilities you&rsquo;re smooth as silk. That same story becomes a bit reduced in quality when telling the stranger, most likely.</p><p> The more we want a particular outcome from a situation the worse our ability to convey our message becomes. Ironic, right? Sometimes I call it, &ldquo;Whenever there&rsquo;s money in it.&rdquo;</p><h3> Being Persuasive When You Need it Most</h3><p> <br/> Can you convince your boss that you need a raise?</p><p> But it&rsquo;s no mystery. In  <strong>  previous posts, </strong>  we&rsquo;ve been talking about evolution and how we go into fight or flight when &ldquo;there&rsquo;s money in it.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s a cool article from Olivia Mitchell talking about  <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.speakingaboutpresenting.com/nervousness/fear-of-public-speaking-causes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Old Brain  </a> </strong> . Here&rsquo;s Paul Drury&rsquo;s take on  <strong>  drawing a blank during an interview </strong> .</p><p> Let&rsquo;s get crystal clear here. When you go to the coffee shop &amp; ask for a coffee, as long as you have 3 dollars &amp; 93 cents you&rsquo;re going to get your coffee. Unless the shop is part of <strong>  <a href=\"http://suspendedcoffees.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John Sweeney&rsquo;s Suspended Coffee program  </a> </strong>  then you don&rsquo;t even need the 3 dollars &amp; 93 cents. You have no fear of the outcome. You&rsquo;re going to get your coffee.</p><p> But when you are in front of an audience you have no idea if they&rsquo;re packing tomatoes. You don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re going to hate you. (They&rsquo;re not, by the way.) If you ask for a raise you don&rsquo;t know if your boss is going to say, &ldquo;What, that&rsquo;s crazy! Your work is fair to middling at best!&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s not.) You don&rsquo;t know if your date is going to like you, or if the person you&rsquo;ve just met will think you&rsquo;re interesting. You don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re going to get the job when you&rsquo;re at the interview. That&rsquo;s what spurs our early human brain. Not knowing the outcome.</p><p> Some tips for getting your pre-frontal cortex in charge again are  <strong>  here. </strong></p><h3> Getting What You Need Out of Life</h3><p> <br/> Can people see how smart &amp; funny you are?</p><p> So think about the different categories of your life. Think about the situations you find yourself in, including the ones you avoid. Then stack &rsquo;em up in order of importance to you. Easy speaking situations at the bottom of the stack; scary ones on top. If you could be earning a better salary, if you could be more successful at nailing that interview, asking your boss for a raise, impressing a new acquaintance with your elevator pitch then you need to improve your ability to communicate during those situations.</p><p> The way to  <strong>  improve your ability to get your message across </strong>  in the situations at the top of the stack is to start at the bottom. Practice the more routine speaking situations of your life (like ordering food &amp; beverages, introducing yourself, making appointments over the phone, etc.) and master those levels. That&rsquo;ll make working on the more complex &amp; terrifying levels easier.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-17 11:02:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-17 11:02:35.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/being-persuasive-are-you-failing-when-you-need-it-most.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/being-persuasive-are-you-failing-when-you-need-it-most/\", \"post_id\": \"12525\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-17 11:02:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-17 11:02:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"being-persuasive-are-you-failing-when-you-need-it-most\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12524\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6084\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/being-persuasive-are-you-failing-when-you-need-it-most.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"570\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468857600,"author_id":202,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5840,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Build an Advisor Brand That Makes you Stand Out","link":"how-to-build-an-advisor-brand-that-makes-you-stand-out","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> What comes to mind when you think about Coca-Cola?</h3><p> <br/> You may be thinking &ldquo; a popular beverage &rdquo;. But, when it comes to their brand, it&rsquo;s more than just a beverage company. Coca-Cola sells happiness, togetherness, and  <strong>  positive emotions </strong> .</p><p> So, when it comes to deciding between buying a Coca-Cola product or a Pepsi product, both are popular beverages and in the same realm. What pushes people to decide is often the emotional connection an individual has to that brand.</p><p> A brand is everything to do with you and your company: who you are, what you stand for, what services you offer, your goals, values, personality, and more.  A brand lives and evolves in the minds and hearts of potential clients.  It is a fostered set of emotions and ideas consumers associate with your company.</p><p> Cultivating a strong brand is crucial to your businesses&rsquo; success, both online and off. There is a lot that goes into building a brand and shaping how others perceive you and your business; from customer testimonials to your value proposition.  Seeing that we are now in a day and age where people will make purchase decisions based off of emotional connections, building a strong brand identity can help build value for your business.</p><p> Just as a brand can drive its prospects to pick them over a similar competitor, your personal brand can drive your prospects to pick you over other Financial Advisors.</p><p> So, ask yourself:</p><h3> <strong>  1. What does my personal brand say about me? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your personal bio is the most powerful branding tool you have. In  <a href=\"http://www.ctrlaltdeletebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mitch Joel&rsquo;s book   Ctrl Alt Delete </a> ,  he talks about &ldquo;digital first&rdquo;. This concept emphasizes that the first place we learn about things (and people) is online. This means that, often times, an individual&rsquo;s first impression of you will be based around how you carry yourself online. Your personal bio is one way to communicate who you are without having to be face to face with prospects and clients.</p><p> On a broader scale, what you communicate on your website and social media defines how you (and your brand) will be perceived by an audience. When you promote yourself as a Financial Advisor, you&rsquo;re promoting what&rsquo;s on the surface of your brand. But, what makes you unique and sets you apart from other Advisors? Do you promote yourself with the idea that you are a unique brand, such as &ldquo;Coca-Cola&rdquo;; a brand that sells happiness, togetherness, and other positive emotions, or just &ldquo;a popular beverage&rdquo;? If you&rsquo;re selling your services by sharing your valuable knowledge with your audience, people will start to build trust with your brand.</p><h3> <strong>  2. What do I WANT my personal brand to say about me? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Are you family-oriented? Do you specialize in a niche area of Financial services like retirement planning? Are you a fan of a specific sports team? Do you use your interests to better connect with clients? If being family-oriented is something that you want to be portrayed to your audience, use images that focus on that throughout your website. Use images and create content that further demonstrate your understanding of your niche market. You can use also social media to humanize your brand further by celebrating your favourite sports team&rsquo;s success. There are so many ways to create a well-rounded personal brand that is true to who you are and what your advisory firm is all about.</p><p> Take a minute and think about what you want people to think (and say) about you and your business. Do you want them to see you as someone that is strictly business or someone that wants to get to know their clients on a more personal level? Even with a digital shift, human interactions are still very important to sales and business processes. A prospect or clients experience with you online (and off) should feel personalized and  human.  You want prospects and clients to connect and relate to your brand on an emotional level. Giving your audience a solid sense of who you are may make them more willing to trust you as an Advisor, which is particularly important in this industry and when competing with other Advisors.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  What does your brand say about you? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Can you identify your values, goals, or uniqueness from what you&rsquo;ve put online? Remember that a brand is not what you say it is, but rather  <strong>  what your consumers say it is </strong> . At the end of the day, do you want to promote yourself as a unique brand, such as  Coca-Cola , or just  a popular beverage?  In other words, do you want your brand to connect with your audience on an emotional level, or be seen as just another Financial Advisor?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-17 11:13:10.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-17 11:13:10.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_YWiKjf2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-build-an-advisor-brand-that-makes-you-stand-out/\", \"post_id\": \"12527\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-17 11:13:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-17 11:13:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-build-an-advisor-brand-that-makes-you-stand-out\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12526\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6085\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-build-advisor-brand-makes-you-stand-out.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"699\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468836000,"author_id":195,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5841,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Toasting Marshmallows (And Other Financial Secrets)","link":"toasting-marshmallows-and-other-financial-secrets","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Remember sitting around the campfire toasting marshmallows? The warm, creamy golden brown deliciousness is etched in our memories. Achieving marshmallow perfection, however, was probably the result of trial and error.  Have you ever seen an overly excited youngster stick a marshmallow on the first stick available and shove it into the nearest roaring flame? The result will undoubtedly be one of two possible outcomes: either the stick is too dry and will burn, causing the marshmallow to be lost in the fire, or the marshmallow will catch fire and become a blackened, molten mess too hot and too ashy to enjoy. It&rsquo;s a disaster in the making.  The lesson is best learned after losing one too many marshmallows: Toasting a marshmallow to perfection requires a green stick and a low flame. Add a slight turning action, and you have the makings of greatness.</p><p> Just as something as ordinary as toasting marshmallows over a campfire requires proper knowledge and experience, so does running your financial life to a toasty golden brown. Inexperience and impatience are the basic ingredients of financial disaster.  Here are a few examples of financial flameouts that are sure to leave an ashy taste in your mouth: </p><li> <strong>  You overhear someone talking about a stock and how it can&rsquo;t miss </strong> &mdash;and your reaction is to go buy it without researching the company or understanding the risk. Irrational exuberance and a fear of missing out fuel bad financial decisions.</li><li> <strong>  You find out that you can take advantage of a stock&rsquo;s price movements by investing in options. </strong>   Puts  and  calls  are bets that the stock will rise or fall over a specified period of time. Although it takes very little capital to buy or sell option positions, the chance of being on the wrong side is huge&mdash;especially if you don&rsquo;t own the underlying security.</li><li> <strong>  You recognize that life insurance is important because you have debt and a family </strong> , so you decide to sign up with your workplace&rsquo;s supplemental life insurance because it&rsquo;s easy and it&rsquo;s cheap. Think dried stick and massive bonfire.  Life insurance is not a throwaway benefit. Inadequate life insurance could mean complete disaster for your family.</li><li> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t make it a priority to build and maintain an emergency fund. </strong> Not having an emergency fund is akin to dousing your marshmallow with gasoline&mdash;the results will be inedible and disastrous when you encounter a job loss, unforeseen emergency or short-term need. <br/>  </li><p> Not having a financial plan that encompasses consideration and careful action is the same as grabbing a dried-out stick and stuffing on 4 or 5 marshmallows and throwing them into the midst of the bonfire.  Failure is all but assured.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> When pondering your financial life, consider the following:</p><li> <strong>  Knowing what you know and what you don&rsquo;t know is a pretty important place to start. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Increase your knowledge where it&rsquo;s lacking. </strong> There are great resources available to you, such as  Jonathan Clements Money Guide 2016 . Hire a CFP &reg;  to help make sure he or she is acting as a  fiduciary  (legally required to act in your best interest).</li><li> <strong>  Think in terms of short-term, mid-range and long-term plans. </strong> For example: An emergency fund is a short-term need; retirement (if you&rsquo;re not about to retire) is a mid- or long-term plan.

{"original_id":5842,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why HR Consultants Have Started to Worry About \"Diversity Fatigue\"","link":"why-hr-consultants-have-started-to-worry-about-diversity-fatigue","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Oftentimes, HR departments face an uphill battle in driving home the message of inclusion and its importance. A radio station host in a major U.S. city even made jokes on the air about attending &ldquo;diversity training&rdquo; when he was really out on the golf course or on vacation.</h3><p> <br/> In  <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21692865-making-most-workplace-diversity-requires-hard-work-well-good-intentions-diversity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a Feb. 13 column in The Economist newspaper </a> , the author quotes late President Ronald Reagan who once said, &ldquo;The nine most terrifying words in the English language are &lsquo;I&rsquo;m from the government, and I&rsquo;m here to help.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> A close second, the writer continues, are 12 words: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from human resources, and I&rsquo;m here to organize a diversity workshop.&rdquo; It may be, the author writes, that some HR consultants have started to worry about &ldquo;diversity fatigue.&rdquo;</p><p> To offer encouragement, The Economist lists powerful reasons in favor of diversity, which is simply a fact about the modern world. The number of women in the workforce, mass immigration, regulations protecting the LGBT community, transgender people in the military and other rulings have transformed Western societies.</p><p> &ldquo;Companies that ignore this may starve themselves of talents, as well as be out of touch with their customers,&rdquo; writes The Economist. In addition, there is evidence to support the idea that people with different ideas and different perspectives can boost creativity and innovation.</p><p> So, why is there talk of diversity fatigue? The Economist cites David Livermore&rsquo;s new book, &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814436536/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lingrenpoph-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0814436536&amp;linkId=eee20ea3b8e852e9241545b27bfc9c62\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Driven by Difference: How Great Companies Fuel Innovation through Diversity </a> .&rdquo; Livermore writes that he has been surprised by how many companies complain about lack of return for their investment in diversity.</p><p> One reason for diversity fatigue, he writes, is that workers may feel forced to attend seminars or be afraid of raising points of view that depart from the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;correct line&rdquo; on diversity-related issues. Livermore contends that proponents of diversity don&rsquo;t acknowledge there can be delays and trade-offs.</p><p> &ldquo;Diversity does not produce better results automatically, through a sort of multicultural magic,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It does so only if it is managed well.&rdquo;</p><p> He says the biggest challenge is establishing trust, because employees need to trust each other if they are to produce their best work. He recommends the following advice for managers of diverse teams:</p><li> Work hard at establishing bonds of trust.</li><li> Set many short-term goals so that the team can see the benefits of working together.</li><li> Recognize the diversity on your team by establishing norms for work processes. For example, Westerners may want to get started immediately on problem-solving, but those from Asian cultures may want to take a slower approach.</li><li> If quieter members in the group won&rsquo;t speak up, give them other ways to contribute to the team&rsquo;s effort. <br/>  </li><p> Another challenge for companies, Livermore says, is to presume that everyone comes from the same background. For example, a Western company might tell its employees to act like an owner. In some cultures, however, that might mean playing golf all day.  </p><p> In addition, companies can&rsquo;t approach diversity as if it were a checkbox by appointing the right number of people with the right biological characteristics. What if they all come from the same background? Is that diverse?</p><p> The Economist&rsquo;s article makes two solid recommendations for HR departments and consultants:</p><li> Promote a culture that is as diverse as possible, but patient as well. &ldquo;Companies will find it hard to make a success of diversity if they refuse to recognize that it brings challenges as well as opportunities.&rdquo;</li><li> Confront any challenges by addressing reasonable questions that are raised about diversity policies. <br/>  </li><p> The bottom line: diversity is just the starting point. Inclusion is a business imperative. Be inclusive!</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-17 11:33:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-17 11:33:02.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_SBtNxpj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-hr-consultants-have-started-to-worry-about-diversity-fatigue/\", \"post_id\": \"12531\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-17 11:33:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-17 11:33:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-hr-consultants-have-started-to-worry-about-diversity-fatigue\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12530\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6087\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-hr-consultants-have-started-worry-about-diversity-fatigue.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"622\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468868400,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5843,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Success: Designing Your Advisory Business Specifically Around the Needs of Targeted Clients","link":"success-designing-your-advisory-business-specifically-around-the-needs-of-targeted-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I meet a lot of advisors who tell me that their goal is to work with women in transition. There are few who undertake an approach as thorough, systematic, and thoughtful as <strong>  Evelyn Zohlen, MBA, MS, CFP&reg;, President of Inspired Financial. </strong></h3><p> <br/> From custom tools and training to tailoring their processes to carefully crafting the language on their website, <a href=\"http://inspiredfinancial.biz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Inspired Financial </a> has designed their advisory business specifically around the needs of their target clients.</p><p> &ldquo;I think most advisors talk themselves out of a niche because they feel like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to end up sending away business.  I&rsquo;m going to end up not growing because I&rsquo;m going to send away business.&rsquo; In fact it is the complete opposite that happens.  When you have clarity around who you want to serve and what you want to do for them, you grow because you become the go-to firm for that niche. Whenever I talk to people about this in a one on one basis with my colleagues, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to send away all that business.&rsquo;  I assure them that you are not losing -- you will not lose business.  You will grow because you will be so important to this particular group.&rdquo;</p><p> Identifying this niche and tailoring their business to it has made a significant difference in how effectively Inspired Financial can attract clients.</p><p> &ldquo;We get a lot of referrals from centers of influence.  I would say probably 75 percent of our referrals come from professional colleagues which is a pretty significant difference from a lot of planners who get lost in the herd. How does that estate attorney know when to send the referral to you versus five other planners who come knocking on his door?  Our niche makes it really easy for our centers of influence to make referrals to us.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;&hellip;All of our website, my blog, our collateral material, my networking when I&rsquo;m meeting with professional colleagues -- it makes it very easy to remember who we are because unfortunately financial planners all look and sound the same.  &lsquo;We help wealthy families and small business owners secure their financial future blah blah blah blah.&rsquo;  That sounds the same everywhere, but to be able to say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not interested in most of your clients.  However, for the ladies that you serve, for your women who are going through big life transitions, we are it.&rsquo;  They get it.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> How do you select that niche? Zohlen recommends you start by looking at your client base to find those clients you really enjoy working with. Then, once you have narrowed the list that far, ask yourself  why  you like working with those people. Which ones make a difference?</p><p> &ldquo;For example, when we did this, we saw two very strong patterns forming and the groups that we like to serve.  There were a surprising number of women in transition, ladies who had come to us during a life transition or who had been with us as part of a couple and then we helped them navigate it when their husband was gone whether through death or divorce.  That was a real surprise.  I wasn&rsquo;t actually expecting that. The other was engineers &ndash; left-brain types that really enjoyed getting into the details of the investments.&rdquo;</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> And asking the question about making a difference helped Inspired Financial recognize who they should target. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we peeled away the engineers.  I like taking care of them because I&rsquo;m a left-brain, technical person by nature.  My MBA is in Finance with a concentration in Portfolio Management.  I could talk all day long on the investments. If you want to go there, I can go as deep as you want. However at the end of the day that really does not provide value.  That is an academic conversation that is interesting to me as a technician but that does not provide long-term value to my clients.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;It actually becomes pretty clear, or at least it narrows down significantly who you are serving best and what it is that you are doing for them that is so wonderful?  When you align that, it&rsquo;s magic.  It completely changes your world.&rdquo;</p><p> The process includes, of course all of the quantitative activities involved in financial planning: Completing projections to make sure the client is on track. But added to that, designed with their target client in mind, and an important part of what makes Inspired Financial special and unique is that there is a qualitative &ldquo;right-brain&rdquo; relational component that they address with purpose and intent as well. Not just about the money but about life and what the client wants to accomplish, whether it should be paid or avocational, and how their family fits into that.</p><p> &ldquo;We have tried and practiced with many, many different approaches and have created one that works well, resonates well.&rdquo; They created a proprietary process based on their experience but Zohlen says that resources from Sudden Money &reg;  Institute and Money Quotient provide a great starting point for planners seeking inspiration in this area.</p><p> &ldquo;Our discovery process not only allows for but anticipates a lot of storytelling, a lot of exchanging &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had that happen&rsquo; or &lsquo;We have another client that&hellip;&rsquo; to show her that while she is singular and unique, perhaps the challenges that are frightening her  <strong>  and  </strong> seem a little bit overwhelming have had successful outcomes with other folks and there is not only hope but great reason for optimism about what is going to come in her future.&rdquo; This is going beyond crunching numbers and into the special needs that define this niche. &ldquo;A lot of these ladies come to us at a really difficult time and they are so uncertain about what is next. What do you want to be next?  How can we help you, not only assuring that you&rsquo;re going to be okay financially but with other support and guidance. The discovery and then the collaboration and the support -- the allowing for tears, the allowing for stories is all part of successfully serving this particular niche.&rdquo;</p><p> When they began working with women in transition, most of their clients were widows and divorcees like they had anticipated. Today approximately 40% of the transitions they work with women on are not death or divorce but changes brought about by business and career&mdash;oftentimes,  a transition Zohlen has dubbed &ldquo;late life involuntary career change.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve seen these stories where she&rsquo;s 58 years old, she was a senior executive at a company and she has been offered a fat severance package and told &lsquo;Thank you for your services but you are no longer needed.&rsquo; Now she has got no job but she&rsquo;s got some money and she is not sure if this is enough and if not, &lsquo; <strong>  Do I have to do the job that I had before making the money I did before </strong> , or is it okay if I do something else because there might be something else that I wanted to do?&rsquo;  Working with those ladies and their transition has been very gratifying as well.&rdquo;</p><p> And how has this new element to the target market changed how Inspired Financial delivers advice? &ldquo;Sometimes that entails bringing her to a career coach or maybe a job placement center to do a little bit of exploration around what else she might like to do.  Sometimes it is just giving her permission to take a sabbatical.  &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to go back to being a CPA but I&rsquo;m just tired of it.  I think I just need six months off to recharge my batteries a little bit.&rsquo;  We&rsquo;ll discern that that is the case.  It&rsquo;s not that she wants to retire and quit at age 58, but she just needs a breather.  We tell her how she can do that and still be successful. </p><p> That is not technical.  That is not 40 percent stocks and 60 percent bonds.  That&rsquo;s much more about a comprehensive approach to somebody&rsquo;s entire financial life and making it successful.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I will make the half joke that we&rsquo;re the ones that, when your dad dies and your mom doesn&rsquo;t know how to take care of the finances or your sister divorces that bum she never should have married in the first place, we&rsquo;re going to make sure she and the kids are okay. People hear that and they get it.  They completely resonate.  That means internally we are all on the same sheet of music.  If you hold out any team member of Inspired Financial, cornered them and said, &lsquo;Who do you take care of?  What do you do for them?&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve got this woman in transition thing completely dialed in.  Our services are geared toward them; our communications are geared toward them.&rdquo;</p><p> What advice does Zohlen have for advisors trying to identify their niche? &ldquo;Stick to your guns but know that, as soon as you put a stake in the ground and say &lsquo;This is my niche,&rsquo; the next eight people through your will not be a part of your niche.  It&rsquo;s just Murphy&rsquo;s Law; it&rsquo;s the way it works. That&rsquo;s exactly what happened to us.  I put the stake in the ground, women in transition, $1 million minimum, and over the next couple of months I proceeded to send away about $8 million in $500,000 increments with couples and men and all kinds of random situations.&rdquo;</p><p> Focusing on a niche and tailoring their services to the needs of those target clients has enabled  <strong>  Inspired Financial </strong>  to accomplish what many advisors aspire to &ndash; a successful practice with consistent referrals, 75% of which come from centers of influence.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-17 11:45:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-17 11:45:05.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_FLgM5kF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/success-designing-your-advisory-business-specifically-around-the-needs-of-targeted-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"12533\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-17 11:45:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-17 11:45:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"success-designing-your-advisory-business-specifically-around-the-needs-of-targeted-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12532\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6088\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/success-designing-your-advisory-business-specifically-around-needs-targeted.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"835\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468828800,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5844,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Reasons Physical Fitness Is Vital to Leadership","link":"5-reasons-physical-fitness-is-vital-to-leadership","source_link":null,"content":"<h3>Does physical fitness have any bearing on leadership abilities?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe phrase &ldquo;fit to lead&rdquo; dates back to the early 1800&rsquo;s. A leader needed to be spiritually, mentally and physically fit enough to lead a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same could be said today especially physically. Leadership is a taxing position that requires a certain amount of endurance, confidence and decisiveness, all of which have a direct link to the physical state of the body. True to the adage mens sana in corpora sano (&ldquo;healthy mind in a healthy body&rdquo;), it is essential to maintain a high level of fitness to keep motivated and disciplined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important as leaders to be actively tuned into the rhythms of our body and the fluctuations of energy we might have throughout each day. Too many leaders put so much energy into leading and achieving that they forget about how important it is to maintain fitness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? Here are 5 reasons physical fitness is vital to leadership:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. The law of mimicry </strong> .</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies have shown that regular team members unconsciously mimic the behavior patterns of their leader. If a leader is undisciplined or not punctual, their subordinates tend to follow suit. In the same way, a leader who does not make caring for her body and health a priority will have team members who will mirror this as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Mental wellness. </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Exercise is one of the best ways to manage stress because it boosts your brain&rsquo;s &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; neurotransmitters called endorphins. Also, by solely focusing on your body&rsquo;s motions for a period of time, you focus less on the day&rsquo;s stresses, at least for a while. According to an article by the <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/exercise-and-stress/SR00036\" target=\"_blank\"> Mayo Clinic </a> , exercise also reduces symptoms associated with anxiety and depression while improving sleeping patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Creativity </strong> .</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being physically fit gives a leader the ability and brain space to use creative thinking to its utmost. Studies suggest that even moderate levels of exercise increase cognitive abilities and will help you make better decisions and design creative business strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Productivity </strong> .</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like a car that is top condition and filled with gas can go on long trips without incident, so a body that is physically fit can produce all that it is required to produce.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5.

{"original_id":5845,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Are Students Prone to Making Wrong Career Choices?","link":"why-are-students-prone-to-making-wrong-career-choices","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Many students actually plan their careers ahead. They make up their minds as to what they want to become in the future. These plans are often in the form of dreams and aspirations, which they are serious about achieving sooner or later. They also believe that getting the right course in university is vital for their career success in the future. This is true, of course, but there&rsquo;s more they need to learn in order to make the right decisions. When their thought process is wrong, they are likely to think illogically.</p><h3> Why Are Students Prone to Making Wrong Career Choices?</h3><h3> <br/> Peer Pressure</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s common for students to make decisions that they ideally are not ready to make. Students who are pressured by their peers tend to choose a career path that does not suit them. Basically, when a student pursues a stream of education that he or she doesn&rsquo;t really want, they are not likely to pursue getting a job in that field. What happens next is they will try to look for something else they are more interested in. And there goes the first sign of a wrong choice of career.</p><h3> Following Parents&rsquo; Desires</h3><p> <br/> Parents guide us throughout our lives, and they always try to help us make decisions, even those that affect our careers. Thus, it&rsquo;s common for students to decide according to what their parents want for them. This is not ideal, however, as students need to choose a career path based on their own desires and passion. Choosing a career that your parents want for you is an immature way of deciding on your career path.</p><h3> Market Trends</h3><p> <br/> Many students also make the mistake of picking a stream of education based on the trends in the market. But just because a particular profession is in demand at the moment does not mean it will be a few years later. What many students don&rsquo;t realize is that by the time they graduate and enter the workforce, the demands of a certain market would have changed already. Thus, it&rsquo;s always best to choose a career path that you really want to belong to.</p><h3> What Should You Do?</h3><p> <br/> As a student, the first thing you need to do is find the path of education that you will remain interested in for many years. You need to figure out what you are passionate about and make a decision based on what you are passionate about. Also, do a lot of research about the kinds of careers a particular educational degree may lead to. If possible, you also want to  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/individuals/career-coaching/career-coaching/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  consult a career coaching expert </a>  early on so you can receive proper guidance in choosing a stream of education and career path.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 12:54:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 12:54:48.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_AjzUGPM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-are-students-prone-to-making-wrong-career-choices/\", \"post_id\": \"12537\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 12:54:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 12:54:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-are-students-prone-to-making-wrong-career-choices\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12536\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6090\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-are-students-prone-making-wrong-career-choices.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1492\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468944000,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5846,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Blindsided by Divorce","link":"blindsided-by-divorce","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Divorce often comes as a surprise to one half of the relationship. Oftentimes an unhappy partner or spouse will &ldquo;blindside&rdquo; their partner and surprise them by asking for a divorce. This leaves their other half in sadness but mostly shock.</p><p> In a previous blog I wrote about Sudden Divorce Syndrome, I wrote about how women are by and large the ones that instigate a divorce. Although it might appear to her spouse that&rsquo;s her decision is sudden, it&rsquo;s actually quite the opposite. She feels that her ongoing attempts have fallen on deaf ears and her decision to divorce wasn't sudden at all, but a slow burn of a marriage that has become unhealthy and unfulfilling. Yet, I was quickly reminded that many men who try &ndash; very hard and diligently - to salvage their marriage, work equally hard at the marriage and continue to show up, only to find themselves still blindsided by their spouse.</p><h3> Here are a few of their stories (names and identifying information has been changed to protect their privacy). </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Bill </strong> :   I was blindsided because my wife was simply emotionally dishonest. I tried to address our issues in the marriage, but she never was interested. Even when I asked her directly what was wrong, what was bothering her, she refused to answer honestly. I was shocked to discover an email while I was away from work saying that she didn't want to go on any longer and did not love me the way I needed to be loved anymore! I couldn't believe what I was reading. Prior to receiving that email, we had recently spent time traveling. She often professed her love for me through giving me cards. So, of course I never thought the relationship was ever that bad; I never expected that she would simply ' up and leave.' But she did. Shortly thereafter, I found out that she had been having an affair for almost a year and a half and, when asked, she simply lied. Just like that. I didn't see our situation as not paying attention to each other&rsquo;s needs. I just felt used.</p><p> <strong>  David </strong> <strong>  : </strong>  I am now divorced after almost 17 years together, 12 of which we were married. I was definitely blindsided and shocked by her decision to divorce. I had no idea that she was contemplating divorce. Actually, no one did &ndash; not our family nor our friends. Everyone was shocked. However, my spouse claims there were plenty of hints. To be honest, there were hints that I ignored, but certainly \"hinting\" is not clear communication. I &ndash; nor should anyone &ndash; be expected to read someone's mind. If someone is contemplating divorce, why can't they be upfront and honest about it? Why can't they say, \"I'm hurting so much I can't continue in this relationship as it is now. If things don't change I want to divorce.\" Clear and unambiguous communication would get a partner's attention and provide a chance for the marriage to survive. Planning an exit strategy in silence and dropping a bomb provides no hope for the marriage to survive.</p><p> <strong>  Saul: </strong>  My attorney and a few friends told me that, in most divorces, there is one spouse that is well ahead of the other &ndash; both emotionally and mentally. They have had time to think about what they want. It&rsquo;s how couples start to uncouple. This often means that they go from fine to divorced with little warning. The unexpecting half is left stunned that the other isn't willing to make any effort to save the marriage. It happens to both men and women. The one who is ready always has justification. In my case, my wife was having an affair, which, as it turns out, is pretty common &ndash; quite the blow to my ego. Things had not been great for a while. She might self-justify her behavior, but I certainly don't see her as the noble wife who'd tried everything and then gave up. It makes sense now that a once dead bedroom became alive again and she became more pleasant to be around and interested in me. It was all just a cover.</p><p> <strong>  Paul: </strong> My wife totally blindsided me. I consider myself a very communicative person; I address things head on and always asked her to make it clear if something was bothering her as well. However, she apparently held everything in until one night I asked what was wrong. She crushed me. We spent time together always and she always acted happy. We spoke about moving to another city and starting a family. I believe she may have some mental issues that I know about in her past and what she has gone through, which may be part of it. We dated for 8 years and were married almost 6. We were high school sweethearts. I even went away to college for four years and it worked being apart. So her asking for a divorce simply made no sense. I did everything and showed her I loved her every single day.</p><p> This was more than being blindsided - I felt enormous shock and disbelief. It took me a long time to wrap my head around what had actually happened. It took a long time to heal and move on.</p><p> It says a lot about a person who is able to sit down and explain why they want out of the marriage than it does to up and leave without an explanation. Not getting the 'punch line' makes it that much more challenging to overcome. And, people want and need the punch line. Getting an explanation helps provide clarity and hopefully a better understanding. But, many people are not able or willing to do that.</p><p> That&rsquo;s unfortunate because divorce is hard enough.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 13:42:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 13:42:45.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_OQzFMEq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/blindsided-by-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"12539\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 13:42:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 13:42:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"blindsided-by-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12538\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6091\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/blindsided-divorce.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2137\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468954800,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5847,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Be a Drifter: Why You Need to Come up with a Plan for Your Life","link":"dont-be-a-drifter-why-you-need-to-come-up-with-a-plan-for-your-life","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Summer holidays can be a great opportunity for reflection. Whether you are lying on a beach or enjoying a sightseeing vacation, I wonder if you&rsquo;ve reflected on a plan for your life? <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;m conscious that can sound a bit worthy, or overly ambitious.</p><p> But, consider for a moment, how many important priorities in your business would you seek to achieve without a plan?</p><p> Is your life and what you want to achieve with your life actually less important than those business goals?</p><p> Given the importance of this topic and the fact that I still find most leaders lack any form of &lsquo;life plan&lsquo;, I&rsquo;m delighted to review a new book to help you create one.</p><p> A bestseller already, &ldquo;Living Forward&ldquo; is co-authored by leading influencer Michael Hyatt and coaching expert Daniel Harkavy.</p><h3> Accessible <br/>  </h3><p> My first encouragement, as to why you should read this book, is that it&rsquo;s short. Excluding appendices, it&rsquo;s just over 150 pages. The writing style is warm, accessible &amp; practical. Both authors share a wide variety of personal stories and examples of how they have implemented what they recommend, together with what happened as a result.</p><p> The structure of the book is a simple three part process. First, three short chapters on understanding your need for a life plan. Second, four short chapters laying out a process to create your life plan (including the practical aspects of where and how long you need). Finally, three short chapters on &lsquo;making it happen&rsquo;. That is, how to put your plan into action and maintain progress.</p><p> As well as the authors sharing personal experience &amp; practical application tips, there are a number of free online resources provided. Readers can benefit from the templates, audiobook and questionnaires available on the supporting website. Plenty of thought has gone into helping you overcome you lethargy and actually do this.</p><h3> Why you need a life plan <br/>  </h3><p> In part one, Michael &amp; Daniel make a strong case for why we all need life plans (especially leaders). Starting with the analogy of a life plan as a &lsquo;sat nav for your life journey&rsquo; they go on to identify a critical barrier to why so many of us don&rsquo;t achieve what we want with our lives. This they call &lsquo;the drift&rsquo;.</p><p> Drifting is metaphor they use to help us recognise why we often end up at destinations we did not intend. Whether it's being sucked into our career being all-consuming, focussing on wealth generation at the expense of other priorities, or just not noticing who we are giving time to. This first section helps the reader see why drifting through life is a real danger &amp; the benefits of being more intentional with the time, talents &amp; resources we do have.</p><p> This section also provides 3 powerful questions that you can ask yourself to begin organising your life plan &amp; setting your priorities.</p><h3> A blueprint for creating life plans <br/>  </h3><p> The central 4 chapters step the reader through a practical &amp; simple process to create your own life plan.</p><p> This begins in a very similar way to the Franklin Covey method, that I&rsquo;ve shared previously. Imagining your own funeral and what you would want all the people who matter to you (family, friends, work colleagues etc) to say about you after you have gone. So simple a concept and yet still a powerful emotional exercise to do sincerely.</p><p> Next, the writers introduce the concept of &lsquo;life accounts&rsquo; to help you consider all the aspects of your life where you might want to create goals. For instance, this might include: your relationship with your significant other; with your children/grandchildren; your career or business; your financial legacy; your personal fitness; perhaps your faith or a passion in your life. In this area they also prompt aspects that some self-improvement books are prone to overlook (like vocational work in community or hobbies, as well as holidays &amp; leisure time).</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> With helpful structure &amp; prompting questions, the authors then step you through the process of writing your life plan. That is, how to translate that high-level vision (your intended obituaries) into specific goals for each of the life accounts that matter to you. Everyone&rsquo;s life plan &amp; even style of life plan will differ, but they share enough examples to inspire new perspectives as well as how you might articulate what you want.</p><p> The last chapter in this section deals with the practical issue of protecting time to do this. Although this may put off some readers, I believe they are right to say you need to dedicate a day to creating your life plan. After all, one day is not a huge investment in the context of the rest of your life. There are also hints and ideas on location and the resources you&rsquo;ll need.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Staying on course <br/>  </h3><p> Too often plans can be beautiful, but never see the light of being actioned. You don&rsquo;t want to put in all this effort &amp; then just leave a plan for your life on the shelf.</p><p> So, the final section focusses on how to keep on track. The first of the final three chapters focusses on the practical aspects of implementing your plan. Here they rightly touch on the need to prioritise and create what Michael calls &lsquo;margin&rsquo; to give time for what you proactively want to achieve based on your life plan goals. Plenty of the ideas here are the way to address why so many leaders drift through their years, with days full of answering emails &amp; attending meetings.</p><p> Next comes a chapter on the discipline of periodic review and reflection. Suggesting a pattern of short reviews weekly, quarterly and yearly. This approach helps ensure that your life plan continues to be a living document that grows &amp; adapts as your life changes &amp; new opportunities emerge or you see things differently. Useful prompts as to the benefits of coaching and mentoring here, although I would personally of liked to see more of those (but then I&rsquo;m a coach who sees too few leaders recognise their need of one).</p><p> The closing chapter of the book is a rallying cry to &lsquo;join the revolution&rsquo;. That might sound a bit cheesy (or &lsquo;overly American&rsquo; as we Brits are fond of expressing our mild xenophobia), but it is an interesting challenge. The suggestion is simple. Share this book with others, buy books for your team members or in other ways encourage those around you to create life plans too.</p><h3> What about you? <br/>  </h3><p> I hope you found that book review helpful. Reading &ldquo;Living Forward&rdquo; is easy to do but will also challenge you to actually put this into action. Creating your own life plan is where the real benefits come.

{"original_id":5848,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Picking the Right Smart Beta: The Speed Dating Approach","link":"picking-the-right-smart-beta-the-speed-dating-approach","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Choices. They can be wonderful. But all too often, the availability of too many choices leaves us paralyzed and, ultimately, unable to make any choice at all. I&rsquo;m no wine connoisseur, so when I open a 5-page wine list, I&rsquo;m instantly overwhelmed. My default: I ask the waiter for a recommendation. The problem with that approach is twofold. First, it&rsquo;s very possible the waiter knows even less about the wine list than I do. Second, even if the waiter does know each of the wines well, he or she is missing a critical piece of information: my preferences.</p><p> In the investment world, advisors face this product proliferation challenge every day as the already vast menu of available &ldquo;smart beta&rdquo; or &ldquo;strategic beta&rdquo; products continues to grow at lightning speed. After emerging in response to the financial crisis, by December 2010, there were 125 strategic beta products on the market, with $175B in assets under management (AUM)*. According to a recent Morningstar report, those numbers shot to 560 products and $452B AUM by December 31, 2015. And while having choices is great in theory, with 560+ strategic beta products to choose from&mdash;and more being added every day&mdash;where do you even begin?</p><p> Of course, taking my wine list approach puts you at much more risk than simply being served a less-than-stellar bottle of Syrah. Unlike choosing a wine for your meal, selecting an asset manager is more like choosing a spouse: you end up marrying the whole family, so you better be darned sure you share their outlook on life! The choice is highly personal, and depends on your own approach and the preferences and needs of your clients. And because choosing the right funds from this set of diverse and highly nuanced products is one of your most important investment decisions, it&rsquo;s time for some serious speed dating.</p><h3> <strong>  Speed Dating 101 </strong></h3><p> The point of speed dating is to cut to the chase. Be honest about what you want, honest about who you are and, ultimately, stop wasting time with anyone who&rsquo;s not a potential match. While I have no idea how effective it is in the dating world, when it comes to culling down the menu of strategic beta products, speed dating can help eliminate product paralysis by eliminating the wrong choices, identifying potential winners, and helping you make the choice that&rsquo;s right for you&mdash;in a timely manner.</p><h3> Step 1: Clarify your own philosophy <br/>  </h3><p> Before you step out to find the right match, it&rsquo;s important to be as clear as possible about your own philosophy. While strategic beta products are, at their core, alternatives to passive index investing, how active do you want to go? Is your focus on reduced risk or enhanced returns? Most importantly, what client outcome are you seeking? Every firm has a specialty, and your goal is to identify the one that delivers the best possible match.</p><h3> Step 2: Create a short list <br/>  </h3><p> With your written philosophy as the driver, start eliminating the firms that clearly don&rsquo;t fit. If you don&rsquo;t prefer white wines, that 5-page wine list just got cut in half. If you&rsquo;re more conservative, knock out those asset managers that lean toward a more active approach and focus on those who take a more passive approach. Next, look at the characteristics of their funds. Are the focused on value?  <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/exchange-traded-funds/strategies/capital-appreciation?cmpid=ETFTrends-post-smart-beta-speed-dating-text-70116\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Growth? </a>  Dividends? What is the expense ratio? Again, cross off the &ldquo;no-match&rdquo; options and cull your list down to those with real potential.</p><h3> Step 3: Perform due diligence <br/>  </h3><p> Steps 1 and 2 qualify as speed dating. Step 3 is the real deal. You&rsquo;ve already made the decision that the firm as a whole is a strong match for you, but a single firm may offer multiple products to choose from. This is the long dinner date (but with a much shorter wine list!), and it&rsquo;s time to ask some serious questions&mdash;and get some serious answers. Remember, your goal is to build on the strategic core or your portfolio, and you&rsquo;re considering a long-term marriage here, so be careful, be honest, and be choosy. Here are 7 key questions to kick off the conversation:</p><li> <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/etf/documents/white-papers/why-flexshares.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  How was the product created? </a>  Is it based on proven fundamentals, or is it designed with new bells and whistles to attract investors?</li><li> What are the risk constraints around those ideas? How do you manage success?</li><li> Has the product delivered stable, consistent outcomes? How long is the track record?</li><li> How does the risk exposure affect the client experience when the product achieves its objectives? What about when it doesn&rsquo;t?</li><li> When has the product over- or under-performed? What were the factors that drove each outcome?</li><li> What are the tradeoffs for performance versus risk?</li><li> How does the strategy affect the composition of my overall portfolio model?</li><p> By now you should have a pretty strong understanding of the product and how it fits with your philosophy, your portfolio, and your clients&rsquo; desired outcomes. And just like dating, it&rsquo;s time to let your intuition kick in. If the product sounds like a good fit, ask yourself: Does it fit my specific needs? Does the asset manager think like I do? Does it feel like they&rsquo;re in the business of marketing or delivering a solid investment tool? Be honest with yourself and trust your instincts. In the end, you should be able to narrow the menu down to a fund with the right balance of risk exposure, potential for growth, and even personality. Not bad for your first foray into the world of the strategic beta speed date.</p><p> Want to learn more about smart beta ETFs and how they can benefit your clients?

{"original_id":5849,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Wirehouse Advisor's Guide to Retirement","link":"a-wirehouse-advisors-guide-to-retirement","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> All of the major wirehouses have established sunset programs which allow an advisor to monetize the business at retirement. <br/>  </h3><p> Unfortunately, these programs typically permit little customization and contain provisions which tie the business to the firm.</p><p> The good news for advisors who have reached this point in their career is that options exist outside of the firms&rsquo; programs. So before signing on the dotted line, advisors should consider the future of their business, as well as the best way to ensure their own financial security.</p><p> As a starting point, advisors should ask themselves the following questions:</p><h3> Do I want to leave my legacy at my current firm?  <br/>  </h3><p> The answer for some is an unequivocal &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, since it is the least disruptive and lowest risk option. Also, for advisors who have spent a career at a firm, loyalty and continuity are often cited as reasons for choosing to stay the course. Others feel that their firm has changed so much, they no longer believe it is the right place to leave their business and clients. These advisors will perform due diligence on other industry options to determine if making a move could represent a substantial uptick.</p><h3> Do I have a team or have I identified a successor that I feel comfortable entrusting my clients to?  <br/>  </h3><p> Many retiring advisors struggle to find the right next generation for the business within their office. Oftentimes a different investment approach, style or work ethic will derail a potential teaming arrangement that looks good on paper, but in practice just doesn&rsquo;t feel right. If a retiring advisor cannot find the right person within his/her own office, this will often prompt the advisor to look outside the firm to exponentially increase the number of potential &ldquo;suitors&rdquo;.</p><h3> Do the economics work?  Do I feel I am getting fair value for the business and is it sufficient to support my needs for retirement?  <br/>  </h3><p> Although all of the major firms have enhanced their retiring advisor sunset programs, these programs pay an advisor substantially less than a transition deal from a wirehouse would, and less than what an advisor would receive by selling a business on the open market. That said, if an advisor feels that his firm is the best place for the business and clients, then retiring from the current firm &ndash; and in effect accepting a &ldquo;lower valuation&rdquo; &ndash; makes sense and provides the benefits of continuity and stability. Conversely, if an advisor feels that the firm is no longer the right home, then it is possible to achieve better economics by making a well-timed move prior to retirement.</p><h3> I&rsquo;m ready to &ldquo;ride off into the sunset&rdquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s next? <br/>  </h3><p> Even for advisors who answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the above questions and anticipate that retiring from their current firm is the right choice, there are still some things to consider.</p><li> In order to be eligible for a wirehouse retirement plan you typically need to have formed a team at least 3 years prior to your intended retirement.</li><li> Payout to the retiring advisor generally extends, on a declining basis, for 3 to 5 years. The funds to buy out a retiring advisor&rsquo;s business essentially come from the team&rsquo;s production. Although the firm may advance or backstop these payments, it is not paying for the book.</li><li> Wirehouse retirement plans allow for little flexibility or customization, and family teams often find the rules restrictive. Often family teams will opt out of the firm&rsquo;s sunset program and the retiring advisor will simply assign the book to the junior partner/heir apparent and establish a side financial agreement. In this arrangement, the book remains entirely portable since there are no strings attached to the firm.</li><li> Retiring advisor agreements contain language that ties the business to the firm, typically for 3 to 5 years following the retirement date. These retirement agreements trump the Broker Protocol, effectively binding the retired advisor&rsquo;s business for several years and in effect eliminating options for the team until the agreement is up. Advisors who choose to leave the firm before the agreement has expired will face penalties.</li><p> If after careful consideration an advisor determines that leaving his legacy at the current firm is not the right solution, then moving prior to retirement will be necessary. If an advisor plans to work for at least 5 years post move, there is the opportunity to move to a wirehouse or regional firm, earn an aggressive transition deal and then retire under the new firm&rsquo;s sunset program&mdash;effectively moving once and monetizing the business twice. Alternatively, for those advisors or teams with entrepreneurial DNA, moving to an independent model and selling the business upon retirement is a viable solution which yields attractive economics and the tax benefits of business ownership.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> At the end of the day, there are many different ways an advisor can approach succession planning and multiple avenues that can ensure clients are protected, while the value of the business is maximized. The key however, is to start thinking about retirement planning well in advance of an intended retirement date and being strategic and thoughtful in considering all of the options, both inside and outside the current firm.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 15:50:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 15:50:45.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_zuubY2k.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-wirehouse-advisors-guide-to-retirement/\", \"post_id\": \"12545\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 15:50:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 15:50:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-wirehouse-advisors-guide-to-retirement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12544\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6096\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wirehouse-advisors-guide-retirement.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1063\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468922400,"author_id":502,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5850,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Make Room for Travel in Your Life","link":"how-to-make-room-for-travel-in-your-life","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Almost everyone wants to travel. We talk about it, fantasize about it and hold on to the good memories for months after we&rsquo;ve returned home. <br/>  </h3><p> So why don&rsquo;t people travel more?</p><p> Whether it&rsquo;s a lack of finances or an overabundance of responsibilities, it usually boils down to an inability to fit travel into our lives. To make matters worse, people tend to turn the vacations they can afford to take into a big, stressful, expensive mess &ndash; killing their motivation to book another trip in the near future.</p><p> So how can you make room for more than one high-stress vacation a year? How can you make travel a sustainable, enjoyable and indispensable part of your life?</p><h3> Find Your Destination <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed when planning a big trip. The options can seem endless, especially if you haven&rsquo;t traveled a lot. That&rsquo;s why it helps to get clear on what you want to see and do on your trip. Ask yourself some of the following questions:</p><li> Are you hoping to have an outdoors adventure full of hiking and other activities?</li><li> Do you want to see medieval churches and old castles?</li><li> Do you prefer a cosmopolitan city or a quiet village?</li><li> Are you comfortable speaking another language or do you want to go somewhere English-speaking</li><li> How long will your trip be?</li><li> Are you a hotel kind of person or do you prefer tents or cabins in the woods?</li><p> Once you&rsquo;ve narrowed down what you&rsquo;re looking for, try searching online for places or countries that match that description. Then, you can read online resources about those places and determine if they still sound like somewhere you want to go. This can include information tourism sites, travel forums and more.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to get off the beaten path. Just because millions of people flock to London and Paris every year doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to as well. If Budapest is more your thing, then go there. Travel is not something most people can afford to do often, so it&rsquo;s important to go where you want &ndash; not where you think you should go.</p><p> After you&rsquo;ve determined your location, you need to find the best time to go. That will depend on when you can take off from work, how much travel costs during a particular season and what season you prefer to travel in.</p><p> Once you know when you want to go, you can start developing a rough budget. Then you&rsquo;ll know exactly how much you need to save.</p><h3> Fund Your Trip <br/>  </h3><p> If a trip abroad isn&rsquo;t within your current budget, it&rsquo;s time to find ways to make more money. A trip outside the country can cost several thousand dollars depending where you go. So how can you find that kind of money quickly? Try renting out your place on Airbnb.</p><p> Airbnb is a great way to make money for people comfortable with sharing their space. How much you earn depends on your city, the time of year and what kinds of amenities your home has. If you have an extra room it can be a great way to make between $66 and $111 a night for renting out something you&rsquo;re not using. Some hosts make enough to pay their rent in full.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Plus, you can rent out your room when you leave on vacation (or the whole place if you don&rsquo;t have any roommates). Being an Airbnb host doesn&rsquo;t require any special skills beyond being friendly and accommodating to tourists.</p><p> Some other money-making ideas include freelancing in your chosen industry, participating in clinical trials, tutoring college and high school students, and picking up retail shifts during the busy season.</p><h3> Make Travel a Priority <br/>  </h3><p> Travel is on the wish list of many of my clients. The best thing you can do for yourself is set up separate travel savings account and stash money aside on a monthly or consistent basis to ensure you&rsquo;re building up a fund to cover the costs of your trip. It&rsquo;s easy to pull out your credit card to cover expenses, but your trip won&rsquo;t be nearly as fun as if you head into it debt free and with the money available to cover expenses.</p><p> No matter how you choose to fund or save for your trip, the key is to make your travel plans as painless and straightforward as possible. Making room for travel isn&rsquo;t just about paying for the cost &ndash; it&rsquo;s about fitting travel into your lifestyle in a sustainable and enjoyable way.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 15:57:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 15:57:05.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_8zaWhug.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-make-room-for-travel-in-your-life/\", \"post_id\": \"12547\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 15:57:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 15:57:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-make-room-for-travel-in-your-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12546\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6097\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-make-room-travel-your-life.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"595\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468936800,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}

The only way one can really know, is by asking clients and prospects in each area directly.</p><p> The most effective way I have found is a market research event (MRE for short). You can do an MRE for your existing clients and prospects. First, find out what is working for your client base. Second, develop a strategy to market to demographics absent from your client base. </p><p> Recently, I facilitated an MRE for one of my financial advisors to learn more about his existing clients. Some of the information we gleaned from the process was astounding and quite groundbreaking. This information also challenged some closely held beliefs about the practice. Here is what we found in our research:</p><li> Dress Code: In his location, suits are out. His clients said they were too formal for the relationship they had with him.</li><li> Communcation: Clients hated the weekly market communications he had been using for years. They did not think it was beneficial information and did not read it.</li><li> Referrals: His clients were afraid to refer due to service decline perception.</li><li> Services: This advisor was too afraid to come across as salesy, so clients had no idea what else the advisor could do for them. When I brought up a few of the things he did exceptionally well, they all said they wanted him to toot his horn more.</li><p> Clients sweat that this was the best way to get their message out, show a willingness to respond to local market conditions, and gain new business. So, we conducted an MRE for prospects as well. We recruited over a dozen local business leaders and prospects, none of them current clients. Here is a synopsis of their feedback after the process:</p><li> Ability to Refer: They all love to refer, if they know exactly what you do and why it benefits them. It makes them look like well-connected business people in the area.</li><li> Services Offered to Wealthy Business Owners: Most of the business owners in this room wanted transactions not a plan. Their plan is their business.</li><li> How Many Advisors They Have and/or Want: Every business person in this room had at least three advisors the most had seven. Each of the advisors does something specific. They did not like generalists.</li><li> What Products and Services They Are Looking For: The biggest opportunity we found from this group is alternative investments. They want them, know little about them, and are more than happy to pay a commission for your expertise.</li><p> There are wonderful coaches, consultants and companies who do research all of whom offer great research and information. For my clients, I wanted to go to the horses mouth. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Some pieces of feedback that came out of the MREs really supported their research, but other pieces actually negated it; something to take under serious consideration. Instead of just taking other peoples word for it; have the courage and interest to actually ask your clients and prospects in your area what they really want, instead of what we think they want.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 16:09:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 16:09:33.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/are-you-asking-your-clients-what-they-actually-want.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-asking-your-clients-what-they-actually-want/\", \"post_id\": \"12549\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 16:09:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 16:09:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-asking-your-clients-what-they-actually-want\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12548\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6098\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/are-you-asking-your-clients-what-they-actually-want.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"647\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468922400,"author_id":334,"chart_url":""}

It can drive leads, boosts sales, improve SEO standings, and much more. But there are a couple of glaring problems with content today; oversaturation and repetition. <br/>  </h3><p> Because content marketing is so effective brands are churning out blogs, articles, and other content faster than bacteria can multiply, making it incredibly difficult to stand out and get noticed. Even worse, much of what is produced is the same ol&rsquo; rehashed drivel that can be accessed on gazillions of other sites. So how are you supposed to gain any traction with your genius creations? Controversy. Dare to go there, and eyeballs will take note.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not simply advocating shock value like some sort of corporate Marilyn Mason, but I do champion stances that are strongly opinionated and have the potential to spark intrigue, pique interests, and maybe even an argument or two. If this scares you, it shouldn&rsquo;t. What should scare you is posing points that are so vanilla that no one pays you any mind; that is social suicide.</p><p> People love controversy. They by no means shy away from it and in today&rsquo;s socially transparent world, and many seek it out. Donald Trump, anyone? Bullseye.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a look at how contentious content can benefit your business.</p><h3> Build Brand Loyalty <br/>  </h3><p> Controversy will likely not build loyalty for all of your customers, and a small percentage may even abandon your brand, and that&rsquo;s okay. View this as akin to the &ldquo;follow unfollow&rdquo; strategy for Twitter; you get rid of the people that were never all that into you to begin with, and you replace those folks with more dedicated customers.</p><p> The people that stick with your brand, and even the new ones who discover it, will be passionate and enthusiastic proponents. By projecting a viewpoint that consumers truly believe in, they trust your company is on the same team as they are. And your profits will reflect as much.</p><h3> Engagement Extravaganza <br/>  </h3><p> Content that takes a stance is much easier to engage with than one that has no voice. By expressing a strong opinion, others will feel the need to do the same and chime in to agree or disagree (both are awesome, by the way.) People love to be right, so the comment section alone is likely to spark debates among those who are interacting.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Through people commenting, discussing, and possibly even arguing, your thread has the chance to blow-up and bring others into the conversation. If you manage to get your audience talking, it will draw more attention to your company and make individuals feel more invested in your brand.</p><h3> Convey Conviction and Authority <br/>  </h3><p> By displaying your company&rsquo;s strong viewpoint about a given subject, you are showing your audience that your brand has perspectives it is willing to stand for. The companies that never lean one way or the other either appear untrustworthy or downright boring to audiences; both of which are the antithesis of what you are trying to cultivate. By voicing opinions loud and proud, you are creating a level of transparency within your brand; something that today&rsquo;s consumers not only crave, but now demand.</p><p> It is important to note, however, that when producing this type of content, it must be backed by cold hard facts. You cannot take a controversial stance if you don&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on. Granted that you do backup your claims, it gives your company the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge and authority. With the facts laid out, even those that disagree with your view know you have done your due diligence. Knowledge is still power, and brands need to cash in.</p><p> When producing content that inspires controversy, it is critical to find a proper balance and fully understand that some topics just should not be remarked upon. Use a discerning eye towards topics that you can capitalize on and what may backfire. Granted that you can distinguish between the two, controversial content can be a massive force in boosting sales, engagement, traffic, and overall awareness.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 16:15:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 16:15:15.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_oguMCvP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/take-a-controversial-stance-from-time-to-time-its-good-for-business/\", \"post_id\": \"12551\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 16:15:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 16:15:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"take-a-controversial-stance-from-time-to-time-its-good-for-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12550\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6099\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/take-controversial-stance-time-time-its-good-business.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"733\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468918800,"author_id":484,"chart_url":""}

The services they valued the most were:</p><li> Sales and Marketing 56.8%</li><li> Client Service 52.1%</li><li> Operations and technology 44.2%</li><li> Business services 42.9%</li><h3> Relationships are key <br/>  </h3><p> Practice Management is critically (and increasingly) important to the relationship between advisors and the institutions they work with. Practice Management themes include: Service, Efficient, Process, Time, and Financial Planning. Advisors want advice and best practices tailored to their needs and want someone to assist them in implementing improvements.</p><p> Financial Advisors said they will devote significant new investment dollars to sales and marketing, while advisor time spent is most weighted to client service. Practice management is becoming a critical part of the value proposition and firms are budgeting significantly to improve their practice management offerings to advisors. Practice management remains an immature area without clearly defined goals, budgets, staff and agreed-upon methods to measure the effectiveness of practice management programs. While almost all firms try to offer advisors help in any area they can, there is a need for specialization in terms of focus on specific areas of assistance. Most institutions currently deliver robust platform capabilities. Future differentiation will depend on their ability to help advisors leverage those existing capabilities versus simply developing more capabilities.</p><h3> Five keys revealed from the AdvisorOne/ActiFi Pursuing Practice Excellence practice management study, 2012: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Practice Management is a relationship <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s clear that practice management is critically important to the relationship between advisors and the institutions that serve them and will become increasingly so. It&rsquo;s obvious why so many firms are investing in practice management, with two-thirds of advisors saying it&rsquo;s critical to their relationship with their partners.</p><h3> 2. Define it <br/>  </h3><p> The definition of practice management is broad and varied, yet key themes emerge: service, efficient, process, time, and financial. However, advisors rank sales and marketing as the highest need. So there is an opportunity to expand the advisor&rsquo;s definition of practice management to include sales and marketing.</p><h3> 3. Several areas <br/>  </h3><p> While sales and marketing is the individual sector that scored significantly higher than any other area in which advisors said they most needed help, all areas scored highly with even the lowest (operations and technology) hitting almost 40%.</p><h3> 4. Assist in implementation <br/>  </h3><p> While there are a wide variety of methods to deliver practice management services, advisors want advice and best practices tailored to their needs and want someone to assist them in implementing improvements.</p><h3> 5. Client Service <br/>  </h3><p> Time Management Advisors said they will devote significant new investment dollars to sales and marketing, while advisor time spent is most weighted to client service.</p><h3> The most important goal <br/>  </h3><p> If nothing else changes and we carry on with business today, what is the one main goal of practice management that can make a difference? One thing executed above everything else that will make a difference, is coaching (training). Coaching advisors to &ldquo;implement key practice management processes into their business.&rdquo;</p><p> This is the one idea that is similar to when John F. Kennedy said, &ldquo;Land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth before this decade is out.&rdquo;</p><p> What are we trying to do? It is not several goals and programs, its one main goal. Until organizations and advisors figure out that in practice management, the goal is coaching and training, we can design create and implement concepts, solutions and ideas until the cows come home.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Ask the top financial advisors in the industry in North America and the top 5% will have utilized some type of coaching to achieve their success. Without coaching and training, practice management is just a basket of ideas and concepts.</p><p> Just like coaching a hockey team. The goal is to prepare to play your system consistently, execute your system without compromise over and over from defense to offense until the other team makes a mistake or you score a goal. The goal is not to just score a ton of goals; the goal is to execute the systems repeatedly over and over, better than any other team (or advisor).</p><p> The legendary basketball Bobby Knight had a couple of great quotes that help capture the essence of coaching. Bobby Knight said:</p><p> &ldquo;Most people have the will to win, few have the will to prepare to win.&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t play against opponents, you play against the game of basketball.&rdquo; &ldquo;From a coaching standpoint, the greatest fear I&rsquo;ve ever had - and it doesn&rsquo;t take a Final Four to bring it out - is that in some way I might not have prepared my team as well as I could have.&rdquo;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 16:32:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 16:32:09.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_7YmG9od.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-best-measure-practice-management-success-for-financial-advisors/\", \"post_id\": \"12555\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 16:32:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 16:32:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-best-measure-practice-management-success-for-financial-advisors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12554\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6101\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-best-measure-practice-management-success-financial-advisors.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1155\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468915200,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

She has been on the road more than ever, it seems. Yeah &ndash; I chuckle and empathize. When I look at the pace of my life over the last 6 weeks I think to myself come on, really? Like, REALLY?</p><h3> We need to relearn the slow-down lessons again and again. Don&rsquo;t think of this as summertime. Consider it summer slow-down time.</h3><p> <br/> When I lived in Manhattan, many firms switched to summertime hours. Short Fridays, long week-ends. When I lived in Trinidad and Tobago, it was summertime 365 days a year. You slow down.</p><p> The weather knows. The body knows. We think we know better. Many of us slow down the second we exit a building, switch back to rush-rush mode the moment we&rsquo;re back inside. Consider this one of the gifts of the summer heat: Experiment with slowing down even when the air-conditioning says  go ahead, keep rushing . Experience some of the subtle benefits of slowed-down time:</p><li> <strong>  Slower Walks </strong> <br/> As you stroll down the office hallway to a meeting room or kitchenette, walk slower than you normally might. Less briskly, more calmly. You will be more keenly aware of the space around you. Less in your thoughts, more in the physical environment. You will suddenly feel considerably more alert. And that feels really nice!</li><li> <strong>  Slower Speech </strong> <br/> Regardless of your regular speech rhythm, have some fun slowing down your speaking pace. This may mean actually speaking more slowly. Pausing a bit longer. Chances are, what you say will resonate more strongly with your conversation partner. Individual words will pop. Your pauses will allow for deeper absorption by the other party. The entire conversation will settle into a more purposeful exchange. That feels nice, too!</li><li> <strong>  Slower Breath </strong> <br/> You likely don&rsquo;t pay attention to your breath during a regular day. Understood. Pause once in a while for 20, 30 seconds. Observe your breath. Slow down and lengthen your inhale, your exhale. Then return to the task you are performing, the phone call you are about to make. As your breath slows down, you heighten your enjoyment of the activity you perform. Yup, really nice.</li><li> <strong>  Single Tasks </strong> <br/> We know you can multi-task. You get things done. Chances are, by the end of the day you may not remember some of what you did. You had a highly efficient and regrettably unmemorable day. Choose to remember what you&rsquo;re doing as you&rsquo;re doing it. Because it actually takes time the day after to recall all the details that you forgot. And that&rsquo;s less nice. <br/>  </li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Surrender to summer slow-down time, not just in the outdoor mid-July heat. As you slow down, you will more vibrantly experience each aspect of your day. You will fritter away less time. You will be more mindful of each moment. </p><h3> It&rsquo;s the slow-down paradox. We actually get more done.</h3><p> <br/> Very nice indeed.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 16:32:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 16:32:39.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_VGlBgfv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-ways-to-slow-down-for-peak-personal-impact/\", \"post_id\": \"12557\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 16:32:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 16:32:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-ways-to-slow-down-for-peak-personal-impact\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12556\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6102\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/4-ways-slow-down-peak-personal-impact.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"632\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468947600,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5856,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why All Great Leaders Need to Possess Emotional Intelligence","link":"why-all-great-leaders-need-to-possess-emotional-intelligence","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Anyone who&rsquo;s ever been employed can tell you how stressful even the most enjoyable job can get from time to time. <br/>  </h3><p> Without proper leadership, many different personalities housed under the same roof can cause serious problems that can pollute company culture &mdash; even if everyone is more or less working toward the same goal.</p><p> For this reason, it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly apparent that &mdash; aside from the relevant work prowess and skill sets they need to be effective &mdash; today&rsquo;s great leaders also need to possess high EQ (emotional intelligence).</p><p> According to Psychology Today, emotional intelligence is the sum of three unique characteristics:</p><li> The ability to be aware of your own emotions as well as the emotions of those around you</li><li> The ability to apply emotions to thinking and problem-solving</li><li> The ability to manage emotions internally and externally <br/>  </li><p> Those who possess a high level of emotional intelligence better understand what makes people tick. In a workplace setting &mdash; where a routine day can become chaotic in a couple of minutes &mdash; this is particularly important. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><h3> 1. Those with emotional intelligence possess self-awareness <br/>  </h3><p> Imagine everyone&rsquo;s day is less than optimal. The quarter&rsquo;s winding down, and everyone is scrambling to meet quotas and deadlines.</p><p> Now, let&rsquo;s say a manager gets some bad news about something coming down the pipeline six months from now. If that person were to share the news with their team right away, things could get ugly &mdash; and fast.</p><p> Emotional intelligence allows people to be aware of themselves and how their behaviors and actions can affect other people &mdash; for better and for worse. While a leader who lacks emotional intelligence might be quick to inform their team about the bad news, the leader who&rsquo;s extremely emotionally intelligent knows they can wait to share the news until the office quiets down and workflows return to normal.</p><h3> 2. Great leaders are able to keep their emotions in check <br/>  </h3><p> Because leaders that possess emotional intelligence are aware of how they can rub off on their employees, they understand that they should never let their emotions get the best of them. And this is important because just one uncalled-for outburst can severely damage team morale.</p><p> Instead of being driven by their emotions, great leaders keep them in check. When they are having a bad day, they don&rsquo;t take it out on their staffs. On the flip side, when their teams are having a bad day and are incredibly stressed, they don&rsquo;t go bragging about how great everything is and how happy they are to not have to be doing the grunt work.</p><h3> 3. They are also able to put themselves in their employees&rsquo; shoes <br/>  </h3><p> The leader who lacks emotional intelligence has no problem dumping even more tasks on their employees&rsquo; plates &mdash; even though 70% of them already feel overworked. This leader doesn&rsquo;t even think about what adding more work to an increasingly pile does to the morale of their staff because they are simply unable to put themselves in their employees&rsquo; shoes.</p><p> On the other hand, emotional intelligence goes hand in hand with empathy. Leaders who are emotionally intelligent can easily assess whether their teams are happy and motivated or miserable and lacking energy.</p><p> If a leader senses their staff falls into the former category, they may very well decide it&rsquo;s time to launch a new initiative, which may in fact add more work to their plates. But if the same leader senses the staff falls into the latter category, they will start brainstorming ways to improve morale before dumping more work on them.</p><h3> 4. Understanding emotions allows leaders to communicate more effectively <br/>  </h3><p> Leadership and communication go hand in hand. Leaders can&rsquo;t expect their employees to do things a certain way if they&rsquo;re unable to clearly communicate what they have in mind. Being an effective communicator requires a firm understanding of language and the ability to write or speak in a clear and concise manner. But it also requires an understanding of the audience they&rsquo;re speaking to &mdash; which includes how those folks may be feeling at any particular point in time.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Emotionally intelligent leaders have their fingers on the pulse of their employees&rsquo; emotions. They also understand how their own emotions affect themselves at any given point in time. Altogether, this translates into the reality that leaders with emotional intelligence are able to communicate effectively in virtually all situations. They understand the appropriate times certain news items should be shared. They also understand appropriate venues to hold meetings at and the right tones to use to convey their thoughts.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> An emotionally intelligent leader, for example, knows they shouldn&rsquo;t publicly criticize an employee in an open-office setting two days after that person&rsquo;s family member passed away. The leader understands it&rsquo;s more appropriate to wait a week or two to discuss areas that need improvement in a much more private setting.</p><h3> How to Boost Emotional Intelligence <br/>  </h3><p> Are you confident in your emotional intelligence? If not, don&rsquo;t sweat it. Here are some tricks you can use to enhance your EQ:</p><li> Use the pronoun we: To a certain extent, everyone is interested in themselves &mdash; particularly in the work environment. We want more money, more congratulations, and more responsibility. Emotionally intelligent leaders understand they have already climbed to the top of the ladder. They direct more of their focus on the group than they do themselves.</li><li> Increase face-to-face time: We are social creatures. Though technology has made it easier than ever to communicate via digital text, nothing trumps actual face-to-face time. Whenever possible, speak to your team in the flesh. That&rsquo;s what makes us human.</li><li> Ask more questions: Leaders who talk down to their employees and rarely, if ever, solicit ideas from them are unlikely to produce great results. Ask your employees for their opinions on important things to prove you are involving them in the process and care about their concerns.</li><li> Listen when employees talk: It&rsquo;s not enough to ask questions. Most importantly, you need to actually listen to what your workers are telling you. That makes it easier to put yourself in their shoes and understand where they are coming from.</li><p> It may take some time to enhance your emotional intelligence, but it&rsquo;s one of those leadership qualities that not every person possesses. And the work you put in will most certainly pay dividends down the road. Not only will you become a better manager, but your employees will be happier &mdash; and your bottom line will reflect it. </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 16:47:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 16:47:43.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_xkb5AgL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-all-great-leaders-need-to-possess-emotional-intelligence/\", \"post_id\": \"12559\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 16:47:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 16:47:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-all-great-leaders-need-to-possess-emotional-intelligence\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12558\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6103\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-all-great-leaders-need-possess-emotional-intelligence.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"852\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468954800,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5857,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The 5 Essential Skills for Influential Advice","link":"the-5-essential-skills-for-influential-advice","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The financial adviser is  <strong>  supposed to be an influencer </strong> &hellip;our purpose is to influence others to make better decisions than they would otherwise have made.</p><p> In order to become a more  effective  adviser the ongoing development of the skills that are required to deliver influential advice should be deliberately developed.  But what are the essential skills that lead to influence for an adviser in today&rsquo;s world of fast-moving, mobile-search-driven, value-conscious consumers?</p><p> I believe there are 5 essentials, and they are:</p><h3> 1.  THE number 1 skill today is  <strong>  reputation management  . </strong></h3><p> <br/> This about building, developing and promoting a great personal brand.   Every advisers&rsquo; professional reputation is their brand, and it follows that each adviser today must be great at being their own reputation manager. It cannot be contracted out to a PR firm or marketing manager, and it cannot be ignored.  Everything you do in the real world or online today adds to or detracts from your brand&hellip;your personal reputation.  It must be managed well if you want to be able to influence others.</p><p> The media carries examples every week of a business person, or celebrity, or sports-person, or politician, who has engaged in an incredibly thoughtless and stupid pronouncement in real time on Twitter or LinkedIn. It is no different for any financial adviser, although our spheres of influence are often much much smaller than the high profile examples.  Mis-management of a reputation or personal brand can occur today in just 140 characters&hellip;.vigilance and continual development of skill in this area is critical.</p><h3> 2.  The second of the key skills is managing  <strong>  transparency </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> Transparency is not just about the compliance aspects of revealing costs, fees or conflicts of interest.  Building trust through transparency is not triggered by customer request or a law&hellip;creating trust through transparency it is an attitude.   It is about understanding and pre-empting the unasked questions that todays consumers have, and then proactively answering them without the consumer having to ask the awkward questions openly.</p><p> Transparency is also about being personable and open as a human being&hellip;.being able to connect to other humans at an emotional level is essential for building any relationship, including a robust and valued advice relationship.  Transparency is open-ness: being open professionally, and being open as a person, so potential clients can genuinely get to know and trust the adviser.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 3.  An essential skills which scares many advisers is the concept of &ldquo; <strong>  Persuasiveness&rdquo; </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> Persuasiveness is not just about &ldquo;selling ability&rdquo; &ndash; it is the ability to shape thinking and coach change of behaviour in others.</p><p> Being persuasive does involve being a salesperson  as well as  a coach  as well as  a great facilitator.  Being able to influence clients to react positively to new information and strategies, and to change behaviour and attitudes requires all of the skills of all 3 of those roles &ndash; selling, coaching, &amp; facilitating.  Only then can a professional be completely equipped to create the necessary positive changes that clients need.  The ability to persuade others to change course is a critical skill too.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 4.  It is positively Darwinian: advisers must be  <strong>  adaptable. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Adjust and adapt quickly in order to survive and thrive in a rapidly changing world&hellip;learn how to do it, or die commercially. That is the reality today.</p><p> Embracing new thinking, new technology, new professional standards, new research, new trends in behaviour or society&hellip;.&rdquo;new&rdquo; things are the new normality.  Change will not stop.  Change will only accelerate.</p><p> Adaptability is the key to thriving in the new normal.</p><h3> 5.  The final essential skill is being  <strong>  perceptive. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Perceptive means understanding intuitively&hellip;without necessarily needing an explanation.   Understanding what is not being said is just as important today as understanding what is being said.   Determining motives and attitudes and personality traits and drivers of behaviour&hellip;without needing a 40 page fact-finding document to remind you of the questions that lead to a limited form of perception is a highly developed skill.</p><p> Questionnaires and compliance tools will only ever go so far in helping an adviser to understand a client.  They are helpful&hellip;..but the adviser is the part that captures that which is not said or stated overtly by consumers, and it is often the unspoken thoughts which are most influential.  The advisers ability to perceive those things is one of the keys to being an effective influencer with consumers.</p><p> The advisers who will thrive in the rapidly changing professional world will of course have strong technical competencies and knowledge, as will those who merely survive.  The difference between the survivors and thrivers is the development of the soft skills which help influence change in others.</p><p> That is the advisers role of course, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 16:53:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 16:53:26.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_laK8l64.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-5-essential-skills-for-influential-advice/\", \"post_id\": \"12561\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 16:53:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 16:53:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-5-essential-skills-for-influential-advice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12560\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6104\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-essential-skills-influential-advice.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"989\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468915200,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

Keep pen and paper handy at all times <br/>  </h3><p> The idea toolkit is simple: all you need is an open mind, a pen and some paper. We know that mobile devices are just as good as pen and paper but, from our experience, these &ldquo;old school&rdquo; tools help us to log our ideas, and also help to spark more ideas once we get writing.</p><p> Whatever your approach, make sure you are able to record your ideas at all times and in any location.</p><h3> 2. Move your body, clear your head <br/>  </h3><p> The irony of great of ideas is that they often pop up when you&rsquo;re not trying to find great ideas. If you&rsquo;re in a jam and stuck for ideas, get moving. Exercising &ndash; like simply going for a walk &ndash; can provide well-needed creative fuel.</p><h3> 3. Cast a wide net <br/>  </h3><p> Get everybody participating in idea generation. The best ideas often come from unexpected sources. Try setting up quick meetings, hosting one-off brainstorming sessions and sending unexpected emails to anybody willing to participate. <br/> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. See the trends <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re looking for great ideas for your business, you&rsquo;ll want to keep an eye on trends. Business success often depends on determining what people want today and what they&rsquo;ll want tomorrow &ndash; and then delivering on these preferences.</p><p> To get there, you&rsquo;ll need to be on the leading edge. You can start by listening to what your clients and prospects are saying on social media.</p><h3> 5. Test the water <br/>  </h3><p> Just because you think it&rsquo;s a good idea, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it is. Put your ideas to the test by getting your colleagues to review them. Be prepared for some honest &ndash; and occasionally painful &ndash; feedback!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 16:57:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 16:57:13.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_jI6iT0H.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-easy-ways-to-generate-more-great-business-ideas/\", \"post_id\": \"12563\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 16:57:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 16:57:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-easy-ways-to-generate-more-great-business-ideas\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12562\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6105\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/five-easy-ways-generate-more-great-business-ideas.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"308\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468951200,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5859,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Sad Reality Is That Very Few People Plan Ahead for LTC","link":"the-sad-reality-is-that-very-few-people-plan-ahead-for-ltc","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you've ever visited someone in a nursing home, chances are you walked out afterward vowing, \"I'm never going to end up in a place like this.\"</p><p> That vow is one most of us would make. Keeping it, however, is another matter. Let's consider some facts. What are the odds you will live the last years of your life in a skilled care facility (nursing or assisted living home)?</p><p> About 14 percent of all people over age 64 have two to three chronic conditions that negate their ability to live independently. <a href=\"http://nursinghomediaries.com/howmany/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census </a> , 5 percent of people over age 65 live in nursing or assisted living homes and 25 percent of them will spend some time in one. The chance of a stay in a nursing home increases 1.4 percent a year from age 65 on. Almost 50 percent of those over age 95 live in nursing homes.</p><p> While staying in the comforting surroundings of our homes is what most of us would prefer, just saying so isn&rsquo;t going to make it happen. Unless you have a written plan and the finances to carry out that plan, the chances are high you will not be able to afford living in your home once you need daily assistance of some type.</p><p> The problem is that spending your last years in a nursing home is expensive, too. At rates of around $7,000 to $12,000 a month, it is very easy to spend $250,000 or more during the last years of one&rsquo;s life. While this is doable if you have the money, it becomes a financial disaster if you have a spouse and spend through your estate in your last years. In this case, the first one to die wins at the expense of the survivor.</p><p> According to the U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/01/26/the-average-americans-net-worth-by-age-heres-where.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  70 percent of Americans age 65 and over have a household net worth of just $344,870 </a> . If one spouse enters a skilled care facility there is a real threat that the other will run out of money to fund living expenses, relying only on Social Security.</p><p> Once someone's assets are spent down, Medicaid will begin paying for nursing home costs. This may mean changes such as moving to a facility that accepts Medicaid and out of a private room into a shared room. It also may mean waiting for a bed to become available.</p><p> The \"short version\" of the law is that Medicaid begins paying once assets are spent down to $2000. However, there are provisions meant to protect the non-institutionalized spouse from destitution. <a href=\"http://www.elderlawanswers.com/medicaid-protections-for-the-healthy-spouse-12019\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Some of the couple's assets are exempt </a> from being spent down for nursing home care.</p><p> In South Dakota, for example, the spouse may keep half of the combined assets up to $119,220. Other exempt assets generally include personal possessions, one vehicle, equity up to $552,000 in the couple's personal residence, prepaid funeral plans, and assets that are considered \"inaccessible\". There are also limits on monthly income from pensions. The numbers above are for South Dakota; all of these limits vary by state so be sure to research your own state's laws.</p><p> Obviously, planning for long term care is vitally important, and it needs to be done well before the event that sends someone to a skilled care facility. Unfortunately, those events are often sudden and impossible to predict. The sad reality is that very few people plan ahead&mdash;even those who do financial planning in other areas. Many elders have a deep resistance to doing end-of-life planning. That is sad, because the less planning you do, the more limited your options become.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-18 17:08:19.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-18 17:08:19.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_vQDowrF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-sad-reality-is-that-very-few-people-plan-ahead-for-ltc/\", \"post_id\": \"12565\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-18 17:08:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-18 17:08:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-sad-reality-is-that-very-few-people-plan-ahead-for-ltc\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12564\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6106\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sad-reality-very-few-people-plan-ahead-ltc_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1014\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468929600,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5860,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Simple Ways to Improve Your Website","link":"10-simple-ways-to-improve-your-website","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Is your website driving new business into your firm? The key with powerful websites isn&rsquo;t so much what they look like, but what the visitors do when they arrive. Here are a few quick tips for fixing your website and driving more qualified prospects to you from your website.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Simplify Navigation </strong></h3><p> <br/> Focus on having simple navigation that will take people from your home page to exactly where you want them to go. Most visitors will go to 1.3 pages on a website (including your home page) with the 2nd most popular place being the About Us page (they really want to know who you are). What else do you want them to see? Establish links driving visitors to other interesting information inside your site.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Target Highest Common Denominator </strong></h3><p> <br/> Focus your messaging on the best, highest common denominator prospect, not everyone. Using this strategy will avoid targeting your messaging to everyone. No one wants to know you can work with everyone &ndash; they only want to know you can work with them. Who do you really want to attract?</p><h3> <strong>  3. Authentic Pictures </strong></h3><p> <br/> Use pictures of actual people that work in your office. Marketing Experiments performed a test comparing the use of stock photography verses real imagery on a website and each of their effects on lead generation. What they found was that photos of real people out-performed the stock photos by 95%. Why? Because stock images tend to be irrelevant. Resist the temptation to use photos of fake smiling business people!</p><h3> <strong>  4. Improve Your &ldquo;About Us&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> The biggest mistake made in marketing &mdash; and a reason that success can be so elusive&mdash; is to not clearly explain who you are and what you offer to your prospects, clients and potential referral sources. Answer three questions to write one About Us paragraph describing what your firm does&hellip; What do you do? Who do you work with? What is interesting about what your firm does?</p><h3> <strong>  5. Short, Concise Messaging </strong></h3><p> <br/> Reduce your website messaging so it is short, concise and directed to your target market. Assume that people don&rsquo;t want to read. Substitute a lot of words with enticing headlines informing of the words below that you want them to read. If you have more than a couple paragraphs of verbiage on each page, it is probably too much (bio&rsquo;s excluded).</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  6. One Theme </strong></h3><p> <br/> What is the ONE thing you want people to know about you? Make sure the takeaway that you want visitors to have is a theme running through your website. It could be Trust, Target Market Focus, Your Team, Specialized Knowledge, Local Expertise, etc.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Call to Action </strong></h3><p> <br/> Add a call to action to engage your visitors to obtain value, find out more, or contact you. Develop an offer of a report, whitepaper or webinar that would be of value to your target market. Entice visitors to do something to move their interest in you forward.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Video </strong></h3><p> <br/> Adding video can grab attention and increase credibility. Using video on your website allows you to demonstrate the significance of your services. You can even mix the videos up and have staff explain service information, as well as answer questions. All of this brings increased credibility to you and your firm.</p><h3> <strong>  9. Improve Bios </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your bio should provide the inspiration they need to hire you and your team. To improve your bio (which if they are interested in coming in to see you WILL be viewed) then think about answering 4 questions in 4 paragraphs or maybe more (your bio is one instance where more messaging is better)&hellip; What do you do for clients? Why are you in this business? What is your background and experience? What do you like to do when not in the office?</p><h3> <strong>  10. Start With Words, Not Design </strong></h3><p> <br/> It is easy to get drawn into having an exciting new design for your website. However, the words you use to describe your business will make a significant difference in the overall impact of your website. If you want people to act after coming to your website, give them the right, compelling words that will get them increasingly interested. Then, after you finish writing the messaging for your site, think about your powerful design.</p><p> Quick fixes may not transform your entire website, but they certainly will help make your website and home page more enticing. Watch your analytics WEEKLY so you can see what is and isn&rsquo;t working. It is the only way you can really utilize your website as your most powerful marketing tool.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-19 13:05:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-19 13:05:44.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_N6alqVC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-simple-ways-to-improve-your-website/\", \"post_id\": \"12567\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-19 13:05:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-19 13:05:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-simple-ways-to-improve-your-website\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12566\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6108\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/10-simple-ways-improve-your-website.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"537\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469008800,"author_id":322,"chart_url":""}

Although the rule is long and convoluted--clocking it at over 600 pages--the simple answer is this: if you offer any type of retirement advice, this law applies to you. This includes advisors offering advice to groups (i.e. an employer-sponsored retirement plan) and individuals. Individuals include plan participants and IRA owners.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Retirement-planning advice doesn&rsquo;t cover   everything  . </strong></h3><p> <br/> Lawmakers wanted to ensure that the new rule wouldn&rsquo;t stop advisors from providing educational services. So advisors don&rsquo;t have to maintain a fiduciary standard when providing general education on retirement saving. This includes things like newsletters, presentations, marketing materials, and any other information not considered a &ldquo;recommendation.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  4. It doesn&rsquo;t change the commission advisors can earn, but does require a commission disclosure. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Originally, some advisors were concerned that the new rule would affect their ability to make a commission on proprietary products. While this law may make it more difficult to sell commission-based products (since all advisors must meet the fiduciary standard), it doesn&rsquo;t ban commissions. In order to sell clients commission-based products, all advisors must do is have clients sign a disclosure, called the Best Interest Contract Exemption (BICE).</p><h3> <strong>  5. Prospects don&rsquo;t have to sign a disclosure immediately. </strong></h3><p> <br/> When the initial bill was proposed in April, 2015 many advisors feared that the BICE would scare away prospects. Luckily, law-makers took this concern into consideration and changed the rule so that prospects don't have to sign a BICE until they receive account-opening materials.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  6. Current clients don&rsquo;t need to sign a new contract. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re worried that signing new disclosures may send your current clients running, fear not. The DOL decided that an email notifying clients of the changes would suffice. There&rsquo;s no need to have current clients resign anything!</p><h3> <strong>  7. It won&rsquo;t have a huge impact on RIAs. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Since RIAs already act as fiduciaries, they won&rsquo;t face much change in the wake of the new rule. In fact, most RIAs will only have to implement small operational changes in order to remain compliant under the new rule. RIAs will need to make changes to their policies and procedures, adjust client agreement documents, and provide additional disclosures in account-opening materials in order to be compliant with the new law.</p><h3> <strong>  8. It could still cause some problems for RIAs. </strong></h3><p> <br/> While RIAs may be have dodged a bullet in terms of large-scale compliance changes, they could experience other adverse effects. Namely, a large influx of competitors due to the stricter regulations. Many brokers who don&rsquo;t want to use the BICE will become RIAs in order to avoid the strict regulations.</p><h3> <strong>  9. It will drive the shift towards fee-based billing. </strong></h3><p> <br/> While there already has been an ongoing shift towards fee-based billing, the DOL&rsquo;s new rule will further push the industry in this direction. Because comission-based sales will require a BICE, many advisors will transition to a fee-based model.</p><h3> <strong>  10. A paperwork trail will be more necessary now than ever before. </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the biggest changes resulting for the rule will be the amount of paperwork advisors are required to do. The new fiduciary standard puts advisors in a position for potential liability. In order to prove each decision made was made within the client&rsquo;s best interest, it&rsquo;s important to keep accurate records and sufficient paperwork. This will help advisors avoid a lawsuit if the market takes an unexpected downturn.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-19 14:12:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-19 14:12:07.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_vG9ESLX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-dols-new-rule/\", \"post_id\": \"12569\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-19 14:12:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-19 14:12:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-dols-new-rule\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12568\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6109\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-dols-new-rule.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"702\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469008800,"author_id":90,"chart_url":""}

I get that.</p><h3> But even if you&rsquo;re not currently in the Twitterverse, stay with me for a moment.</h3><p> <br/> Because there is something for your business in Twitter if any of these statements are true:</p><p> <strong>  Your sweet-spot prospects are there. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Your referral sources are there. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Your competition is there. </strong></p><p> Your smallest&mdash;but still not insignificant&mdash;value from Twitter is simply being able to listen to the conversations relevant to your expertise. All it requires is creating an account, following those that matter to you and checking in regularly to see what&rsquo;s cooking. If you&rsquo;re not already doing this, seriously, start now.</p><p> <strong>  But where you can make Twitter priceless is when you fully harness its power to bring you one of the big three: clients, media coverage or book/digital product sales. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Clients.  </strong> This is the big kahuna. If you already have demonstrated expertise and a robust business model, you may well be sitting on tens of thousands of dollars (or more). I&rsquo;m living proof&mdash;Twitter has directly led to over $300,000 in revenue (and indirectly to much more).</p><p> How Twitter works for YOU depends heavily on to whom you sell and how you price and deliver your services and products. But with so much revenue at stake, shouldn&rsquo;t you explore its potential? One of my clients wasn&rsquo;t convinced Twitter would work for him after he&rsquo;d played with it for a few months. I convinced him to make three changes: his handle, his profile and proactively following his sweet-spot potential clients. Boo ya&mdash;two weeks later he had his first Twitter client.</p><p> For more details on the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of building your platform via Twitter,  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/using-twitter-to-build-your-platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  check out my video here </a> .  or the article  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/what-works-for-me-on-twitter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;What Works For Me On Twitter&rdquo; here. </a></p><p> <strong>  Media Coverage:  </strong> Maybe you can&rsquo;t afford $5,000 and up a month to get yourself a PR team to promote you or your new book. Or you&rsquo;ve been burned before and just don&rsquo;t want to go there again. Why not start building your own organic media coverage right now? It&rsquo;s easier than you think on Twitter.</p><p> Fact #1: Every major and minor journalist, as well as influential bloggers of all persuasions, is actively using Twitter. You can follow them, befriend them (think relentlessly helpful) and ultimately even pitch them. Or they may make it even easier and pitch YOU. Bloggers and podcasters are on constant alert for content and you may just fit the bill.</p><p> Fact #2: Most journalists are juggling multiple stories and impossible deadlines. They appreciate nothing more than the expert who helps them&mdash;quickly, on-point and with no drama.</p><p> If you start building your media network organically right now, then, when you need them (new book, new product, hot story), they will be primed and ready for you.</p><p> <strong>  Book Sales:  </strong> Twitter is to book sales what walnuts are to banana bread. It&rsquo;s not the main ingredient, but it takes the bread up a notch. Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p><p> The single best way to sell books is from your most intimate audience and that&rsquo;s your email list. These are the people who have given you permission to enter the sanctity of their in box. Twitter will get you some direct book sales, but the real magic is in your list.  <strong>  So to sell more books, use Twitter to build your list. </strong>  And not while you&rsquo;re publishing the book, but months before.</p><p> That requires compelling content designed for your audience, regular invites to join your list and seamless integration with your website sign-up.</p><p> There&rsquo;s another group that&rsquo;s critical to your book sales&mdash;what I call your &ldquo;Circle&rdquo;. These are the people who will read advance copies of the book and post reviews, serve as endorsers and/or put out the word to THEIR audiences. A solid book launch needs about 100 Circle members, and more is generally better.</p><h3> Use Twitter to organically connect with your future Circle over time and when your book or products are ready&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got built in apostles to spread the word.</h3><p> <br/> The bottom line is this: take a good hard look at what Twitter is worth to you right now.

{"original_id":5863,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Social Shutout: How Women Can Direct a Business Conversation Away From Sports","link":"the-social-shutout-how-women-can-direct-a-business-conversation-away-from-sports","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> When delivering workshops about business networking, an inquiry that I often get from the female participants is, &ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t do sports?&rdquo;.</h3><p> <br/> In other words, since they don&rsquo;t follow college or professional sports, how can these women find a small talk entry point when the conversation takes that direction? You see, the professional services sector is still predominantly men, leaving us women in the minority at networking events, and setting the stage for football, hockey and other male-dominated topicality to quickly become the default conversational theme. And once it goes there, we feel like we&rsquo;re growing smaller and smaller, as the men settle into the conversation in quite the way they would settle into an armchair to watch the game.</p><p> Whether they realize it or not, men are actively shutting women out of business opportunities when they choose not to be mindful about gender neutrality in the small talk they engage in. This is not likely to change either, which means that businesswomen need to find creative ways to redirect the conversation and get noticed. When I head out to a networking event, I&rsquo;m armed with conversation-directing techniques for almost any sports scenario that gets pitched my way. Here are some useful ways for YOU to turn sports chat into a game where everyone wins.</p><h3> <strong>  The Eyes Have It </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you find yourself engaged with a group in conversation, and the sports chat takes hold, check out all of the eyes. The odds are you&rsquo;ll find the one man who doesn&rsquo;t like sports. He&rsquo;ll be the one with that glazed-over look in his eyes, perhaps even a little disengaged or uncomfortable. Begin a separate conversation with him, and you&rsquo;re off-and-running.</p><h3> <strong>  Not From Around Here? </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you discover that one of the men is speaking about a favorite team that isn&rsquo;t a local one, often this means it&rsquo;s his hometown team. This is your cue to slant the conversation to where he grew up. If it turns out you were wrong, there may still be an interesting story behind the reason it&rsquo;s his favorite team. Inquire about it, and get him talking to you. Once you have his attention, you&rsquo;re in control of where the conversation turns to business.</p><h3> <strong>  Stay Indirectly On-Topic </strong></h3><p> <br/> Realize that many sports fans enjoy being athletic themselves, and use this to your advantage in steering the conversation. Tell him that you&rsquo;re not much of a sports spectator, but that you like rowing, biking, hiking, rock climbing, skiing&hellip;.whatever your athletic interests happen to be. Then ask him about his favorite athletic activities. This can be a clever way to redirect the conversation to related topics like travel and dining. Now the sports are out of the picture, and authentic networking can begin.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  Know What   They   Know </strong></h3><p> <br/> To connect with businessmen who are preoccupied with professional sports, you don&rsquo;t need to be a sports buff yourself. Simply scan the Mets &amp; Yankees (or Giants &amp; Jets) box scores every few days, just to gain a sense of what&rsquo;s going on. It also goes a long way to be privy to who&rsquo;s having great seasons in the major sporting leagues (baseball, football, basketball). By not remaining totally ignorant, you can earn yourself entry into most sports conversations without committing more than a few minutes each week to research.</p><h3> <strong>  Once You&rsquo;re On Base </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you&rsquo;ve managed to penetrate the sports talk and convert strangers into business contacts, be sure to notate their key sports preferences, especially if they are obsessive. This will provide you with things to say to them each time you see them in the future. You can also be thoughtfully clever by sending them a note when their team makes the playoffs! But remember: This is not to be taken as an opening to talk about your kid&rsquo;s little league team and how amazing she is. Every mother thinks her kid is amazing. Your job is to make your new contact feel remembered, and to feel proud of yourself for accomplishing what so many women in business were stumped by!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-19 14:32:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-19 14:32:17.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_4hsbakx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-social-shutout-how-women-can-direct-a-business-conversation-away-from-sports/\", \"post_id\": \"12573\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-19 14:32:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-19 14:32:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-social-shutout-how-women-can-direct-a-business-conversation-away-from-sports\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12572\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6111\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/social-shutout-how-women-can-direct-business-conversation-away-sports.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"623\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469012400,"author_id":135,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5864,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"13 FBI Principles of Mental Toughness","link":"13-fbi-principles-of-mental-toughness","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I get quite a few chuckles from people who write about mental toughness when all they have to cite are statistics that come from other people&rsquo;s experiences. Rare is the person who writes about how to be mentally strong from personal experience.</h3><p> <br/> When I interviewed to become an FBI agent, one of the things that the interviewing panel liked about me was that I was born and raised on a cattle ranch in the middle of Wyoming. I did not grow up pampered and did not see myself as entitled to anything. Instead, I was young, scrappy, and hungry to prove myself worthy of a chance to work hard and climb the ladder of success on my own.</p><p> I did not have parents hovering over me to give me all the advantages that are making today&rsquo;s kids soft, entitled, and ungrateful.</p><p> Search the phrase mental toughness and you&rsquo;re likely to come up with a muck-up of assorted opinions on what it means.</p><p> I have worked hard to identify my core beliefs about mental toughness. Here I share 13 key principles I learned from my time with the FBI:</p><h3> <b>  Principle #1: Self Awareness </b></h3><p> <br/> Unless you know what makes you tick, you&rsquo;ll be forever ignorant about the most important person in your life&mdash;yourself.</p><p> FBI agents must know themselves well enough that they can predict their response when confronted with the unknown.</p><h3> <b>  Principle #2: Awareness of Others </b></h3><p> <br/> Many believe that mental toughness is a leader&rsquo;s ability to plow through emotions and feelings without being touched by them so they can continue to march stalwartly onward. It&rsquo;s not that simple.</p><p> FBI agents are successful investigators because they are able to recognize the negative emotions of others and anticipate how they could spin out of control.</p><h3> <b>  Principle #3: Communication </b></h3><p> <br/> You can have the greatest ideas in the world, but if you can&rsquo;t explain them to others, you will never be anything more than educated derelict.</p><p> FBI agents use interviews as their most reliable and successful investigative tool. Despite what you see in movies and TV, communicating with people and getting them to cooperate is far more effective than extortion or threats.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <b>  Principle #4: Resilience </b></h3><p> <br/> Resilient people are mentally tough because they take responsibility for their actions and do not resort to whining or blaming others for their situation.</p><p> FBI agents are not able to choose their assignments so they learn to be resilient and bounce back from the sticky situations in which they often find themselves.</p><h3> <b>  Principle #5: Authenticity </b></h3><p> <br/> The only time I got into trouble in undercover work as as an FBI agent was when I tried to be someone I am not. I could slap on a different name or title, but if I wanted to be successful I needed to be authentic about who I was.</p><p> I learned this from years as an FBI investigator: It takes courage to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. It&rsquo;s hard to let go of who you think you ought to be in order to be who you really are. What makes your story unique also makes you powerful.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <b>  Principle #6: Confidence </b></h3><p> <br/> The first thing I learned in the FBI Academy is that success would not make me confident; instead, confidence in myself and my abilities would make me successful.

{"original_id":5865,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Here Comes the Sun: When Retained Benefit Settlements Save the Day","link":"here-comes-the-sun-when-retained-benefit-settlements-save-the-day","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The Beatles stopped touring in 1966. Their manager Brian Epstein died in 1967. And the synergy that had brought together the most successful band in history dissipated. They fought over money. And broke up in 1970 &ndash; it was the end of an era. Only the Beatles themselves can possibly understand the complexities, but it was a split that, like most, ended badly. Of course, in the case of the Beatles, the music lives on. (If only all splits could have such a promising and enduring ending.)There is another split that delivers on that promise&mdash;and without the nastiness of breaking up your band. For seniors who own life insurance they are likely to terminate, a Retained Benefit Settlement does the one thing the Beatles could never do: deliver significant financial benefits and peace of mind to seniors. (For traditional settlement options, see <a href=\"/learn/investing-in-life/senior-clients-need-more-income-this-hidden-treasure-may-be-the-solution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Senior Clients Need More Income? This Hidden Treasure May Be the Solution </a> ).</p><h3> Keep Your Life Insurance Policy, Not the Premiums</h3>As an advisor, you know the scenario well. Your senior client has a life insurance policy they no longer want, need, or can afford. In some cases, the client&rsquo;s children are grown, or their assets now negate the need for such a hefty benefit. In others, premiums have skyrocketed, making what was once valuable coverage suddenly too costly. For whatever reason, all too many policies lapse or are surrendered, which can leave the owner with a poor return on years of premium payments. In all these cases, seniors face losing something they still value and often still need: death benefit protection for their loved ones.<h3> Retained Benefit Settlement</h3>A Retained Benefit Settlement is a valuable alternative for those seniors who still want or need their insurance and want to maximize the value of their soon-to-terminate policies. A Retained Benefit Settlement enables policyholders to keep in force a lower, but still desired, level of benefits, without the expense of paying future premiums. It&rsquo;s a tool that can prove extremely valuable to your clients, their beneficiaries, and your practice.<h3> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s how it works: </strong></h3>As an advisor, when your senior client is faced with the lapse or surrender of a policy, you can get their policy appraised for its fair market value. Following an underwriting of the insured and a review of the policy&rsquo;s future premiums, the senior will be presented with the policy&rsquo;s secondary market value &ndash; which can be expressed as both a cash offer to purchase the policy and a Retained Benefit Settlement.The seller can decide between the two offers &ndash; cash settlement vs. Retained Benefit Settlement &ndash; and often they can negotiate something in-between that meets their individual needs. Some sellers try to keep as much life insurance for their beneficiaries as possible; others simply retain a small amount to pay for &ldquo;final expenses.&rdquo; This optionality is ideal for seniors who need to maintain some level of life insurance for their beneficiaries, but want or need to stop paying premiums.<h3> <strong>  Here are a few examples of how people have used Retained Benefit Settlements: </strong></h3><h3> <strong>  Case #1: </strong></h3>Jon held a $1M life policy with a costly premium of over $1,000/month. Forty-two years old with a wife and two children to support, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given a life expectancy of just three years. The burden of his medical expenses was already throwing him into debt. Unable to work and unable to pay the policy premium, it seemed his only option was to surrender the policy&mdash;along with the much needed $1M benefit&mdash;and use the cash value to pay his mounting medical bills. Even in a best-case scenario, he&rsquo;d be lucky if he had enough cash remaining to support his family for the next 36 months, much less provide for them after his death.Using a Retained Benefit Settlement, he was able to paint an entirely different picture for his family&rsquo;s future. The purchasing company agreed to pay the premiums on the policy and let Jon retain $800,000 of the $1 million dollar death benefit, plus the company would pay Jon $25,000 up front to cover his bills. To maximize the benefits to his family, a scheduled benefits reduction was put in place that reduces Jon&rsquo;s portion of the death benefit by $100K for every year the policy remains in force, making the agreement cost-effective for the buyer as well. The arrangement can&rsquo;t extend his life expectancy, but it certainly gives Jon and his family a better quality of life today, and provides for his family for years to come.##TRENDING##<h3> <strong>  Case #2: </strong></h3>Dorothy is 92 years old. A decade ago, her children took over her life insurance premiums to keep her $500K policy in force. But in the past 12 months, the premiums have doubled to $19K/year. Unable to afford the increase, her children contacted the carrier to surrender the policy. The carrier&rsquo;s offer: just $20K.Luckily, her daughter&rsquo;s advisor recommended a Retained Benefit Settlement. Working with a buyer, Dorothy&rsquo;s children were able to keep the policy in force, receive $115K in cash, and retain $15K of the policy benefit to pay for their mother&rsquo;s final expenses.The settlement increased the value of Dorothy&rsquo;s existing policy by five times. What a difference.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> <strong>  Flexibility to Meet Your Clients&rsquo; Needs </strong></h3>While every case is different, the great thing about Retained Benefit Settlements is they&rsquo;re flexible enough to meet a wide variety of client needs. Based on the amount of benefit the seller wants to retain, the buyer makes an offer that includes a cash payment that corresponds to the desired benefit amount. Using a sliding scale, the two parties then work together to make necessary adjustments until an agreement is reached, including adding a scheduled reduction in benefits if required.In a Retained Benefit Settlement, the beneficiaries named by the seller will be designated as &ldquo;irrevocable,&rdquo; meaning the retained benefit amount is held with the insurance carrier, and the carrier pays the benefits to the beneficiaries directly upon the death of the policyholder. Retained Benefit Settlements are a solution for policyholders facing rising premiums, changing needs, and a desire for a flexible solutions to their life insurance needs.<h3> <strong>  Reaching Across Generations </strong></h3>For advisors, Retained Benefit Settlements provide a new opportunity to help clients maximize value from their existing policies. Perhaps even more importantly, they serve as a valuable springboard to work with the next generation and, hopefully, retain family assets for years to come. By introducing Retained Benefit Settlements as a solution, you can instill greater confidence in your clients&rsquo; heirs, leverage unneeded or unwanted products to deliver greater value, and provide a market value solution that meets the changing needs of your most valued clients. It just may be the happiest outcome of a &ldquo;split&rdquo; ever.

He is a brilliant songwriter that writes Americana music.  These Things I&rsquo;ve Come to Know  is a song about a woman and the quirks and qualities that you would only learn about her after spending vast amounts of time with her.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kim-and-mcmurtry.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/></p>Above: My wife, Kim, and the great James McMurtry in Ft Worth, TX.<br/> <p> In the 16 years that I have been a financial planner, I have spent more time thinking, observing, and learning about people and their money than most do in their lifetimes.  I have tried my hand at trading, technical analysis, following gurus and newsletters, and have made every mistake in the book (some more than once).  Here are the things that I have come to know about investing.</p><h3> Amazon, our Cell Phones, and the Internet Have Made us Worse Investors <br/>  </h3><p> I think I was born impatient. I am the guy that will leave a restaurant when there is more than a 20-minute wait and I have been known to walk out of a barber shop when they aren&rsquo;t moving fast enough.  Amazon has helped us all avoid the unpleasantness of driving to a store and searching through hundreds of rows for the obscure item that we want.  We now get disappointed when it takes more than two days to get our gadget magically delivered to our doorstep.  If we want to start reading a book NOW, we can instantly have it downloaded to our Kindles.  I can see a future where we all have 3-D printers at home and instead of waiting for our products, we buy the right to 3-D print them so we can have them immediately.</p><p> Having so many of our wants satisfied immediately has made us even less patient and that makes investing all the more difficult.  Warren Buffett famously said &ldquo;The stock market is a highly efficient mechanism for the transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient.  I have received a few calls in the last month from clients asking why they don&rsquo;t seem to be making money in their investments. I point them to the chart of the ACWI ETF that attempts to track the MSCI All World Index below.  As you can see, global stocks have crashed and recovered three times, but haven&rsquo;t made investors money for two long years.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/acwi-2years.png\" width=\"697\"/></p><p> The impatient investor wants an 8% return every single year and to see a nice rise in their account every single quarter.  The only person that was able to accomplish that was Bernie Madoff and we now know how he did it.  The impatient investor will not be able to stick with a globally diversified portfolio and will move their money at the precise wrong time to a more U.S. centric stock portfolio because it seems to be &ldquo;working&rdquo; better right now.  The impatient investor will abandon a well thought out diversified portfolio and find the one investment &ldquo;guru&rdquo; that advised putting all of your money in the FANG stocks in 2015 and then fortuitously moved 100% of the portfolio to gold miners and emerging markets at the turn of the calendar year.  Eventually this &ldquo;guru&rdquo; will be painfully wrong and the impatient investor will sell his investments for a loss and chase whatever seems to be &ldquo;working&rdquo; again.</p><h3> The World and Markets are Unpredictable <br/>  </h3><p> As I write early on a Saturday morning, it is supposed to be raining.  The weather app on my phone said there was going to be a 60% chance of rain this morning when I went to bed.  When I woke up this morning, it had gone down to a 0% chance.  In 1995 the World Meteorological Organization estimated that the global budget for weather services was about $4 billion and they still can&rsquo;t predict the weather only one day out!</p><p> The Fortune Sellers by William A. Sherden is one of the most influential books I have ever read.  His book covers everything from weathermen to economists to hurricane modeling.  We all want to believe that there is an expert out there that knows what is going to happen. We want to believe that Janet Yellen and the world&rsquo;s central bankers can guide our economy and know what they are doing. The reality is that there are too many variables and the nature of the future is that it largely unpredictibale.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> How did Sony, the maker of the walkman, not see the iPod coming?  How did Kodak invent the digital camera in 1975 and still go bankrupt?  How did the brilliant founder of IBM say &ldquo;I think there is a world market for maybe five computers in 1943&rdquo;?  Next time you want to take action with your portfolio based on a prediction watch this compilation of Ben Bernanke&rsquo;s comments on why we were not in a housing bubble in 2005 and 2006.</p><p> I have followed a lot of gurus over the years that have been trotted out on financial television to be asked what is going to happen to markets over the next few months.  Some of them have been uncannily right for a few years and then out of the blue their streak is over and they start to make bad calls.  It is better to have a well thought out diversified portfolio than to follow the guru of the day&rsquo;s &ldquo;expert predictions.&rdquo;</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Active Management and Stock Pickers <br/>  </h3><p> Let me tell you a dirty secret about the money management industry: it is fairly easy to get licensed to become a stock broker or financial planner.  The hard part is building up your clientele and therefore most training programs are 75% sales training and only 25% actual financial planning.  I had to memorize word for word almost 20 pages of a sales script or I would have been fired from my first job in this business.</p><p> There is also no book, academic study, or special class that financial advisors go to that shows them how to find the next George Soros or David Tepper. Morningstar has built a very large business around rating mutual funds from one to five stars and even they admit &ldquo;The expense ratio is the most proven predictor of future fund returns.&rdquo; Most financial advisors will tell you they chose XYZ mutual fund because of process of the company, the consistency of the style, or the integrity of the manager. The reality is that most funds are chosen by recent performance and later switched out for funds with better recent performance by the advisor or the advisor&rsquo;s fear of losing a client.</p><p> Please take a few minutes to read the first few pages of the most recent  <a href=\"https://us.spindices.com/search/?ContentType=SPIVA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SPIVA&reg; US Report Card </a> . On page five you can see what percentage of U.S. mutual funds underperformed their benchmarks over the last ten years.  According to Standard and Poors, the author of the report, 82.14% of large-cap funds lost to the S&amp;P 500, 89.16% of small-cap core funds lost to the S&amp;P 600, and 86.08% of REIT funds underperformed the S&amp;P US Real Estate Investment Trust over the last ten years.</p><p> I have listened to many a portfolio manager in my day. They are impressive people with perfect backgrounds that will blow you away with their uncanny ability to memorize every interest rate move the Central Bank of Brazil has ever made and speak fluently about why they think the Turkish Lira/Japanese Yen cross trade is the most obvious &ldquo;fat pitch&rdquo; in the market today.</p><p> Larry Swedroe and Andrew Birken explain in the Incredible Shrinking Alpha that the underperformance of so many managers is not because they are dumb, but because of how insanely competitive the money management industry has become. The possibility of riches has attracted the best and brightest people in the world to the asset management business. As they all battle it out to try and make the best risk-adjusted returns, they make it very difficult to beat the averages.</p><p> Although nobody wants to be average, most of the peer-reviewed academic research will tell you that most investors are way better off owning low cost index funds and sitting on them for years.  When I see that only about 20% of mutual funds are beating their index over the last ten years, I realize that the odds are not in my favor of finding the unicorn manager in every single asset class I want to own.  By buying the index, I expect to beat about 4 out of 5 mutual funds for each asset class that I own.  I would not be disappointed toward the end of my life to learn that I had beaten 4 out of 5 funds for my entire investing career.</p><p> The things I have come to know is not what sells ads on financial television.  They are really quite boring and simple, but very hard to implement.  We are innately attracted to things like the headlines in January of 2016 that advised us to Sell Everything (How&rsquo;s that working for you?).  We often think that taking action is the most prudent move for our investments when in reality being diversified and having a strategy that is short-term boring and long-term rewarding is the best path for most of.</p><p> The foregoing content reflects the opinions of Domestique Capital LLC and is subject to change at any time without notice.

{"original_id":5867,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Take Advantage of Content Marketing Without Putting Your Company's Brand at Risk","link":"how-to-take-advantage-of-content-marketing-without-putting-your-companys-brand-at-risk","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Kevin Cain</p><p> When people hear the term content marketing they typically think of white papers and website copy, infographics and eBooks, blog posts and videos.</p><p> In short, they think of all of the content that their marketing teams produce to attract and retain great customers. And, while those are all great examples of the types of content that can be used for content marketing, the fact is that content marketing goes well beyond just marketing content.</p><p> The reality is that your marketing team members probably aren&rsquo;t the only people in your organisation who are creating content. There might, for example, be a group of writers housed somewhere in your product team who are responsible for creating technical content such as users&rsquo; manuals and product guides. Or maybe you have a corporate affairs team whose responsibilities include putting together a report on your company&rsquo;s social responsibility initiatives. Other companies have investor relations teams that create content for shareholders, not least of which includes the annual report. The list goes on.</p><p> The point is that there&rsquo;s a really good chance that you will find lots of non-marketers creating content across your organisation. If you&rsquo;re not taking advantage of that, or worse aren&rsquo;t even aware of it, you&rsquo;re not only missing out on a big opportunity, but also potentially putting your company&rsquo;s brand at risk.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s dig a little deeper into this.</p><h3> The opportunity: You&rsquo;ve got access to lots of great content, so start using it! <br/>  </h3><p> Content marketers often cite their inability to create enough content as the biggest challenge they face. In fact, it was the second most common challenge B2B marketers cited in the Content Marketing Institute and Marketing Prof&rsquo;s 2014 report on content marketing budgets, benchmarks, and trends. However, if you take a look around, you may quickly discover that there is far more content at your disposal than you could ever wish for. The key, of course, is identifying the value in that content and utilising it appropriately.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> For example, although you may think of your company&rsquo;s technical content as dry and boring, and not very effective as a marketing tool, that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case. In fact, technical content is becoming an increasingly useful tool for driving sales. According to one survey I saw recently, 32 percent of buyers look at product instructions before they buy. Good technical content is also very valuable for boosting customer satisfaction by, for instance, allowing people to troubleshoot their own challenges with a product without having to contact the help desk.</p><h3> The challenge: With lots of different people creating content, how do you ensure quality and consistency? <br/>  </h3><p> The downside to having all of those content creators across your organisation is that it greatly increases chances for inconsistency. Not only may different groups have different approaches to seemingly innocuous details such as whether or not they use serial commas, they may well also use different terminology, adopt a different tone of voice, or otherwise create content that doesn&rsquo;t properly align with your company&rsquo;s brand.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> As a result, your company might be producing content that collectively feels disjointed and that speaks to your audience in multiple distinct voices rather than just one. That in turn often leads to confusion, which can dilute your brand. In short, all of that content designed for your customers can actually work against you by turning them off.</p><p> So how do you take advantage of the opportunity while minimising the challenges?</p><p> The first step is to get your head around all of the content that your company is creating. Talk to your business partners and ask them to share their plans about what they plan on producing next. Then look for opportunities to utilize that content for your own content marketing efforts.</p><p> Beyond that, it&rsquo;s important to create and enforce standards. One way to do so is by creating brand and editorial style guides that establish the rules of the road for content creation within your organisation. The downside to this is that creating these guides is time-consuming and even once you have invested the resources into do so, enforcing them is incredibly difficult.</p><p> Another increasingly popular option it to consider using content optimization software, which often works within the content authoring tools you&rsquo;re already using, thereby ensuring that you adhere to the company&rsquo;s standards while creating each piece of content, rather than try to police for it after the fact.</p><p> The reality is that content marketing is about more than just marketing content. That may be a double-edged sword, but if you figure out how to manage it all, you will have a huge advantage.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-19 15:23:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-19 15:23:32.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_pewJK0L.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-take-advantage-of-content-marketing-without-putting-your-companys-brand-at-risk/\", \"post_id\": \"12583\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-19 15:23:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-19 15:23:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-take-advantage-of-content-marketing-without-putting-your-companys-brand-at-risk\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12582\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6115\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-take-advantage-content-marketing-without-putting-your-companys-brand-risk.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"516\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469026800,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

The German bank&rsquo;s all-clear signal halted a six-month slide on overcapacity, Brexit uncertainty and heightened fears of global terrorism.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/US-Airlines-Jump-Most-Since-2014-Following-Deutsche-Bank-Report.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Leading the group was American Airlines, which announced last Tuesday that it would renew its credit card deals with both Citigroup and Barclays, a move that&rsquo;s estimated to add $1.55 billion to the carrier&rsquo;s pretax income over the next three years&mdash;$200 million this year, $550 million in 2017 and $800 million in 2018.</p><p> The agreement will allow Citi to offer its credit cards to new customers on American Airlines&rsquo; website and mobile apps, through direct mail and in Admirals Club lounges, while Barclaycard will be permitted to reach customers in airports and during American flights.</p><p> Investors also rewarded Delta for better-than-expected profits, which rose 4.1 percent to $1.55 billion in the second quarter. In an effort to push up fares, the number two carrier announced plans that it would cut capacity on U.S.-U.K. flights due to British pound weakness following Brexit.</p><h3> Playing the Long Game with Near-Term Results <br/>  </h3><p> Looking ahead, aircraft-makers Boeing and Airbus both see huge growth in deliveries as the global middle class continues to swell in rank. In its Current Market Outlook, Boeing projects total demand for nearly 40,000 new jets over the next 20 years&mdash;a 4 percent increase over last year&rsquo;s forecast&mdash;with a large percentage of the growth occurring in Asia. Altogether, these deals are valued at a monumental $5.9 trillion.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-07-15/COMM-total-new-jet-deliveries-estimated-at-5-9-trillion-07152016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"309\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Total-new-jet-deliveries-estimated-at-5-9-trillion.png\" width=\"600\"/> </a></p><p> Airbus&rsquo; forecast, while somewhat more conservative, is no less impressive. The French airline manufacturer sees demand for more than 33,000 new aircrafts between now and 2035, all with a market value of $5.2 trillion.</p><p> The lion&rsquo;s share of this expansion is expected to take place in emerging and developing countries such as India and China, where middle class growth is booming. Higher incomes should heat up flight demand and help air traffic double over the next 15 years, according to Airbus. In India alone, air traffic is expected to accelerate fivefold between now and 2035. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sees the number of global revenue passenger miles rising from 877 billion in 2015 to 1.02 trillion in 2024.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Global-middle-class-to-move-from-2-8-billion-to-4-8-billion-in-20-years.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> In the near term, domestic airlines continue to trade at extremely low multiples compared to other stocks in the industrials sector. Compare airlines&rsquo; price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to transportation stocks and the broader stock market. Whereas American is trading at a little over 4 times earnings, transportation stocks&mdash;which include trucks, railroads and other industrials&mdash;trade at more than 14 times earnings. The S&amp;P 500 Index, meanwhile, currently trades at more than 20 times earnings.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"277\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Domestic-Airlines-Price-to-Earnings.png\" width=\"653\"/> Domestic carriers also continue to return money to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buyback programs. American, for example, repurchased more than 50 million shares, worth $1.7 billion, in the second quarter. As of March, Southwest Airlines had a phenomenal three-year dividend growth rate of 101.2 percent, according to GuruFocus data. This helps support the thesis that the industry offers many attractive buying opportunities right now.</p><h3> How Regulations Have Hurt Retail Investors <br/>  </h3><p> In past weeks and months, I&rsquo;ve written about how excessive regulations are atrophying global economic growth. Granted, regulations are often well intentioned and necessary to create a level playing field. But when they grow too large in number and scope, it&rsquo;s a little like having more referees than players on the basketball court.</p><p> Here in the U.S., federal regulations cost U.S. businesses more than $1.88 trillion a year. If they were their own economy, American regulations would be the ninth largest in the world, just ahead of Russia. Small businesses, which are responsible for more than half of all U.S. sales and employ 55 percent of all American workers, increasingly rank regulations as one of the top challenges facing their growth and survival.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t just an American phenomenon, of course. Last month, Brits voted to leave the European Union largely because they recognize overzealous regulation and envy policies as impediments to innovation. They&rsquo;re tired of falling behind. Why else did the European Commission recently require American tech giants Netflix and Amazon to guarantee that at least 20 percent of their streaming video content is shot in Europe? Were EU rules not so corrosive to innovation, the continent might have its own Silicon Valley and its own Netflix (and, I might add, more attractive tax incentives to produce movies and TV shows in their countries).</p><p> Now, thanks to a slide deck from InvestX Financial CEO Marcus New, it&rsquo;s clear just how detrimental U.S. regulations have been in the formation of capital. In the years preceding 2001, we could have expected to see 100 new companies on average go public every quarter. Since then, that number has fallen to around 30. Because of the mounting risks involved, the gestation period leading up to an IPO has ballooned from three years to more than 13 years, with an average $261 million raised per issuer, compared to $88 million between 1990 and 2001.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Most-Profit-Now-Generated-Private-Stage-Typically-Fewer-than-50-Investors.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Also because of regulations, smaller retail investors have effectively been blocked from participating in higher-yielding investments&mdash;namely, private equity and venture capital, whose 10-year compound annual growth rates have averaged 11.8 and 11 percent, quite a bit more than Treasuries, equities and other common asset classes.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Investors-Are-Locked-out-of-1-Asset-Class.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> For the most part, only accredited investors&mdash;those who have earned income that exceeds $200,000 or a net worth of over $1 million&mdash;are permitted to participate. As a result, it&rsquo;s only the rich who get, well, richer.</p><p> Again, these rules are well intentioned. The justification is that everyday investors should be protected from the heightened risks involved in more sophisticated assets. At the same time, many people are being restricted from opportunities that might help them move up the socioeconomic ladder&mdash;opportunities that are open only to those who&rsquo;ve already &ldquo;made it.&rdquo;</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> It seems, then, that the Occupy Movement and other class warriors who criticize and bash the 1 percent for &ldquo;stealing all the wealth&rdquo; would do well to direct some of their ire at the socialist rules responsible for restricting their social mobility.</p><p> Personal finance and investing were among the many topics discussed last week at FreedomFest, &ldquo;the largest gathering of free minds,&rdquo; which I regrettably couldn&rsquo;t attend this year. FreedomFest was founded in 2002 by my friend Mark Skousen, then-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and author of several books, including one of my favorites, The Big Three in Economics: Adam Smith, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes. I highly recommend you check it out.</p><h3> Keep Munis Tax-Free <br/>  </h3><p> You might be aware of the debate happening right now on whether to lift the tax exemption on municipal bonds. Last Friday, Municipal Bonds for America (MBFA) sent a letter to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to affirm its opposition &ldquo;to any legislative proposal that taxes, in whole or in part, municipal bonds.&rdquo;</p><p> Tax-free munis, as the coalition points out, have long been responsible for funding public infrastructure projects, from schools to highways to airports to seaports.</p><p> Part of munis&rsquo; appeal as an investment is that they are tax-free at the federal level and often the state and local levels. Removing the exemption could dramatically limit their attractiveness, which would ultimately affect America&rsquo;s ability to maintain livable communities.</p><p> But here&rsquo;s why I believe it won&rsquo;t happen. Both major candidates for president, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, strongly support increasing infrastructure spending. In fact, it&rsquo;s the one thing they have in common with each other. I don&rsquo;t believe either President Trump or President Clinton would be in favor of allowing munis to be taxed, thereby risking financing for new projects.</p><h3> A Brokered Democratic Convention? <br/>  </h3><p> In closing, it might seem like a done deal that Hillary and Trump will be our nominees. After all, Senator Bernie Sanders finally threw in the towel, endorsing his Democratic rival.</p><p> But don&rsquo;t count Sanders out just yet, especially now that the investigation into Hillary&rsquo;s private email server has bruised her poll numbers. There&rsquo;s historical precedence for a contested convention. In 1932, Franklin Roosevelt&mdash;who, like Sanders, was considered by many to be too far left to win the general election&mdash;failed to garner the necessary two-thirds majority of delegates. He was even rumored to have endorsed his rival, Governor Al Smith. And yet, Roosevelt brokered a deal at the convention that won him his party&rsquo;s nomination and, eventually, the presidency.</p><p> Will history repeat itself? Could Sanders attempt to do the same? We&rsquo;ll find out soon enough.</p><p> With political uncertainty high, and with fiscal and monetary policies imbalanced, gold remains an attractive asset class. As always, I suggest a 10 percent weighting in gold bullion and gold stocks, with a rebalance either quarterly or annually.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-19 15:27:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-19 15:27:07.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_5gwT5Dw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-airlines-finally-ready-to-take-off-for-investors/\", \"post_id\": \"12591\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-19 15:27:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-19 15:27:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-airlines-finally-ready-to-take-off-for-investors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12584\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6116\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/are-airlines-finally-ready-take-investors.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"870\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469005200,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

Intuitively, we all &ldquo;know&rdquo; this to be true. But very, very few people truly understand how far this principle extends. If I&rsquo;m honest, I didn&rsquo;t either. So over the past year, I decided to run a little experiment.</p><h3> Put the Pareto Law to the test, if you will. <br/>  </h3><p> First, I started by identifying a set of key metrics for my business; things that, when they link up in chain, produce extraordinary results for my business.

{"original_id":5870,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Greatest Danger in the World Today","link":"the-greatest-danger-in-the-world-today","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> In the first Democratic Debate a question which differentiated the candidates was this: What do you view as the greatest danger facing the next presidency? <br/>  </h3><p> China! the Middle East! Global Warming! No, trumped Hillary: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nuclear material getting into the wrong hands!&rdquo; I get it. Fear is a powerful tool in the hands of politicians. Though it would never win a campaign, I say that the greatest danger of our time is existential schizophrenia: the danger that humanity will lose its bearings and self-destruct! How? The craziness might take many forms. It can begin with paranoia, or simple ignorance, stirred by rhetoric that ignores the whole truth while madly fixating on isolated facts.</p><p> The existential philosopher, Martin Heidegger coined the term &ldquo;existential schizophrenia&rdquo; to describe a general cultural morass already in the early 20th Century when crazy-making, repetitive factory work and the madness of war had already set in. The symptoms are clear: modern people are more than ever capable of thinking one thing, feeling another and then doing things which are entirely disconnected from their thoughts and feelings&hellip;this can be dangerous and self-destructive. Ultimately the greatest danger is that society will not stop to consider the impact of over-reactive policies and self-destructive behaviors.</p><p> These behaviors may range from the seeming harmlessness of mindless consumerism that in fact consumes the planet, to a proliferation of weapons supposedly to make us safer but instead multiplying the violence. As Heidegger put it: &ldquo;The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking.&rdquo; Humor can easily jump on ignorance, like this video that went viral.</p><p> Long before suicide bombs were common, the a capella singing group, The Bob&rsquo;s, characterized the nihilism of consumerism with morbid humor in their classic piece  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqCaz6lsfE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Spontaneous Human Combustion </a>  where instead of terrorists, shoppers in a crowded mall blow up spontaneously when they hear &ldquo;buy one get one free!&rdquo; Nowadays a kind of confusing disconnectedness is spreading even to the most thoughtful among us, pointing more credibly than ever to planetary self-destruction.</p><p> In last years&rsquo; annual Christmas greeting to the governing body of the Vatican, Pope Francis defined one of the 15 Diseases of the so-called Roman Curia as &ldquo;Existential schizophrenia: the sickness of those who live a double life, fruit of the hypocrisy typical of the mediocre &hellip;. They create a parallel world of their own, where they set aside everything they teach with severity to others and live a hidden, often dissolute life.&rdquo;</p><p> In a world that is disjointed, strong leaders can prevail when acting out in ways that their followers would never dare.</p><p> The electorate&rsquo;s fear of political correctness can be dramatically trumped by politicians&rsquo; inflammatory statements that may be secretly harbored by voters in a confused world. Hopelessness fuels this flame and may lead to horrific decisions and violent acts such as a young woman who is willing to blow herself up, or a captain of commerce who knowingly pollutes our planet for profit. Neither can credibly integrate their thoughts and feelings with their actions. Both are destructive and deadly. Both may inspire others with their audacious acts of violence. Both may be pitied because they are caught in a destructive trap, though one may be materially impoverished and the other wealthy beyond belief. Both believe they&rsquo;re right.</p><p> As a culture we have reached an existential crisis, a crisis in meaning when suicide is becoming acceptable. Suicide used to be an unthinkable act and now kills more soldiers than war. Every day 22 American soldiers take their own life. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Premature deaths are often caused by decisions that are dis-integrated from healthy thoughts and feelings. Deciding to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol, is an example. My purpose is to highlight our global responsibility as stewards, not to destroy our world prematurely with war and pollution and to take care of each other. One day the Earth may come to its natural end, but surely not now, not yet. And the macro-responsibility to save the planet from self-destruction is reflected in the micro: many suicides, including some acts of terrorism, might not occur given a healthy community of support. Romanticizing the loss of young peoples&rsquo; lives as martyrs for any cause, or even condemning them as murderous, may be glossing over the real causes of death. Whether the pain of hopelessness in this world, or the illness of a mental imbalance, lives might have been saved by the kindness of a sane, compassionate world.</p><p> A great candidate would face what others ignore, boldly illuminating any self-destructive agenda that fosters investments that are driven by short-term greed, and proliferates terrorism and war based on fear. They would call for compassion and model confidence that humanity can find a course toward mutual benefit. A true leader could prevail against existential schizophrenia with a holistic approach: for example, the ideals of the French Revolution fostering a culture of Liberty rather than repression, political Equality, and Fraternity in relation to the production and distribution of goods and services.

{"original_id":5871,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Many Myths and Misconceptions About Divorce","link":"the-many-myths-and-misconceptions-about-divorce","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> As you approach your golden years, you realize you may be heading toward divorce. <br/>  </h3><p> Now you start asking questions: how does one start the process, how much is it going to cost, and how long does it take?</p><p> Many Baby Boomers have misconceptions about divorce. These misconceptions arise from all sorts of people who mean well but mislead when sharing their own experiences and &ldquo;knowledge from the battlefield&rdquo;. Everyone has a story to tell. It seems that either they came through divorce reasonably well or they are financially devastated by divorce. The perils of not knowing what lie ahead seem enormous. Your anxiety is clearly growing as it becomes increasingly confusing to know what are the facts versus what is fiction, both legally and financially.</p><p> Divorce myths abound in this fertile environment but are particularly dangerous for those nearing retirement. The trend for gray divorces is strong, and with longer life spans, there is a need to educate Baby Boomers about how to avoid common financial mistakes in divorce that last a life time. It takes a powerful discipline to ferret out myths about divorce and rely on your team of divorce professionals.</p><p> Some of the most common myths include:</p><p> &bull; &ldquo;Everything is split 50/50.&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t get any of my inheritance.&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;If I move out, the Judge will say I&rsquo;ve abandoned my house/my kids!&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my name, so it&rsquo;s all mine.&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;Our agreements about the kids are final.&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;The credit cards are in her name, so all of the debt is hers.&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;He had an affair, I should get more (alimony and assets)&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;The Wife never pays alimony&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get alimony now, I can always get it later&rdquo;</p><p> Each state has its own divorce laws for how income and property will be shared. Support is defined, quantified, and qualified by a number of specific factors in each state. Property is distributed in divorce following one of two approaches: equitable distribution (not equal) or community property.</p><p> When it comes to spousal support, it has to be determined if there is an entitlement for spousal support. The purpose of spousal support is to limit the unfair economic effects of a divorce by having one spouse provide an ongoing income to a non-wage or lower earning spouse. It is intended to continue a duty to support. It is not intended to punish a &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; spouse. It is gender neutral in our society.</p><p> Courts are increasingly awarding less alimony and for shorter periods of time. Spousal support remains a controversial subject because it is a discretionary calculation and nearly different in each divorce. Some states embrace a new formula approach for alimony based on income disparity and length of marriage, much like child support formulas, and allow for factors to deviate from the formula. No matter what approach, Baby Boomers in long term marriages face a stark reality. With a limited number of earning years left, or if none, there is no income to share. Spousal support is interdependent on the rest of the financial pieces of the puzzle that fall into place for a final outcome. Hopefully, you have sufficient assets (including pensions, retirement plans, social security, etc.) to meet your living needs. Lastly, be sure you know that if you waive alimony, you forfeit forever your right to it after divorce. Alimony is generally taxable to the payee and tax deductible to the payor.</p><p> State property laws form the basis of property ownership. When spouses cannot agree on who gets what property, the courts to allocate it to them. In states of equitable distribution, equitable does NOT mean equal. Courts have discretion how to allocate between spouses, regardless of titling. The goal is to make sure property division is fair with respect to the contributions each spouse to the marriage and what each party needs after divorce. In community property states (there are 9), community property is divided EQUALLY between spouses and separate property is owned / kept by just one spouse. Dividing property in divorce is a one shot deal (rarely any retakes) and has no tax consequences at time of transfer.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> So listen with a grain of salt to your friends, relatives, and colleagues about what you should be getting or giving in divorce. No one knows what is most important to you for financial security and peace of mind but you. Understand the divorce laws in your state. Advocate your needs properly, separate emotional from financial. Hire a team to educate you about pros and cons of financial decision-making during the divorce process. State divorce laws simply give you a foundation for ending your marriage contract and not a guaranteed outcome.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-19 15:31:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-19 15:31:34.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_foTtk2e.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-many-myths-and-misconceptions-about-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"12597\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-19 15:31:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-19 15:31:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-many-myths-and-misconceptions-about-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12596\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6119\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/many-myths-and-misconceptions-about-divorce.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"764\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469034000,"author_id":307,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5872,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Getting Chased by a Bear Can Teach You About Leadership","link":"what-getting-chased-by-a-bear-can-teach-you-about-leadership","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Imagine a bear is chasing you. Imagine how frightened you&rsquo;d be. Your brain would be in overdrive, trying to think of how to stay alive. It would be a harrowing experience, one you would never want to repeat. <br/>  </h3><p> Now imagine you are a leader and you own your own business. You&rsquo;ve just realized in order to stay in business you need to make a radical change to your company, one that doesn&rsquo;t exactly match the original plan for the business, but is nevertheless crucial to stay alive.</p><p> As the leader in the latter scenario you may not think you have anything in common with the person being chased by a bear, but your brain activity would say otherwise, because your brains are reacting in the same exact way.</p><p> Our brains have a hard time telling the difference between life-threatening emergencies and the smaller daily stresses. So our natural fight/flight response system kicks into gear when we have to deal with change of some kind.</p><p> Change scares people more than death. To drive that point home, 90% of people who have undergone coronary bypass surgery do not change their lifestyle, despite the fact that they have just received the scare of their lives.</p><p> So it begs the question: why do we resist change? After all, change is the essence of life. All the cells in your body have changed since you read the last sentence; you will be older by the time you finish reading this article. Change is why you started a business in the first place and how everything that has ever happened has come to be. Yet, once the change becomes the norm we fear any alteration to it. It&rsquo;s a willful ignorance of how the norm came to be in the first place.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s why we resist:  Change creates psychological discomfort. <br/>  </h3><p> Brain analysis technology has proven that change activates the prefrontal cortex, which functions like a control center. It receives data, processes it, and determines actions in accordance with our internal goals. It is also connected to the emotional center of our brain (the amygdala, part of the limbic system). This means that when change is approaching, decisions are often steeped in emotion versus logic.</p><p> A firestorm of emotions can happen in our heads (fear, anger, depression, fatigue, anxiety) that chemically urge us to fight for the status quo. That fear response can cause impulsive, shortsighted decision-making that impedes performance.</p><h3> Change is exhausting <br/>  </h3><p> We develop habits that become hard to break. Breaking out of our comfort zone requires energy and perseverance, and it can wear you out. Every decision we make from the moment we wake up chips away at our will power. By the time you arrive to the office you&rsquo;ve already made so many decisions &ndash; from what to wear to what to eat to what you&rsquo;re going to do when you arrive &ndash; that you&rsquo;re already somewhat depleted. Hence why some leaders (Zuckerberg for instance) wear a uniform (jeans and a hoody): it&rsquo;s one less decision they have to make.</p><p> The good news is creating new habits creates new neural pathways for dopamine receptors. So as the new habits become routine they will make you feel good as you maintain them. The dopamine release will begin to counter the effect of the initial exhaustion from having initiated a new pattern in your work life.</p><h3> Change triggers bias <br/>  </h3><p> There are many biases that get triggered once our brains begin to process the prospect of change, but the two most prevalent, painfully obvious &ndash; and damaging &ndash; are the sunk cost bias and the status quo bias.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the sunk cost bias, it occurs once we&rsquo;ve sunk our time, effort, and emotion into an activity. Once we&rsquo;ve made that commitment we are none too eager to let it go. We&rsquo;ve sunk the time and effort into completing / perfecting the process and the cost of that is we now have attachment to that particular method or thing. Rather than switch gears our inclination is to keep sinking money and more effort into this process because we&rsquo;ve made that commitment.</p><p> The status quo bias causes us to rely on information that represents the current state or on previous choices that created current conditions. This is done at the expense of considering all available information when making a decision. The status quo bias includes the natural tendency to:</p><li> Refrain from action altogether because you&rsquo;d rather do nothing than make a mistake</li><li> Favor a current routine over new options</li><li> View current conditions favorably because that provides a measure of calm</li><h3> Here&rsquo;s 3 things you can change: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Recognize Bias <br/>  </h3><p> Know that your brain is probably lying to you and making excuses for not wanting to change. It&rsquo;s natural. It&rsquo;s normal. It&rsquo;s inevitable. Pay attention to any fight/flight responses, fear/anxiety, and investigate what is motivating your reactions.</p><p> I also recommend gathering folks around you that do not share your sense of dread and also those who do. Getting folks in a room together to walk through the process of change helps pick away at the defenses and biases that are so strongly built to keep us safe. One way to gain insight into your own resistance is to simply ask yourself (or others) some pointed questions:</p><li> What are the benefits for keeping things the way they are?</li><li> How am I limited by keeping things the way they are?</li><li> What&rsquo;s the worst &amp; best that can happen if we head in this direction?</li><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 2. Reframe <br/>  </h3><p> How you respond to change has a lot to do with how you frame the scenario. Framing a change as an opportunity rather than a threat will go a long way with your resistance to the change.</p><h3> 3. Recoup <br/>  </h3><p> Get the necessary rest to think with a level head. Sometimes being stuck or resistant is the result of being worn down. Sometimes you literally don&rsquo;t have the mental energy or rest to make the necessary changes for success. Get some good R&amp;R and come back to the drawing table with a clear and open mind.</p><p> Your business (and your gut) is going to be the first thing that tells you whether change is necessary. If you see a drop in sales, in employee engagement, you are plateauing, or getting sick and tired of something or someone, it might be time to question whether some change is necessary.</p><p> When you face the prospect of change do your best to keep an open, fearless mind.

Even companies with a formal succession planning process in place often find themselves unable to fill new roles effectively, moving new people into vacant roles only to find that the successors are not nearly as effective as their predecessors. Some new hires can&rsquo;t get their teams on board. Others take far too long to build their side of the business. Why aren&rsquo;t these companies getting the performance they expected from their plan? Data.</p><p> In order to have an effective succession planning process, these companies need to build their succession plan based on the right data. They, very likely, ignored competencies or only slightly considered them before moving forward to creating a description that matched the person they thought they were seeking.</p><p> Often times, what we think makes a person a success in a particular position is not what actually makes her a success. If it is, it is generally only a small piece of the picture. Competency models help address these misperceptions and ensure that board members and other management teams have the complete picture necessary to replace key people in as little time as possible.</p><p> For an organization to build an effective succession planning process, planning and competencies must go hand in hand. Competency identification &ndash; the process of identifying the competencies that are essential for a particular job &ndash; is a good place to start. The competencies sought during the identification process are the competencies that separate the best performers from the average performers across the same roles.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> What is it that makes one payroll manager better than another? Why can that one IT technician repair a machine or design a network so much faster and more efficiently than the others on his team? Why does that one manager have the highest retention rates of any department in the company? When you can identify the differences between people in the same type of positions, you can start to build a competency model that shows which combination of competencies is most likely to result in success for that specific role.</p><p> This identification process can get complicated and time-consuming, but there are many software programs that can help make it easier and faster. Talent management programs also exist to assist managers and executive boards with taking those models one step further by using them to compare existing employees against the models (called competency assessment). Management can then quickly identify the highest potential employees for any one key role, and move those high potentials into the succession plan, thereby ensuring plenty of time for training and overall development. By including competencies and competency models in the backbones of your succession plan, you dramatically increase the likelihood of success &ndash;for your successors, their team, and the company as a whole.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-19 15:35:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-19 15:35:39.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_Q6gHWRJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-key-to-effective-succession-planning/\", \"post_id\": \"12601\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-19 15:35:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-19 15:35:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-key-to-effective-succession-planning\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12600\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6121\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/key-effective-succession-planning.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"570\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469030400,"author_id":309,"chart_url":""}

Bill, we were just talking about the Seattle International Film Festival.

He had an idea for a new software application (then partially developed) and though I had no particular experience in the industry that would use his application; I must admit it sounded really good.</p><p> Normally, I would not get too excited about just an idea, but this idea was clearly addressing a big problem in the target industry. He was very excited about the prospects as he should be--His passion and intensity was very high. He explained how he would market the application to retailers and it became clear that the application was simply the beginning. He had plans to monetize the application with retailers who would pay a small fee (say 3%) for each sale transacted through his website portal. The potential revenue and profit was high as the end market was measured in tens of billions of dollars.</p><p> When I asked how his idea, application, and website would defend itself from other entrepreneurs and competitors, he became speechless and drifted back to talking about the market. This was a red flag for me. My expectation would have been to hear something about IP and trade secret protections, first-mover advantage, etc. I burrowed in again: Have you secured the IP for the idea and invention? No answer.</p><p> Now, my question becomes pointed and directly asked. Do you have a patent or patent application for your invention? In this case, his invention would have revolved around a method of doing business that depended upon three key pieces of technology, each of which was either not an invention or already public. That another invention can depend upon a unique assembly of constituent ideas, process, or parts is not new, of course, but when applied to a market in a unique and innovative way, the idea was non-obvious and had the potential to become a patented invention. His answer: NO. He had neither a patent nor patent applications accomplished.</p><p> Immediately, no heart sank. Because, I knew he would eventually compete with others who had the money to build and brand a competitive business. His potential for long-term success was significantly eroded by the lack of secured IP. Importantly, knowing that the amount of money required to get into business was not small (though not large either), the likelihood that a professional investor would become involved was small if not non-existent.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> I left the conversation with a recommendation that he immediately file a provisional patent application, review existing patents and the environment (via the Internet), and file additional provisional patents that would protect his idea/invention. After consulting with a patent attorney who would do an independent review of the patent landscape he would then have an idea of whether or not his invention had good prospects for eventually being granted a patent. My own guess was that he had a good chance of getting a patent.</p><p> But, the lesson is clear for entrepreneurs; that is, be sure to file one or more provisional patent applications at the earliest stages and vigilantly research the key aspects of the invention and potential markets so that the future company&rsquo;s IP is both secured and robust. The expected IP becomes a barrier to entry to other future competitors and creates value that professional investors will appreciate. This may seem like a no-brainer to many experienced technology entrepreneurs but the importance is not obvious to all would-be entrepreneurs.</p><p> Entrepreneurs, please, please, please remember to secure your IP first.</p><p> Failure to do so is like going on a long hike without any food or water&mdash;sooner or later you will have to stop and go back to where you started your hike or expire along the trail.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-20 14:57:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-20 14:57:40.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_89NQrL4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/entrepreneurs-dont-forget-to-secure-your-ip-and-trade-secrets/\", \"post_id\": \"12607\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-20 14:57:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-20 14:57:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"entrepreneurs-dont-forget-to-secure-your-ip-and-trade-secrets\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12606\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6124\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/entrepreneurs-dont-forget-secure-your-ip-and-trade-secrets.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"910\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469127600,"author_id":408,"chart_url":""}

That&rsquo;s because many brokers and other non-fiduciaries are incentivized to sell you investments that generate fat commissions, whether or not the investments are in your best interest. This new rule comes from the Department of Labor, and it&rsquo;s a huge step to empower individual investors and save them billions of dollars.</p><p> According to the DoL, the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that U.S. consumers waste $17 billion every year on outrageous fees paid to advisors.</p><p> The fiduciary rule won&rsquo;t go into effect until April 2017, but now is the time to begin arming yourself with the information you need to verify your advisor is on your side. Once the new rule kicks in, a lot of financial advisors will jump on the bandwagon to claim they are fiduciaries, even if they or the firms where they work aren&rsquo;t.</p><p> Remember Bernie Madoff? He too claimed he was a fiduciary investment advisor. But the reality is, it doesn&rsquo;t take a sociopath to bilk you out of your retirement savings. There are plenty of perfectly legal (though often unethical) ways for advisors to help you lose your money.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Even comedian John Oliver poked fun at non-fiduciary financial advisors in his eye-opening monologue video (posted on Newsweek) outlining all the ways sleazy advisors leech off clients&rsquo; retirement savings by selling investments with huge fees that clients didn&rsquo;t even know they paid.</p><p> Financial advisors may &ldquo;pinky swear&rdquo; that they meet the higher fiduciary standard, but these five questions will help you ascertain who&rsquo;s a fiduciary and who&rsquo;s giving you a slick sales pitch.</p><h3> 1. Are you really a fiduciary advisor&mdash;can I have it in writing please? <br/>  </h3><p> If the advisor you&rsquo;re considering hiring isn&rsquo;t willing to state this in writing, run the other way. </p><h3> 2. How am I paying you? <br/>  </h3><p> Commission-driven brokers or advisors earn most of their income by selling certain funds, annuities or other investment products. Sales charges for these types of brokers or advisors can run 3% to 6% off the top of your investment. Sometimes the company whose product they are pitching pays their commission as a &ldquo;marketing expense&rdquo; in what basically amounts to a kick-back. The problem with this is that commissions create a conflict of interest for the advisor because they have a huge incentive to recommend the option that pays them the most&mdash;whether or not it is really the best investment for you. Some advisors are basically just high-paid salespeople, so transparency is the hallmark of a real fiduciary advisor. </p><h3> 3. How much will your advice cost me?  <br/>  </h3><p> No one expects free advice, but a fiduciary advisor is willing to put in writing all the fees and expenses associated with the relationship, and many will be happy to provide you with a good faith estimate of what your typical yearly expenses will be. This includes all the expenses incurred whenever buying or selling an investment. </p><h3> 4. Who is the custodian for your clients&rsquo; accounts? <br/>  </h3><p> This question will help you protect yourself because this is how Bernie Madoff was able to get away with fraud. His clients wrote their investment checks directly to a brokerage that was also owned by him, which meant there was no third-party verification in place to protect them. A real fiduciary advisor makes sure your money is held by a recognized custodian such as Schwab, TD, Fidelity, or another big name. </p><h3> 5. May I see your background records? <br/>  </h3><p> You probably check your dog sitter&rsquo;s references, so what about your advisor&rsquo;s records? A good fiduciary advisor is more than willing to make everything available, but you can check his background yourself in less than 15 minutes. Just visit FINRA&rsquo;s BrokerCheck site and the SEC&rsquo;s Investment Advisor Public Disclosure site and enter the individual&rsquo;s name and/ or the name of the firm. He should be willing to give you his CRD (Central Registration Depository) number to make the searches even easier.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-20 15:00:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-20 15:00:04.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_ToBy9I2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/remember-bernie-madoff-5-questions-you-must-ask-to-avoid-bad-financial-advice/\", \"post_id\": \"12609\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-20 15:00:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-20 15:00:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"remember-bernie-madoff-5-questions-you-must-ask-to-avoid-bad-financial-advice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12608\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6125\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/remember-bernie-madoff-5-questions-you-must-ask-avoid-bad-financial-advice.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1249\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469102400,"author_id":372,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5878,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Target Marketing: Why You Need to Find Your \"Tribe\"","link":"target-marketing-why-you-need-to-find-your-tribe","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My 18-year-old daughter, Jenna, took the photo below. We were walking out of the dentist office after she had a cleaning. This was our first visit to the dentist since our relocation to St. Louis and this was posted by the door.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/are-you-targeting-your-market_orig.jpg\" width=\"347\"/> <br/> <br/> At first, to be honest, I was a little turned off, but after a little thought I remembered asking the scheduler when I made the appointment, \"Pain is a very real concern for our family. We don't want to experience any or it will be difficult to get my family to come back!\" I was half joking, but not really. The scheduler said, \"Nope - we get it - we take care to make sure that doesn't happen.\" So - here was their disclaimer - posted right on the wall for everyone to see. My family is their tribe.</p><p> I have mad respect for Seth Godin. He has authored more than 17 books specific to the topic of marketing authentically. For me, he is the pinnacle of achieving the enigma of being a \"guru.\" [I rarely bequeath that title on ANYONE, but the dude has skillz] He is also the ONLY person Twitter I allow in my mind to have the right to a half-million followers while his only following one account. Typically, I feel there should be a ratio, but with someone who shares poignant thoughts every single time, again - he is the rarity of what I allow in my mind in breaking the rules. <br/> <br/> Seth Godin understands what makes people tick and I've learned a lot from him. I also owe a debt of gratitude to my friend, Ann Handley, for making so many dreams come true when we had the opportunity to meet him in Boston a few years back. #THANK YOU <br/> <br/> It's a rare occasion to hear Seth talk about \"target marketing\". He is passionately attached to the idea that we each must work with those we serve well. Ahh - love it. In financial services, this couldn't be truer than true.</p><h3> WHAT IS TARGET MARKETING? <br/>  </h3><p> In a nutshell - you are basically interested in a particular group of individuals and you aim your services to those individuals. Seth Godin refers to this often as your \"tribe\" - and for example, my tribe is Financial Services. <br/> <br/> After four years of in-depth work in marketing with financial service professionals, I will tell you I have taken it a step further. I have REALLY defined my tribe to only include those who are willing to market their business in a different way, adopt principles I know work well, and then adapt those principles to their specific audience. I am no longer spending time trying to convert the nonconvertible. They are not part of my tribe.</p><h3> WHY DO I NEED TO KNOW MY TRIBE? <br/>  </h3><p> When I talk to financial service professionals, I ask the same question every single time, \"Tell me about your ideal client.\" Many cannot define this and it's imperative to your business's long-term success that you do. How do you know who you want to work with if you have no idea what they look like? <br/> <br/> Be specific too. You are trying to differentiate yourself from others and you need to segment your market. Are they:</p><li> male/female/gender neutral</li><li> affluent - define what affluent means to you</li><li> in a specific cultural group</li><li> married/single</li><li> old/young</li><li> white-collar/blue-collar</li><p> You don't have to apologize for your tribe's traits either. This helps you define who you want to work and will serve well. Remember, tribes are always about service.</p><h3> WORK WITH THOSE WHO WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU <br/>  </h3><p> So this is where the differentiation starts kicking in. You want to work with those who actually want to hear from you. You must define your ideal client in order to target them. That's how it works.</p><p> ##TRENDING## <br/> <br/> When I hear people say, \"That person is so lucky - getting clients is so easy for them\" do you know why? They know who they are after. Does your team know the traits of your tribe? I can promise you many in sales do not. They get desperate, start throwing up on people, then fail miserably and are bitter. Then they say they were never meant to work in the #FinServ market - that's simply not true! </p><h3> DO YOU NEED HELP DEFINING YOUR TRIBE? <br/>  </h3><p> If so - don't be ashamed; do something about it instead. Reach out to me and let's talk. I want to see you be successful because your community needs that special gift only you have.  <br/> <br/> Stop being afflicted by Shiny Object Syndrome and let's get specific so you can be focused and start targeting those who matter to you and you will serve well. <br/> <br/> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-20 15:02:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-20 15:02:47.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_zgWudSK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/target-marketing-why-you-need-to-find-your-tribe/\", \"post_id\": \"12612\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-20 15:02:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-20 15:02:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"target-marketing-why-you-need-to-find-your-tribe\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12610\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6126\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/target-marketing-why-you-need-find-your-tribe.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"655\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469098800,"author_id":441,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5879,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Next-Level Management: The Mother Of All Value Drivers","link":"next-level-management-the-mother-of-all-value-drivers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In the prior post,  <a href=\"/strategies/exit-planning/the-role-of-next-level-management-in-building-transferable-value\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Transferable Business Value And What Drives It </a> , I described value drivers&mdash;business characteristics that buyers demand if they are to purchase your business. Value drivers are critical because they can create transferable value.Transferable value is what your business is worth, to someone else, without you.An easy way to determine if your company has transferable value is to ask, &ldquo;If I permanently leave my business today, will it continue with minimal disruption to its cash flow?&rdquo; An obvious follow-up question is, &ldquo;Who is going to be responsible for running my business without me&mdash;and with minimal disruption to cash flow?&rdquo; The answer can only be, &ldquo;My company&rsquo;s management.&rdquo;Perhaps less obvious than management as responsible for future performance is management as instrumental in growing cash flow&mdash;business value&mdash;beyond your capabilities. Next-level management is, indeed, the mother of all value drivers. The father of modern management, Peter Drucker, says this about entrepreneurial management, &ldquo;It requires . . . building a top management team long before the new venture actually needs one and long before it can actually afford one.&rdquo;</p><h3> Next-Level Managers</h3>As the name implies, next-level managers are typically those who have worked in companies that are larger, often much larger, than yours. Next-level managers know how to grow your company at least to the level of the larger companies they&rsquo;ve worked for. They have experience and skill sets appropriate for the company you want and need it to become.This I believe is part of Drucker&rsquo;s message to entrepreneurs: to grow a business significantly requires management that knows how and what to do&mdash;indeed has done it before for a larger company.<h3> Three Tasks For Owners</h3>To help your company move forward in developing and retaining next-level management you have three ownership tasks.<strong> Task 1. Attract and retain next-level management. This may involve training and coaching existing management to the level needed, adding next-level management, and replacing or transferring underperforming management.</strong>I appreciate that making the decision to replace existing management is not easy. Owners usually have a gut feeling when doing so is the right decision, but that intuition butts up against loyalty, friendship and the obligation they feel toward long-time managers.In considering whether to replace part or all of your management team realize that doing so is normal for rapidly growing companies. Next-level management, in large part, causes that growth. Eventually, the first set of next-level managers may also be replaced.Hiring next-level management does not mean casting out your management with six weeks of severance pay. Members of your current management team may still be very valuable&mdash;just in different roles. Often they can remain employed and perform well and responsibly, but in a sphere more appropriate to their experience level.<strong> Task 2. Engage management consultants and outside resources to spur growth. Retain consultants to assess, train and coach existing management.</strong>Ken A. Stiefler, CExP&trade;, describes how he worked with one of his Exit Planning clients. &ldquo;This owner brought me in when he recognized two things about himself: too much of the business revolved around him, and he wasn&rsquo;t capable of taking the business to the next level. In an effort to change his role, the owner began planning to replace himself by: 1) bringing in a new general manager (instead of simply delegating to existing management), 2) creating a plan to delegate his responsibilities, over time, to others in the company and 3) looking at outsourcing some tasks.&rdquo;##TRENDING##Exit Planning advisors like Ken have resources and a stable of outside talent on call to resolve issues that existing management or advisors cannot.<strong> Task 3. You must provide the leadership and motivate top management to achieve the goals you&rsquo;ve described in your growth plan. Providing strong incentives to management is one of the key components private equity firms create for newly acquired companies.</strong>As an owner who is building transferable value you must add this component: When designing incentive plans for your management team, be mindful of the need to retain management beyond your departure as active owner.There are two parts to this component. First, when you provide top managers financial incentives designed to grow cash flow or business value they are motivated to help you to achieve your exit goals. Second, these incentives can also motivate management to remain after you exit, and management must stay in the business when you leave if it is to continue to thrive. If your company fails to thrive after you leave it, you are not likely going to achieve your values-based goals. And, it&rsquo;s unlikely you will receive the balance of the purchase price you were expecting after you sell the company.<h3> Incentive Plans Motivate Key Employees</h3>Perhaps the most common tool used to motivate management is a &ldquo;non-qualified deferred compensation plan,&rdquo; or NQDC Plan. For the sake of brevity, the NQDC Plan includes two elements, a benefit formula and a vesting schedule.##PAGE_BREAK##The benefit formula typically contains a performance benchmark that motivates participating key employees to increase the profitability or cash flow goals of your company. The employees usually receive a cash award. Usually about half of the award is paid in cash each year if cash flow or profitability reaches or exceeds the pre-determined benchmark. The remaining half of the award is deferred and subject to vesting. Unless the business or key employee reaches the benchmark, the key employee receives no award. These plans are designed to encourage your management team to achieve the very growth goals necessary for you to reach your financial security goals.The vesting schedule is similar in concept to the vesting schedules used in many qualified retirement plans such as 401(k) or defined benefit plans. Like many qualified plans, a key employee is vested in the benefit over a number of years. If that employee leaves before becoming fully vested, they forfeit part or all of the accrued benefit.Incentive plans for key employees (management) are widely used in Exit Planning. (Examples and additional explanation to follow in future posts.) Their near- universal usage is understandable: To create transferable value, someone other than you needs to be similarly motivated to grow value and the cash flow necessary to achieve your exit goals and continue the company beyond you. That &ldquo;someone&rdquo; must be, can only be, your management team.Look again at Peter Drucker&rsquo;s recommendation. Unless you &ldquo;build a top level management team before [your company] reaches the point where it must have one&rdquo; your company will not be the great, durable enterprise it must be to enable you to exit it when you want, for the money to need, in the hands of the successor of your choice.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-20 15:05:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-20 15:05:14.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_1Kdx7HD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/next-level-management-the-mother-of-all-value-drivers/\", \"post_id\": \"12614\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-20 15:05:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-20 15:05:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"next-level-management-the-mother-of-all-value-drivers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12613\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6127\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/next-level-management-mother-all-value-drivers.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1013\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469095200,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

This contract also gives you the right to partake in a class-action suit against your advisor if the conflicted product is not ultimately in your best interest.</p><h3> What to Ask Before the Switch <br/>  </h3><p> If you employ a traditional financial advisor who was not previously bound to a fiduciary standard, there is a very good chance your money is part of the $1.7 trillion losing returns because of conflicted advice. And when your advisor comes to you to &ldquo;repaper&rdquo;, i.e. have you sign a BICE or any other paperwork related to their switch to a fiduciary, you should find out how much your advisor was making from commissions on products that may not have been in your best interest.</p><p> Traditional advisors are worried about you saying, &ldquo;hold on a second&rdquo; when they begin compliance with the fiduciary rule. During the campaign against the DoL rule, Paul Reilly, CEO of traditional financial advisory company Raymond James, encouraged Raymond James employees to go on record opposing the fiduciary standard. Additionally, if an advisor is planning to transition, many are scrambling to do so before November 11th, after which FINRA will notify all of their clients of the transition and encourage clients to ask what it means for them financially.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Now that the fiduciary rule is going into effect, firms like Raymond James are sweating the switch to fee-only fiduciary accounts and increased oversight of their activities by regulators.</p><p> Make sure you&rsquo;re prepared for that conversation with your advisor by reading my previous article, 6 Questions to Ask Your Financial Advisor. If you learn that you are one of the many, many investors losing 12% due to conflicted advice and want to work with an advisor who will work only in your best interest, you may want to schedule an appointment with an advisor that doesn&rsquo;t have such conflicts. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-20 15:10:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-20 15:10:49.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_MvUfUCe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-to-you-need-to-know-about-advisors-repapering-your-account/\", \"post_id\": \"12618\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-20 15:10:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-20 15:10:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-to-you-need-to-know-about-advisors-repapering-your-account\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12617\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6129\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-you-need-know-about-advisors-repapering-your-account.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1435\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469120400,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

She told me how her 55-year-old cousin is worried about her husband leaving her, and this would put her in a vulnerable financial position. She&rsquo;s thinking about retiring in the next five years, but is afraid to because her income would drop dramatically.</p><p> As a money coach, I hear about this kind of dilemma all the time, and honestly, it breaks my heart. It is stories like this that compel me to do the work I do. Women who find themselves in this type of predicament are the very reason I&rsquo;m so passionate about this topic.</p><p> My vision is that women would step into their financial empowerment &ndash; whether they are married or single. I want every woman to heal her relationship with money and learn to become financially literate and confident with money. I would love to see women embrace their money power, which means her financial security would be in her control, not someone else&rsquo;s.</p><p> When women learn to get their money story handled it also means they can reduce their bag lady fears about outliving their money in retirement (a fear that plagues women at all income levels).</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Unfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t until women reach their fifties that they even begin to realize the financial challenges that await them in retirement.

This is your financial wellbeing we&rsquo;re talking about. That deserves your undivided attention and focus. Take the time to organize your financial documents, and get a handle on your money.</li><li> Find the money. Think about how you can reduce your current monthly expenses, so you can increase the amount of money you put into savings. It&rsquo;s not about how much you make but how much you keep that determines how much you can save.</li><li> Increase your financial literacy.

{"original_id":5883,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Step-By-Step Rebranding Strategy for Professional Services","link":"a-step-by-step-rebranding-strategy-for-professional-services","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There are many reasons why a professional services firm might consider rebranding. Most of them are firmly rooted in a need to reposition the firm in the marketplace. </p><p> It could be as simple as the merger of two firms or as complex as a major shift in target clients or business strategy. But whatever the reason, a firm eventually faces the question of how to rebrand in a way that yields the desired business result.</p><p> That is what we are going to cover. What is the right strategy to rebrand your professional services firm? </p><h3> 1. Start With the Business Reason <br/>  </h3><p> Any rebranding strategy should start with a thorough understanding of the business reason behind the rebranding. Is it driven by a need to accelerate growth? Does your firm need to compete with larger, more established competitors?</p><p> Some of these business cases are very easy to make, such as a merger of two firms. Others are more subtle, such as outgrowing your image. If you are not clear about the business reason driving the effort, you run the risk of wasting a tremendous amount of resources. Some of the other top reasons to rebrand your professional services firm includes:</p><li> You need to compete at a higher level or in a new market.</li><li> Your brand no longer reflects who you are.</li><li> Your firm is spun off from an existing brand.</li><li> You have a legal reason compelling you to change.</li><li> You need to simplify and focus your message.</li><li> You have a new marketing team.</li><li> You are launching a new service line.</li><h3> 2. Research Your Firm and Your Target Clients <br/>  </h3><p> When you are clear on the business case for a rebranding, the next step is to conduct independent research on your firm and your clients. If you are attempting to move into a new market, that research should include your new target clients as well. The goal is to have an objective understanding of your current brand perception and competencies.</p><p> Without this research, you will be operating from an internal perspective only. Our own research on professional services buyers and sellers shows that virtually all firms have blind spots and distort how the marketplace sees them. After all, we are all human. Without objective research, you will build a brand on false assumptions.</p><h3> 3. Use Positioning and Messaging to Capture Your Brand Strategy <br/>  </h3><p> As you develop your firm&rsquo;s market positionng and messaging architecture, you will uncover the essence of your brand strategy. Your market positioning is a brief description of where you fit into the market space. Are you an innovative leader or a low cost provider?</p><p> This positioning will drive many of your subsequent decisions. But you can&rsquo;t just make something up. It needs to balance who you are as a firm and who you want to become. You must be able to support your positioning or your brand will be hollow.</p><p> Your messaging architecture articulates your messages to each of your main audiences. These messages must be consistent with your overall brand and supportable. This is not marketing copy. It is the skeleton upon which marketing copy is built.</p><h3> 4. Build Your Brand Identity <br/>  </h3><p> This is the part of the rebranding strategy where you develop the visual elements that will communicate your brand. Think firm name, logo, tagline, colors, business card design, stationary, and the like. These elements are often described in a brand style guidelines document, which provides a set of parameters to ensure your brand is implemented consistently across all of your marketing materials.</p><p> Many folks confuse these elements with your brand. Your brand is your reputation and your visibility, not your firm&rsquo;s name or its logo. Your brand identity is a sort of visual shorthand for your brand.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 5. Build Your Website and Online Presence <br/>  </h3><p> Your website is your single most important communication and business development tool. It is the place where you can tell a compelling story to each of your audiences. It is the first place a prospective client or employee will turn to learn more about your firm.</p><p> It is no exaggeration to say that a website and your online presence are the heart of a modern professional services firm. All rebranding strategies eventually involve your website. In a very real way, a website is built on the framework of your messaging architecture. Together with your remaining online presence (think social media, for example), it is the full expression of your positioning.</p><h3> 6. Marketing Collateral <br/>  </h3><p> At this point in your rebranding strategy, you will develop all of the marketing materials that you need to communicate your brand and services messages. Think pitch decks, proposal templates, brochures, one-sheet fliers and trade show booths.</p><p> These are the tools that you will use to communicate your message. They should be firmly anchored in your brand strategy.</p><h3> 7. Brand Building Plan <br/>  </h3><p> The final element of your rebranding strategy is to develop a plan to promote and strengthen your new brand. How will you launch it internally? In professional services, it is essential that your employees embrace the new brand. After all, they are your product.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also important that you build the brand in a way that communicates your firm&rsquo;s reputation and expertise, as well as its name. It must communicate your market positioning. Brand building is different for professional services.</p><p> Some rebranding strategies fail because they try to shortcut the process.

We know that it is a great solution to organically grow the business, raise brand awareness, nurture customers, and continue to add value to our audiences.</p><p> So why does it continue to be an up-hill battle to convince the CEOs and employees that this is a really, really, REALLY good thing?! In this post, I&rsquo;ll unpack some of the common objections against content marketing by c-suites and then offer some really simple, yet effective tactics to use to get the internal buy-in for content marketing.</p><p> <strong>  Statements like the following are fairly common and shouldn&rsquo;t surprise any marketer. We should all be prepared to address these objections and offer creative solutions in response: </strong></p><li> Our business thrives on word-of-mouth referrals; we don&rsquo;t need a blog or any of that.</li><li> Our audience isn&rsquo;t on social media.</li><li> What&rsquo;s content marketing and how would I use that for my business?</li><li> We don&rsquo;t have a big enough marketing budget or the right internal resources to sustain content marketing efforts.</li><li> It&rsquo;s a nice idea, but a discretionary expense we&rsquo;d sooner put towards other marketing expenditures that have quicker results like Facebook ads and PPC campaigns.</li><p> <strong>  Generally speaking, objections tend to either fall in one or a combination of these three categories: </strong></p><li> Rejection of new methods and technologies</li><li> Lack of education or understanding</li><li> Cost or expense in dollars and resources</li><p> All of these challenges are valid and are easy enough to address.  Knowing how to address these objections and with whom is the key to secure internal buy-in for your content marketing efforts.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s what you need to know and organize before you even start the conversation with your C-Suite: </strong></p><li> Why are you recommending content marketing strategies for the business? What is your vision? Be sure you can align your reasons with overall company goals. Connect the dots with how this strategy works to achieve the goals and results the business has prioritized.</li><li> What is the projected impact?  Prepare your research and personalize it to your industry and your company as best you can. What KPIs will you measure in order to show progress towards overall company goals based on incremental content marketing goals over what period of time? Need some data? This here is a gold mine from Hubspot. Content Marketing Institute should also be your go-to resource for research and industry data.</li><li> What kind of resources is it going to take in order to be successful?  Break it down into hard and soft figures in time and money.</li><li> Who needs to be involved and at what level?  This will vary by company, so think carefully whose talent and effort you need for the strategy to be successful.</li><li> How is the process going to work?  If your business isn&rsquo;t already doing content marketing, you&rsquo;ll need to design a process to follow in order to stay on schedule, facilitate collaboration, and get the necessary approvals.</li><li> What or Who presents your greatest barriers to success?  Know who your nay-sayers are and/or what challenges you know you may face, such as needing to buy new technology or some cultural factors. Be prepared with how you plan to nip resistance in the bud.</li><li> Who will be your advocates and supporters of the content marketing strategy?  Know who they are and keep them close.</li><li> Who benefits from content marketing, internal and external, and why?  Be prepared to talk specifics.</li><li> What are the risks?  What does the company have to lose if the strategy doesn&rsquo;t go as planned&hellip; What does the company have to lose if the strategy never gets implemented?</li><p> Through answering all of these questions above, you prepare yourself to address the issues that matter to the C-Suite, whether it&rsquo;s the CEO, CFO or CMO: Time, Money, Impact and Results.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Honestly, the easier you can make it for them to understand, the better chance you have to get their support and buy-in. Furthermore, arming yourself with the knowledge will allow you to speak intelligently and keep the conversation focused.</p><p> Prepare all this information and have a very clear sense of your company&rsquo;s particular landscape for content marketing. It is also a good idea to share ongoing marketing education around the office. The more you focus on adding value to the customer and less about traditional demarcations of roles and responsibilities, the more meaningful and genuine these efforts become for everyone.</p><p> Share your vision with your colleagues and help them personalize it. Think of the people you will need to implement your content strategy, like content matter experts, proof readers, or social brand ambassadors. If you can get them excited about content marketing and how their contributions as a team lead to customer value, you can make your recommendations to your C-Suite with even more confidence knowing that you have the right people&rsquo;s buy-in who will actually be helping you do it.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Having the conversation to get buy-in <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;ve done all your prep work, feel really comfortable with your recommendation and have begun casual conversations on the subject so that there is some familiarity across the organization about content marketing. Now, you&rsquo;re ready to have a formal conversation to adopt a content marketing strategy. Remember, this should play out more like a conversation than a pitch and be sure to listen carefully to everything your CEO has to say. Schedule time to discuss content marketing with the CEO and be prepared to send him any details he requests in advance. Remember to approach this particular conversation as an opportunity to offer something helpful and valuable to the business and be careful not to become defensive or aggressive if you are met with some resistance. Instead, calmly offer another way to look at the situation in question and always remain respectful.</p><p> <strong>  Other tips for having a successful conversation for CEO buy-in includes: </strong></p><li> Begin from a place of mutual understanding. Talk about shared vision and how you&rsquo;re working to achieve this through your role.</li><li> Be extremely self-aware. Be aware of your tone and body language and try as best you can to accommodate your CEO&rsquo;s personality type and how they like to receive information. Don&rsquo;t get lost in details unless they ask. Be ready to adjust your manner if you can sense displeasure.</li><li> Listen by asking the right questions. This is a conversation and by asking the right questions, you can learn so much of what you need to know and comfortably contribute with your perspective as well.</li><li> Be agreeable even if you disagree. Even if you don&rsquo;t agree, agree in the sense that you understand their objection, but would like to offer another way to look at it (whatever the issue is).</li><li> Ask permission. Respect is everything and you are showing that respect by asking permission from a position of credibility.</li><li> Demonstrate your credibility. Without being a fact-dropper, share the compelling data that supports your position and why this is a good thing for the business.</li><li> Create familiarity. It is sometimes better to let it be the CEO&rsquo;s idea instead of your own. Highlight the things that the business is already doing well as it relates to content marketing or cite known businesses or competitors who are doing it and what can be learned from them.</li><li> Summary and next steps. Always offer next steps based on the discussion. He may need more information, want to discuss with his partners, think about it, or have a follow-up conversation in a week.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t give up. Even if you don&rsquo;t get the green light to go forth with content marketing after this initial conversation, the seed has been planted. Understand where the conversation stands and what, if anything, you may be able to do to start a process or revisit the discussion again.</li><p> As content marketers, you know it is all about providing value to your audience and focusing on relationships. May your efforts in securing internal buy-in for content marketing efforts reflect the same care, precision, and intentionality that goes into the great work you do.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-20 15:19:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-20 15:19:53.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_HzBaxUI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-solve-the-biggest-problems-with-content-marketing-buy-in/\", \"post_id\": \"12624\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-20 15:19:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-20 15:19:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-solve-the-biggest-problems-with-content-marketing-buy-in\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12623\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6133\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-solve-biggest-problems-content-marketing-buy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"698\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469116800,"author_id":311,"chart_url":""}

Old Billy Shakespeare said a long time ago, &ldquo;All the world&rsquo;s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.&rdquo; He nailed it.</p><p> The problem is we don&rsquo;t realize we&rsquo;re on stage. We don&rsquo;t realize that, (especially if we&rsquo;re in a leadership position) we&rsquo;re always being watched. That everything we do and everything we say communicates who we are and what we&rsquo;re about. And while we may think that we&rsquo;ve landed the role of &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; or &ldquo;Executive&rdquo; or &ldquo;Manager&rdquo; or &ldquo;Director&rdquo; or &ldquo;Supervisor&rdquo; or &ldquo;VP&rdquo; or &ldquo;Consultant&rdquo;, or whatever our title may be, the truth is, we&rsquo;re always auditioning.</p><p> Auditioning stinks. It&rsquo;s one of those necessary evils that actors know they must learn to embrace or they need to get out of the business. If you&rsquo;re an actor and you want to participate in a production, you&rsquo;re required to audition. Depending on the show, you and several-hundred-to-several-thousand-other-actors must take the stage for a whopping 2-3 minutes, and do everything you can to make a lasting impression on the director. Just in hopes to participate.In the theatre world, typically less than 5% of the actors who audition are cast. In the business world, the odds are only slightly better. But actors do have something going for them that leaders don&rsquo;t. Actors know for certain when they&rsquo;ve been cast. As Leaders we often think we&rsquo;ve been cast.</p><p> I remember a boss early in my career&hellip;.we&rsquo;ll just call her &ldquo;Boss-zilla&rdquo;. She had a fancy title and lots of power. We all did what she told us to do (albeit with much grumbling behind the scenes). We had a team of very smart, talented, passionate, driven people (Boss-zilla knew how to hire). And every person on our team kept their ideas, passion, energy, and enthusiasm locked up tight in their own personal vault. Every person on our team had their resume in circulation and &ldquo;exited stage right&rdquo; as soon as they possibly could. While we reported to her, not one person on our team had cast Boss-zilla as their leader.  Ours was simply a paycheck-exchange.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Often as leaders we have the title. Often as leaders people do what we tell them to do. But in order to truly lead, we need people to want to follow. &ldquo;To want&rdquo; is a heart decision. As leaders we have to be able to tap into the hearts as well as the minds of the people we lead to gain access to the stuff that can really make a difference in our businesses:  ideas, passion, energy, excitement, enthusiasm, caring, loyalty.</p><p> Today I challenge you to ask yourself the tough questions:</p><li> Have you been cast in the hearts and minds of the people you lead?</li><li> In the hearts and the minds of your colleagues?</li><li> In the hearts and the minds of your clients?</li><li> How do you know?</li><li> What do you DO to ensure that people want to follow you?</li><p> And what are you leaving on the table, if you&rsquo;ve not really been cast where it counts? Ideas. Passion. Energy. Excitement. Enthusiasm. Caring. Loyalty. Investments of the heart.

{"original_id":5886,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Ways to Boost Your Financial Future After Your Child Graduates From College","link":"7-ways-to-boost-your-financial-future-after-your-child-graduates-from-college","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> <strong>  Congratulations! After years of hard work, your child has just received their college diploma.  </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> You are breathing a sigh of relief as you are off the hook for all of those years of tuition payments. Hopefully your child is also in the process of securing a full-time job and coming off the family payroll for good. </p><p> As you move into this next phase of life there are several things you should do to take advantage of this transition:</p><h3> 1. Review your tax withholdings: <br/>  </h3><p> If your child graduated in May and is starting a full-time job, it&rsquo;s likely you will no longer be able to claim them as a dependent on your tax return this year. This is a loss of $4k in exemptions ($8k if you have twins!). You should review your current income tax situation with your CPA or financial advisor. Additional pre-tax contributions to your retirement accounts may offset some of this tax impact, but if you are already maxing your contributions, then an adjustment may be necessary to avoid a tax surprise next April.</p><h3> 2. Help your child start their career on the right foot: <br/>  </h3><p> The life of a new college graduate is very exciting. Education has opened the door to a world of possibility.  While their starting salary may not seem high, the money choices they make now will have lasting effects.  Investors in this demographic have the most powerful tool on their side: time. Help your child sort through their employee benefits package and begin contributions to their retirement account.  We have met with many of our clients adult children in this phase of their life. A gift of an hour or two with a financial planner may be all it takes to help them decide how much to defer to their retirement accounts, live within their means, and feel in control of their financial future.</p><h3> 3. Consider an investment in their future instead of monetary or tangible gifts: <br/>  </h3><p> Upon graduation it is customary to give gifts. Typically these range from cash to cars, trips, or in extravagant cases maybe even a house or condo.  While any gift is generous, you might consider rewarding your child&rsquo;s hard work with contributions to a Roth IRA. These are a great tool as most starting salaries will fall within eligibility for making full contributions and contributions can be withdrawn at any time tax and penalty free.  These make the accounts extremely flexible for young people as they can withdraw their contributions in a few years for a first home purchase or allow them to grow completely tax-free for retirement or other future needs.  Of course before giving a significant gift you should read tip # 4 to make sure it won&rsquo;t jeopardize your retirement.</p><h3> 4. Take a look at your retirement picture: <br/>  </h3><p> Now is a great time to revisit your long-term goals and determine where you stand. You may have had to put off or decrease your retirement contributions to pay for college expenses.  Don&rsquo;t let that extra cash go straight to new expenses or start building in your bank account!  This is a unique opportunity to start paying yourself first.</p><h3> 5. Ramp up retirement savings: <br/>  </h3><p> If you are not maxing contributions to your 401k, now is the perfect time to start. If you are over age 50 you are also eligible to make catch-up contributions.  These are a great way to get yourself back on track for your goals and boost your retirement income.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 6. Review your estate picture: <br/>  </h3><p> Now that your child is no longer a minor you should review any trust provisions you have in place and consider if they are still warranted or if you should change any of your beneficiary designations. Your child may or may not be mature enough now to inherit funds outright.  This is something to consider.  Estate goals are also very situation specific, so you should consult with your financial planner and attorney before making any changes.</p><h3> 7. Review your Life Insurance Coverage: <br/>  </h3><p> When you were supporting young children and had many working years ahead of you the need for life insurance was likely great. Hopefully you have been building net worth over the course of your career in preparation for retirement.

{"original_id":5887,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"12 Tips to Effectively Communicate with a Gen Zer","link":"12-tips-to-effectively-communicate-with-a-gen-zer","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There&rsquo;s a 5th generation in the workplace wings. Sometimes when giving a talk I am asked about the generation following Gen Y/Millennials. What are they like? What do we call them? <br/>  </h3><p> So far there is no consensus on one name for this generation. Labels floating around are: Generation Z (coming after Gen X and Y); the Plurals (having a multitude of interests); and the Re Generation (as in do-overs). For simplicity I will refer to them as Gen Z. they are generally defined today as high school and young college students.</p><p> Below I summarize some useful observations and 12 tips and give my interpretation of comparisons with other generational cohorts and of some of the findings from research by Sparks &amp; Honey as well as NPD Group, Millennial Branding and Martin-Wilbourne Partners and cited in an article by Business Insider. Since this very large cohort born after the mid-1990s is mostly not yet in the workplace except as interns and in retail, the early research findings on attitudes and behaviors are likely to be modified. However they are worth considering now as we prepare for an influx in four or five years so as not to be taken by surprise.</p><p> We have been hearing a lot about how Gen Y wants to change the world, but that is even more an aspiration or intention of Gen Z (60% vs. 39%). Already 25% of them volunteer for some cause. 72% of them want to be entrepreneurs &ndash; 61% of them soon after college. The Gen Zers are even more constantly connected digitally than the Yers. While they are collaborative, their preference is to work independently &ndash; more like Gen Xers than the Gen Y/Millenials. They are into self-help in whatever they want to do. I guess they think they can Google or otherwise search for anything online. This suggests that the freelance mentality is alive and well in this youngest generation, something employers have to think about in terms of restructuring how work gets done.</p><p> In communication, they seem to favor even fewer than 140 characters, going for images when possible &ndash; emoticons, photos, symbols. The rapid and imprecise messages can often be open to misinterpretation. With lack of concern for grammar and punctuation and multi-cultural influences, things can get confusing or annoying to older generations who had to learn grammar, spelling and punctuation.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Like Gen Yers, the Zers are generally close to their families and greatly influenced by them. Will &ldquo;helicopter parenting&rdquo; continue to infiltrate the workplace? This should not be surprising as the parents are most likely to be Gen Xers, who are quite family-focused because they might not have had that attention from their Traditionalist and older Boomer parents who were busy working hard without employer support for flexibility.</p><p> This is just a start on deciphering the attitudes and behaviors of the generation coming to your workplace in a few years if not sooner.</p><p> From what marketing agency Sparks &amp; Honey recommends to effectively communicate with a Gen Zer (born after 1990), I have drafted a dozen tips for you:</p><li> Communicate in short bursts with images, symbols and videos</li><li> Take care in interpreting and respect their opinions on a wide variety of topics</li><li> Feed their curiosity</li><li> Help them build their expertise</li><li> Don&rsquo;t talk down to them; talk with them as adults</li><li> Tap into their entrepreneurial spirit and industriousness</li><li> Collaborate with them and build together</li><li> Give them responsibility</li><li> Talk with them about value &ndash; they are cost conscious</li><li> Don&rsquo;t expect brand loyalty</li><li> Work with them on social causes or support theirs</li><li> Show interest in sustainability of the earth, products and practices</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-20 15:25:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-20 15:25:51.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_GN8fval.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/12-tips-to-effectively-communicate-with-a-gen-zer/\", \"post_id\": \"12630\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-20 15:25:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-20 15:25:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"12-tips-to-effectively-communicate-with-a-gen-zer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12629\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6136\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12-tips-effectively-communicate-gen-zer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"860\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469088000,"author_id":388,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5888,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Lean Leadership: Analyzing Toyota's Management Philosophy and Best Practices","link":"lean-leadership-analyzing-toyotas-management-philosophy-and-best-practices","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Recently I came across the Japanese terms genchi genbutsu and genba; they're both key principles of the Toyota Production System, which comprises Toyota's management philosophy and best practices. <br/>  </h3><p> While they are (lean) management principles/concepts, they apply not only to the employee experience but also to the customer experience. Let's look at some background and definitions first. <br/> <br/> Toyota's website defines genchi genbutsu as: going to the source to find the facts to make correct decisions, build consensus and achieve goals. <br/> <br/> According to Wikipedia, genchi genbutsu means \"go and see.\" It suggests that in order to truly understand a situation one needs to go to genba, or the 'real place' - where work is done. <br/> <br/> According to iSixSigma: The idea behind genchi genbutsu is that business decisions need to be based on first-hand knowledge, not the understanding of another person which might be biased, outdated, or incorrect. Problems are best understood and solved where they occur -&ndash; for example, on the factory floor. Rather than looking at information from a distance &ndash;- in an office, for example &ndash;- regarding process issues, managers should go see for themselves what is happening. <br/> <br/> As you read those definitions, I hope you did what I did when I first read them: I nodded my head and thought that these had great application to the world of customer experience. How do you get to the root of the problem, effort, or issue without getting your hands dirty and seeing it for yourself?  <br/> <br/> Six Sigma Training writes: If you&rsquo;re ready to find and eliminate the sources of inefficiency and poor quality that could prove lethal for your business, it&rsquo;s time to &ldquo;get your boots on:&rdquo; genchi genbutsu. If boots aren&rsquo;t your style, genchi genbutsu can also be translated as &ldquo;go and see for yourself.&rdquo; According to The Economist, &ldquo;genchi genbutsu represents a fundamental difference between western and Japanese management styles&mdash;whereas in the West knowledge is gleaned and digested in the office or the boardroom, in Japan it is gleaned on the factory floor.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The concept can easily be generalized beyond manufacturing; the essence of genchi genbutsu is simply this: optimal decision-making requires that you physically go to the relevant place (gemba) to observe the relevant objects (genbutsu) yourself.  In fact, the term gemba itself is commonly used instead of genchi genbutsu, because the entirety of this concept is actually captured by the idea of place&mdash;being on the spot, at the source of the action, to identify and take advantage of opportunities for improvement. <br/> <br/> Note: Gemba is the romanized version of genba. <br/> <br/> As The Economist article states, genchi genbutsu is a frame of mind more than it is an action plan. I like this frame of mind, and it's one senior management should absolutely adopt. Many compare it to \"management by walking around.\" You cannot manage or run a business sitting in your ivory tower. You cannot manage or run a business by simply looking at numbers, metrics, data, and reports. You have to go down in the trenches and see the work being done. This isn't about micro-managing; this is about knowing your business, knowing how things are done, and experiencing firsthand what employees do and experience. I've watched a lot of episodes of Undercover Boss, and it really does baffle me that executives have no idea what their employees do.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK## <br/> <br/> I started to think about some of the things companies can do to move from mindset to action. I think these apply to both the employee experience and the customer experience. </p><li> Customer immersion programs: executives are embedded into their customers' lives to gain a better understanding of how they live, work, and do the jobs they need to do. Adobe's immersion program is well known in the industry.</li><li> Ethnography research: anthropological researchers (you have one or two of these folks in your company, right?) visit customers in their homes or offices and observe how they live, act, and behave. Intel uses this approach.</li><li> Management by walking around: managers wander through the workplace, checking on employees at random, to talk to them about how things are going and what issues they are facing at the moment.</li><li> Reverse mentoring: this can be used for a variety of reasons, but it also applies to helping senior leaders learn and understand the roles and tasks of their team members.</li><li> Undercover executive programs: you know this one because of the popular show, but your executives can do the same thing: go undercover and do the jobs your employees do so that they can get the real experience without being treated differently.</li><li> Doing the job: some companies assign executives to take on a different role within the organization once a month (not undercover) to experience the jobs their employees do.</li><li> Journey mapping: I often write about starting with assumptive maps, but another approach to mapping is to get out there with your customers and do the jobs they are trying to do; capture the steps, the emotions, the desired outcomes, and more.</li><li> Double jacking/call monitoring: this is a very-specific/tactical example of how to uncover customer support call issues or to help others understand both the customer and the employee experience for this type of interaction and role. An employee sits with a customer service rep and listens to customer calls.</li><li> Mystery shopping: shop your own organization; you don't have to be a retail operation to do this. \"Shopping\" can be calling your customer support line or your reception/main office line. Shopping can take many forms, and it allows you to experience the organization as customers would.</li><p> As you're undertaking these exercises, remember that there are different employee and customer types. People are different, and so their experiences are, too. For example, you can't forget that the experience for a disabled customer or employee, e.g., perhaps in a wheelchair, will be completely different from the customer or employee who is not disabled. Experience it all. <br/> <br/> If you want to put a label or category on each of these exercises, I'd simply call them \"Walking in Your Customers' (or Employees') Shoes.\" In reality, they are all different ways of doing the same thing and getting to the same outcomes: developing empathy, clarity, understanding, and awareness; understanding jobs to be done and how those are going; learning; identifying issues (effort, efficiency, effectiveness) and root causes; helping others; developing appreciation for what they are doing or trying to do; and more. <br/> <br/> With that information, with that knowledge, leaders can formulate improvement plans and then execute.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-20 15:28:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-20 15:28:46.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/lean-leadership-analyzing-toyotas-management-philosophy-and-best-practices.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/lean-leadership-analyzing-toyotas-management-philosophy-and-best-practices/\", \"post_id\": \"12632\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-20 15:28:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-20 15:28:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"lean-leadership-analyzing-toyotas-management-philosophy-and-best-practices\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12631\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6137\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lean-leadership-analyzing-toyotas-management-philosophy-and-best-practices.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1647\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469113200,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5889,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"'Dividend' and Conquer: Dividend-Focused Index Investing Outperforms","link":"dividend-and-conquer-dividend-focused-index-investing-outperforms","source_link":null,"content":"<p> By Nasdaq Global Information Services</p><h3> New Research Shows that Dividend-Focused Stocks Bring High Performance and Low Volatility</h3><p> <br/> As we&rsquo;ve seen with the aftermath of the U.K.&rsquo;s Brexit vote, one event can drive volatility in the markets quickly and significantly. Those who play the market understand that there is risk inherent in all investments, however, one asset class has both outperformed its peers and offers a continuous relative safe haven in times of volatility, and that is dividend-focused index funds.</p><p> Indexes constructed with dividend-paying stocks are some of the first significant building blocks of the <a href=\"http://business.nasdaq.com/intel/indexes/smart-beta/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  smart beta </a> market, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why they continue to be popular. In today&rsquo;s very low-interest rate and volatile investment climate, investors are continually attracted to strategies that are low-volatility, high performance and high quality. A dividend-based index hits all of these points.</p><p> Dividend-focused indexes are comprised of securities from public companies that pay dividends to shareholders (see <a href=\"http://business.nasdaq.com/intel/indexes/equity/dividend-and-income/dividend-achievers/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nasdaq Dividend Achievers  TM </a> ). There are several advantages to this approach that help insulate these funds from volatility. These companies are typically older, more established and have stood the test of time. The fact that they pay regular dividends to shareholders attests to both their stability as a company and to their cash position at any given moment. A company that is prepared to send cash to its shareholders is less likely to take unmitigated risks and is more likely to have substantial cash on hand.</p><p> A dividend track record correlates to low volatility. In both five-year and year-to-date reviews of dividend-based indexes versus non-dividend-based indexes, the dividend side outperforms. Specifically, the <a href=\"https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/Overview/DAY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers&trade; 50 Index </a> (DAY) had a lower annualized volatility (14.5%) compared with the S&amp;P 500 (15.7%) over the last five years. It also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility High Dividend (107.1% vs. 94.8%) and the Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Total Return Index (107.1&amp; vs. 79.4%) over that same period. Both of those competing indexes are based on a one-year trailing yield rather than a long historical track record of dividend payments. In short: the more dividend distribution, the sweeter the volatility cushion.</p><p> <a href=\"https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/docs/Research_DAY.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Read our entire DAY research report here </a> .</p><p> Successive volatile trading environments have put stocks and index investing to the test. Dividend-paying stock index investing has demonstrated its track record as a top performer and sound port of call during volatile times.</p><p> For more information about Nasdaq Dividend Indexes or any of our indexes, <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/GIG_ContactUs?source=OtherWebsite&amp;sd=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  click here </a> and a member of our team will contact you.</p>Nasdaq&reg; is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.

And, since your kids may still be at camp, there's time to indulge in a few summertime fantasies before they get home. </h3><p> <br/> No need to download Pokemon Go as augmented reality isn't what we're talking about here. You're after the connection that comes from real time spent in the sandbox, so to speak. Hey, when is the last time you actually got on a swing? That's a stress reliever, trust me!</p><p> So if the swings aren't your thing, what's next? </p><h3> <b>  Nature </b></h3><p> <br/> A big advantage of sunshine and warm weather means you can spend more time outside. Nature nurtures, which actually makes a lot of sense, as you immediately begin to feel more calm and connected. You breathe a little deeper, the anxiety begins to dissipate and your stress level decreases. So let the outdoors give you a giant hug as you hike or bike, swim or swing. </p><h3> <b>  Board Games  </b></h3><p> <br/> If you live in a part of the world where the seasons are reversed, or maybe you're in the hurricane belt so the weather isn't cooperating, you can still connect to some indoor fun. When is the last time you invited friends and family over to play some good old fashioned board games? Get out that deck of cards, the war torn monopoly board or choose to invest in a game you wanted to play as a kid and never had the opportunity to do. Now is your chance!    </p><h3> <b>  Focus on Food </b></h3><p> <br/> Summertime gives us a wonderful opportunity to explore new and different types of food. Do you know what a ramp is, or have you ever seen one? It's true, most folks haven't. Head to the nearest farmer's market and explore new options for your dinner. Next step? Give yourself the opportunity to play outside on the grill. You don't have to be a top chef to have a little fun at the grill, although maybe a backyard cook-off with the neighbors is just what you need.  </p><p> Choose one or choose all but remember you've got about 6 weeks before summer says bye-bye. So make the commitment to be present and <i>  Consciously Connecting </i>  to the joys of summer!</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-21 13:45:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-21 13:45:35.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_tSZxZ79.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-ways-to-beat-summertime-blues/\", \"post_id\": \"12636\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-21 13:45:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-21 13:45:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-ways-to-beat-summertime-blues\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12635\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6139\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/3-ways-beat-summertime-blues.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1061\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469214000,"author_id":196,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5892,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Harvard Business Review: 3 Ways to Overachieve in Sales","link":"harvard-business-review-3-ways-to-overachieve-in-sales","source_link":null,"content":"<p> What makes successful salespeople successful? Some would say it&rsquo;s their charming ability to win over customers. Others would say it&rsquo;s their inherent drive to never give up. I would say it&rsquo;s whether or not they use an intelligent sales platform, like  <a href=\"http://deeplink.me/app.spirohq.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Spiro </a> . Well, we don&rsquo;t have to guess anymore, because a research study highlighted in the  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/06/a-portrait-of-the-overperforming-salesperson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Harvard Business Review  </a> has provided us with the answers.This article sums up the findings of a study conducted by Steve Martin, in which he interviewed 1,000 salespeople to find out what attributes all the top performers had in common. Three main things stuck out to me.</p><h3> 1) Get Motivated By Your Peers</h3>It is interesting to note, that although money plays an important role in motivating the top sales reps, a larger percentage of them (84%) said being recognized and respected by their peers was a motivating factor.Find a way to celebrate each other&rsquo;s successes, and when you are the one being celebrated, that will give you the extra motivation to keep going. Ring a bell every time a big deal comes in, or have a leaderboard of top sales reps streaming as your screensaver.There is even an app, called YouEarnedIt, where employees can give their co-workers virtual money for a good job, and then later on those top winners can cash it in for real prizes. Peer to peer recognition works, and the Harvard Business Review shows that research backs up the fact of its motivating powers.<h3> 2) Be Organized</h3>This group of salespeople who reach 125% of their quota time and time again, are not fly by the seat of their pants type of people. The research shows that they keep a list of tasks, think about their career and future, and are planners. Top performing salespeople tend to be take the bull by the horns people &ndash; they answered the survey saying that they went into sales to create their own destiny and because they knew that the harder they worked, the more money they could make.Find a way to get organized &ndash; take use of the tasks feature in Salesforce, or make a daily mental checklist of how many calls you want to get through before lunch. Set goals and then strategically work through them.My top recommendation would be to get a personal assistant, like<a href=\"http://deeplink.me/app.spirohq.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Spiro</a>, which will automatically create a list of next steps you need to take on all of your opportunities. Spiro knows the last time you met, called or emailed a prospect, and uses artificial intelligence to know when you should reach out next. We know the top sales reps are busy selling, so let Spiro help keep you organized!##TRENDING##<h3> 3) Emotionally Connect with Your Prospects</h3>The Harvard Business Review article then goes on to discuss the top performers&rsquo; strategies on getting their deals done. The leading answer was to find a way to emotionally connect with your customers. This response significantly outweighed driving the conversation or showing your product&rsquo;s value.  Getting the customer to like you, and then building trust by proving to them that you can help with their success is key here.The goal is to really connect with your clients, don&rsquo;t manipulate your customer or be sleazy. Go into a meeting with a smile on your face, remember their name, and always let them finish their thoughts. Find a common ground you can both emotionally relate to and then make a note of that, so you remember what is important to them.A friend once told me his company internally used to tell the sales reps, &ldquo;keep your friends close and your customers even closer&rdquo;.<h3> In Conclusion</h3>If you want to be a rockstar salesperson, you need to be motivated, organized, and connected with your customers. But how do these top reps view themselves? Is this how they would describe their characteristics?One of the most interesting parts of the study was asking this group of 1,000 sales professionals to describe how they saw themselves. For those not making quota, they answered with &ldquo;responsible, likable, confident..&rdquo;, while the 125% quota crushers, saw themselves as &ldquo;confident, X-factor, quick-witted&rdquo;.You can see a difference here &ndash; the top reps have confidence as the number one way others view them. Confidence is king in the game of sales!","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 17:28:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 17:28:36.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_iXWlbc2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/?p=12473\", \"post_id\": \"12473\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 10:28:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 17:28:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"harvard-business-review-3-ways-to-overachieve-in-sales\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8277\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6058\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-to-Build-a-Great-Organization-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"368\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"269\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-07-14\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1468503120,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Leverage is still spectacularly high both here and in Europe. The emerging markets, specifically China, are evolving into a state of debt overhang that will be problematic inevitably. The next crisis will begin in those emerging economies and the contagion will spread to the United States, a reversal of how the last one happened.</p><h3> And when it does hit, here&rsquo;s why we are going to be worse off than in 2008.</h3><p> <br/> One reason is that there are simply not many levers left to pull. What is the Fed going to do, keep printing trillions of dollars? We&rsquo;re already in an inflation death spiral. This could actually break our currency. Secondly, the source of up and coming prosperity is not equipped to handle another downturn. The Millennials, Generation X, and Generation Y (whatever you want to call them) have not yet shored up enough capital to survive another bout of unemployment. The boomers are retiring and who is going to buy their homes, their cars, their businesses?</p><p> The final factor is downright terrifying. Electronic currencies like Bitcoin are not regulated by the Central Bank. It&rsquo;s used for online payments between individuals &ndash; it&rsquo;s Internet money, so to speak. These transactions happen as fast as email and in a flash could accelerate the speed of crisis from a minor shock to an all out collapse. <br/> So what should everyday people be doing now to protect themselves in advance?</p><li> <strong>  The first thing is preparation of capital. </strong> Stow away as much cash in your 401(k)&rsquo;s, 529&rsquo;s, IRA&rsquo;s, savings accounts, etc., as you can and invest it as wisely as you can in income producing assets that will be recession proof. Think twice about gambling with your retirement money.</li><li> <strong>  Secondly, strive to earn as much as you can while you have a job. </strong> Now is not the time to be complacent. That doesn&rsquo;t mean to simply ask your boss for a raise. Find a way to get connected to a higher stream of income at your job, either by building more relationships, gaining new skills, or even switching employers.</li><li> <strong>  Diversify your income. Invent another form of income, perhaps by starting a small side business. </strong> Not just a hobby job, but a real revenue stream. As I state in my blog, &ldquo;The Unemployment Stopwatch&rdquo;, you may have to get sales training. The hardest thing for new entrepreneurs to do is to learn how to get people to part with their money. You may have to invest some money in a solid sales training course or two. Once you do that, however, you will gain the power to produce financial freedom for yourself.</li><li> <strong>  Watch your debt. </strong> Try to increase coverage levels (meaning, the ratio of unit of cash to unit of debt). Pay off debt as soon as you can and set aside extra cash to call on specifically for this purpose in case of a break in employment.</li><li> <strong>  Learn how to network using the Internet instead of in person. </strong> I mean, really network, as in building a following of tens of thousands of people. If I can upload a picture to Instagram and have 30 million people see it in four seconds, why would I bother going to BNI meetings in person anymore? This is a grandiose example, but if you look at the sheer numbers it is staggering to realize how much you are falling behind if you are not able to develop productive business relationships online.

You wear more hats than most people will purchase in a lifetime but most days you don&rsquo;t feel the weight because you are simply in go mode. You&rsquo;re moving, constantly. Between projects, task, responsibilities at work, home and ones not assigned to you that you simply jumped in and completed because you could. That&rsquo;s what you do. You fix things. Some of those things are people and sometimes they are fires that you craft a way to put out.</p><p> Is this your life? Is this the balance that everyone keeps hemming and hawing about? Are your days are meant to be spent between other people&rsquo;s problems, firefighting and fixing? What about your dreams? How much longer do you have to defer them because you don&rsquo;t have time to gather all the ingredients you need to make it rise? How are you ever going to have enough energy to get over to it? You&rsquo;re not new to this, you know the space between I can and I will is a windy, twisty and sometimes dirty road. The terrain isn&rsquo;t pretty and you need a well-equipped vehicle to get you through it. You also know that you can&rsquo;t keep moving at this pace, working so hard with i nequitable results. Meanwhile, everywhere you turn there are people, places and things tugging at you and all of your resources.</p><p> So where do you start?</p><h3> <strong>  First things First </strong> . Make a commitment to Get Bold!</h3><p> <br/> There are 2 Major Steps and 2 Key Questions that must be asked to begin down the road that allows you to <strong>  Balance Boldly </strong> in life and in business.</p><h3> <strong>  1  st  STEP: </strong> Know what you want and want it without apology</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Your 2 Key Questions: </strong></p><li> How often have spent tons of energy trying to discover what you really want?</li><li> Aren&rsquo;t you tired of digging through mental crates filled with the expectations of other people?</li><p> <br/> Once you feel like you know it- you have to JUMP the hurdle- that default need to explain and apologize for your discovery and the transition that will go with it&hellip; Remind yourself that everything you do that&rsquo;s outside of the box of someone else&rsquo;s expectation or understanding doesn&rsquo;t require an apology, at least not from you.</p><h3> <strong>  2  nd  STEP: </strong>  Invest in <strong>  Double SS </strong> Noise Cancellation B.u.d.s.s ( Better Understand Distractions Sabotage Success ) <br/>  </h3><li> <p>  Emails, text messages, social or professional &ldquo;long calls&rdquo; and the infamous  <strong>   Wall Flower Coffee Conversations  </strong>  ! &ndash; You know, when people hold you hostage at the event because they&rsquo;re afraid once you leave they&rsquo;ll be no one interesting to cage afterwards. All of those distractions can and will sabotage your success if you don&rsquo;t in fact understand just how powerful they are and recognize the trap that reclaims you day after day. </p></li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  Second things Second. </strong> Now that you feel a bit bolder, you need to Hustle Smarter.</h3><p> <br/> There are a ton of things we could go over to point out how and why all your brilliance is blocking your ability to hustle a bit smarter. But since your attention span isn&rsquo;t built for that in the middle of running at high performance speed inside your life or business, we&rsquo;ll skip right over to the best part. You have made the common mistake of connecting with posers who pretend they want to partner with you on your journey. We&rsquo;ve all been there, done that and bought a t-shirt and a cap with the mistake written across in huge red letters. Now it&rsquo;s time to decipher with a quick reminder of who you are and where they will stand in your life, if at all.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how to bring in Non -Posturing Partners in the fold and be clear with them on the position!</p><li> Choose who should become <strong>  strategic partners </strong> for projects, joint ventures AND double as referral sources- you will recognize them by their genuine givers gain attitude!</li><li> Choose who will be key <strong>  subject matter expert </strong> <strong>  resources </strong> for your network- you&rsquo;ll recognize these dapper Dan and Diane&rsquo;s from their passion and correlating acumen.</li><li> Only a select few will take on an inner-circle role and have a seat on your <strong>  BRAIN TRUST </strong> and this my friend must be earned over time. No one should girl-friend or bro-mance their way into this area of our life or business. This is a STRICTLY GROWTH deposits only area. The few who survive those time tested moments, like those 3am calls filled with anxiety, clarity seeking or reassurance and meet with you with consistent, gentle, raw, honesty that you eagerly reciprocate are you go-to&rsquo;s in this area.</li><p> <br/> Keep in mind that the first two positions will often overlap in the initial stages of your relationship, but there will be clear distinguishable markers that remind you of their key position!</p><p> Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t hold one of these 3 key positions in your life or business, yet insist they have your best interest and want to partner with you is simply posing. They want to get close enough to zap your energy, ideas or resources and trust me when I tell you they have no intention of refueling your tank when they&rsquo;re done.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-21 14:29:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-21 14:29:06.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/balance-boldly-and-hustle-smarter.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/balance-boldly-and-hustle-smarter/\", \"post_id\": \"12644\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-21 14:29:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-21 14:29:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"balance-boldly-and-hustle-smarter\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12643\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6143\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/balance-boldly-and-hustle-smarter.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"789\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469203200,"author_id":357,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5895,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Get Results to Be Successful in a New Work Environment","link":"how-to-get-results-to-be-successful-in-a-new-work-environment","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;It used to be presumed that if you weren&rsquo;t at your desk working, you weren&rsquo;t working, but we said &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t we make a workplace where casual meetings are as important as working at your desk?&rsquo; Sometimes that&rsquo;s where your better creative work happens.&rdquo; &mdash; David Chipperfield <br/>  </h3><p> The days of command and control leadership are gone. So are the days of slaving away in a factory for your entire life until retirement. The Millennial generation finds the old way of doing business stifling. Employees are becoming more agile and connected than ever; they want flexibility and autonomy. So, how do you get the results you need to be successful in this new work environment?</p><h3> Be observant <br/>  </h3><p> As a leader, you must keep a finger on the pulse of your work environment. The best way to do this is actual, first person observation. Not observation from some corner office, but out on the floor, in the middle of operations observation. When you are out on the floor you get to know your employees, their wants, and their needs. When you really know what&rsquo;s going on, you can make the needed adjustments to keep things running smoothly.</p><h3> Share information <br/>  </h3><p> Gone are the days of employees being satisfied with only being provided the information that management deems pertinent to their particular tasks. This generation has grown up being bombarded with information; they want access to all to the data and then to be allowed to sort through it on their own. Start sharing the &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; information. Where is the company going? How is it going to get there? What is the market like? What kind of changes can they expect to see? The more informed your employees are the better contribution they can make.</p><h3> Ask questions <br/>  </h3><p> There is no better way to learn what is working, what is not, what people want, what people need, and what people know than by asking. You may actually be surprised at the new knowledge you may gain and the new opportunities that might be brought to your attention if only you were to ask the right questions. I&rsquo;m not talking about closed door meetings with trusted advisors. Again, I&rsquo;m talking about out on the floor, employees at every level questioning.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Follow up <br/>  </h3><p> If you ask the question and you get an answer, you better make sure you follow up. Lack of follow up sends the message that you have no respect for the needs, wants, or input of your employees. More than ever, it&rsquo;s important that your employees know they are being heard. When you not only ask the questions, but truly listen to the answers and then follow up, employees will learn to trust you. And, they only really follow those they trust.</p><h3> Be flexible <br/>  </h3><p> A rigid work environment is no longer appealing. Why do you care? Because unless you provide an appealing work environment you will lose your best talent and be unable to attract the caliber of talent needed to compete with organizations where flexibility is embraced. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to allow employees to run helter-skelter; it just means that you allow them to make adjustments so that their work and personal lives can become more integrated.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s a New Environment <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s a new work environment. What worked in the past will not attract and keep good employees in the future. The way you lead is going to have to change. Become observant. Start sharing information. Ask questions. Make sure you follow up. And, learn to be flexible.</p><p> This new workforce has a lot to offer. Make sure that you provide the right environment so they are offering it to you and not your competition.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-21 14:35:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-21 14:35:04.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_8e4WaC9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-results-to-be-successful-in-a-new-work-environment/\", \"post_id\": \"12646\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-21 14:35:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-21 14:35:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-results-to-be-successful-in-a-new-work-environment\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12645\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6144\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-get-results-be-successful-new-work-environment.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"715\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469199600,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

Tomorrow, you&rsquo;re going to be interviewed on a show that everyone in your niche market watches. You&rsquo;ll get a chance to talk about yourself and your practice.</p><p> You think to yourself, &ldquo;My phone is going to be ringing off the hook with new clients!&rdquo;</p><p> As the interview begins, you&rsquo;re given a flattering introduction. It&rsquo;s as if you wrote the words yourself.</p><p> And now, cameras rolling, the reporter asks her first question, &ldquo;Mr. Advisor, I&rsquo;m impressed by your credentials. But sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult to understand the differing roles of financial advisors. Please take 20 or 30 seconds and tell the audience what you do.&rdquo;</p><p> In the split second following the question, you think to yourself, &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s an easy question. I can really impress this audience filled with my potential clients.&rdquo;</p><p> Unfortunately, the next thing you remember is your face turning blood red. You hope the makeup they made you wear for the interview will hide your embarrassment.</p><p> You blew it&hellip;</p><p> The self-introduction (commonly referred to as an elevator statement or a Unique Selling Proposition) you told yourself you&rsquo;d &ldquo;get to someday&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t on the tip of your tongue.

Often it's due to not having a clear Unique Selling Proposition (USP) that they can reel off with ease.</p><p> Many advisors continually place this &ldquo;chore&rdquo; at the bottom of their &ldquo;to do&rdquo; lists, only to be reminded of its importance when they invariably miss an opportunity to put it to good use.</p><p> Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, blowing a self-introduction is rarely fatal. It may ruin a first-impression, but with time and the right audience it can be overcome. But, why waste the time or take a chance?</p><p> So, you might be thinking, how does this specifically apply to me as a financial advisor?</p><p> It&rsquo;s simple.</p><p> When someone asks you to describe your vision or, more commonly, what you do, they might be a potential client of your practice or someone who could make referrals.

I was about to wrap up for the day. The phone rang. I was tempted to let the caller leave a message. But I was curious, so I picked up the receiver.</p><p> The voice was animated. &ldquo;Hello, I&rsquo;m Sal Esposito. You don&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo; A pause. Then, &ldquo;Wow, I can&rsquo;t believe I actually got you on the phone! I&rsquo;m such a fan of your books. Actually, all of us are here at Stevens Brown.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted you&rsquo;ve enjoyed them. How can I be of help to you?&rdquo;</p><p> Sal&rsquo;s enthusiasm was over the top. He sounded like a kid who just walked into his living room on Christmas morning and sees the tree with all the presents stacked under it.</p><p> Sal explained his situation and continued, &ldquo;The approach you take in your books really resonates with us here. It&rsquo;s just what we need. We&rsquo;re ready to pull the trigger on this. Everyone&rsquo;s lined up behind it. What&rsquo;s your availability like? How soon could you start on a program with us? And how much would you charge? I know it&rsquo;s hard to say without getting more details, but maybe you could just give me an idea of your fees?&rdquo;</p><p> Most initial calls are exploratory. Usually, a potential client is just thinking about doing something. They feel dissatisfaction with their current progress, and want to explore getting help. Not Sal&mdash;he was so excited he couldn&rsquo;t contain himself. He compressed what might normally be hours of conversations with a potential client into 20 minutes. We agreed that I would send him a short outline with some ideas, and then we&rsquo;d talk again in a few days.</p><p> Before I did anything I went down my checklist. Is this an urgent issue for the client? Yes. Does Sal &ldquo;own&rdquo; the problem&mdash;is he the right executive to be dealing with? He seems to be. Are they dissatisfied with the current rate of progress? Absolutely! Do they trust me as the preferred provider to help them? Well, they loved my books&mdash;it seems like they do.</p><p> Yet, something nagged at me. I just couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on it.</p><p> Over the next week, Sal called me two more times and I sent him a proposal, with several options. The nagging feeling persisted, but I brushed it off.</p><p> We were due to talk the following week, but Sal cancelled the call. Then, nothing. He stopped answering my calls and emails. No signed proposal came back. No kickoff meeting was scheduled. No conference call with his colleagues took place. The intensity of the deadening silence matched Sal&rsquo;s initial, unbridled enthusiasm. I&rsquo;d been proposed to for marriage, and we&rsquo;d sent the invitations out to the guests. But now the bride had disappeared.</p><p> Three weeks later I got an email from Sal. It was short: &ldquo;Look, I think we have to put this on the back burner for now. Some other priorities have emerged that we have to deal with. I&rsquo;ll be back in touch. We really do feel there&rsquo;s a great fit here. We just love your work.&rdquo;</p><p> That was five years ago, and I never heard back from Sal. Not once.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> During my career I&rsquo;ve had quite a handful of encounters with others like Sal. The storyline is the same each time: The prospective client calls you and just can&rsquo;t wait to get started. And then, after you spend a week or more running around meeting their demands, the opportunity mysteriously dies. You are offered no more than a vague, curt explanation, if that.</p><p> Although I never did business with Sal&rsquo;s company, I can thank him for this principle: Serious engagement needs a relationship.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve learned there are no shortcuts when it comes to getting real and lasting results. You need the foundation of a trusting relationship. In this case, I was taken in by the prospective client&rsquo;s enthusiasm and excitement.</p><p> Had I slowed things down, and built more of a relationship, there still might not have been a sale. But the odds of getting one would have been higher. I would have discovered what was really going on in Sal&rsquo;s organization. I might also have uncovered some red flags and not wasted my time.</p><p> I mistook enthusiasm for my books for a trusting relationship. But enthusiasm alone&mdash;for your products, your company&rsquo;s brand, or your personality&mdash;is not enough by itself to conclude a contract.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-21 14:38:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-21 14:38:50.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_OjUc7d5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-the-most-promising-leads-often-fall-flat/\", \"post_id\": \"12650\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-21 14:38:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-21 14:38:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-the-most-promising-leads-often-fall-flat\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12649\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6146\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-most-promising-leads-often-fall-flat.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"409\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469181600,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5898,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Closing the Gender Gap in Financial Careers Requires Creativity","link":"closing-the-gender-gap-in-financial-careers-requires-creativity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Only 31% of U.S. financial advisors are women, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And only 23% of certified financial planners are women, according to the CFP Board.</p><p> What&rsquo;s behind this gender imbalance in professions geared toward giving people financial advice? A study conducted on behalf of the CFP Board Women&rsquo;s Initiative Advisory Panel aimed to find out.</p><p> In analyzing women and financial careers, the authors of the study used the analogy of the childhood game &ldquo;Chutes and Ladders.&rdquo;</p><p> Women have many potential ladders to success, but there are just as many, if not more, &ldquo;chutes&rdquo; where they can slip back down. Potential chutes are:</p><li> Lack of information: Women generally don&rsquo;t have adequate information about what financial planning involves or what it takes to have a successful career in the industry.</li><li> Business models: The way financial planning businesses are structured and the compensation methods tend to not appeal to women.</li><li> Gender bias and discrimination: Women are less likely to pursue financial planning as a career, believing firms are less likely to hire and support them.</li><li> Work-life balance: Women are less likely to consider a career in financial planning because of concerns about balancing work and family life.</li><li> Support systems: Women are deterred by a lack of visible role models, networks and professional development programs in financial planning. <br/>  </li><p> I had the privilege of attending the 2016 Global Forum on Girls&rsquo; Education, where I learned and spoke about opportunities for young women to pursue a career in financial planning. As a certified financial planner, I recognize the important role I can play in pointing women toward this career path.</p><p> Other financial professionals, educators and parents can do the same. We must inspire creativity and reflection, and one of the best ways to do that is through activities that will help young women see the possibilities.</p><p> The CFP Board, which sets standards for the profession, has built a nationwide network of Women&rsquo;s Initiative advocates who work to educate their communities about financial planning and how it can be a rewarding career for women. These CFP professionals visit schools and colleges, women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; groups, and professional associations to share their stories and discuss opportunities in financial planning.</p><p> Here are some activities teachers and parents can share with young women and girls in the classroom or at home to put them on a path toward a career in financial planning:</p><h3> Remember the past, but prepare for the future <br/>  </h3><p> Women&rsquo;s History Month this past March marked how far women have come. Decades ago it was unheard of for a woman to assume financial responsibility for her family. Women were not allowed to vote. While there have been big strides in the women&rsquo;s movement, we still have a long way to go.</p><p> I ask young women interested in becoming financial advisors to pretend they can predict the future and to create a timeline of a few important future dates in women&rsquo;s history. What do they want to see happen 10 or 20 years from now? What do they need to do to help realize that change?</p><p> By working backward, young women can visualize how small steps they take now can lead to bigger ones later and contribute to larger social changes.</p><h3> Play &lsquo;Did you know?&rsquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Many young women don&rsquo;t know about other women&rsquo;s achievements and their impact on society. Have a group of young women research interesting facts about women and finances and share their knowledge.</p><p> For example, UN Women notes: &ldquo;When more women work, economies grow. An increase in female labor force participation &mdash; or a reduction in the gap between women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s labor force participation &mdash; results in faster economic growth.&rdquo;</p><p> Another way to inspire young minds is to have young women research women who have successful financial careers. Role models are important for girls&rsquo; self-esteem and confidence, and learning the inspiring stories about women who came before them can help. Young women can research national or international figures, or they can talk to people in their inner circles, such as their own mothers and teachers.</p><h3> Get interactive <br/>  </h3><p> For hands-on learners, an interactive activity can be a fun way to learn about money. One potential exercise: Have participants pick an item they want to buy. On a sheet of paper, let them brainstorm ways they can make money to purchase the item. Encourage each young woman to solicit more ideas from the group. Some ideas may include tutoring, babysitting or selling crafts or homemade goods. At the end of the session, ask each participant how it felt to help someone with a money question.</p><p> Stress the importance of saving some of what they&rsquo;ve earned and educate them on the importance of financial planning. Then, take the opportunity to tell them about financial planning as a career choice.</p><p> Young women need to believe they can do anything. Creating activities helps them realize anything is possible with support, hard work and education.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-21 14:41:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-21 14:41:18.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_IGiKh2c.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/closing-the-gender-gap-in-financial-careers-requires-creativity/\", \"post_id\": \"12652\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-21 14:41:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-21 14:41:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"closing-the-gender-gap-in-financial-careers-requires-creativity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12651\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6147\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/closing-gender-gap-financial-careers-requires-creativity.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"731\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469174400,"author_id":320,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5899,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Another Competitive Advantage: Uniqueness","link":"another-competitive-advantage-uniqueness","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Business Strategy</h3><p> <br/> Not all hotdogs are the same.</p><p> I love a good hotdog. Since I was a little boy, I can remember my parents taking me to the ball game and having a delicious hot dog.</p><p> I also remember some family barbecues where we had those fancy big thick kosher hot dogs. It took a while, but I eventually developed a taste for the fancier hot dogs.</p><p> Well recently I took a liking to a Chicago style hot dog. These dogs are different. It&rsquo;s not a true Chicago hot dog unless it includes very specific ingredients. You start with a Vienna all-beef hot dog that is boiled, not grilled and placed into a soft poppy seed hot dog bun. Then you add the ingredients, in this specific order. Yellow mustard, sweet green pickle relish, onion, tomato wedges, pickle spear, sport peppers and celery salt. The pickle spear is laid on top of all of this. And, forget about ketchup! That is considered Chicago style hot dog blasphemy.</p><p> So, why am I sharing all of this information about Chicago style hot dogs? Because this dog is a metaphor for a competitive  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-confidence/set-it-and-forget-it-a-powerful-customer-service-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  business success strategy </a> , which is uniqueness.</p><p> You can buy a hot dog in many places around the world, but not all of them serve up the Chicago style hot dog. The street vendor in New York isn&rsquo;t serving a Chicago style dog. Sure, there are places in cities outside of Chicago that will serve the authentic Chicago style dog. And, if that particular dog is what you really want, and you don&rsquo;t live in Chicago where this style of hot dog is the norm, you may drive a little further and spend a little more money to get it. That&rsquo;s what uniqueness does.</p><p> So if a hot dog is a metaphor for business, what makes your dog different? This is your competitive differentiator. For example, there are lots of car dealers that sell the same make and model of the car you own. What one thing, perhaps unique compared to the other dealerships, did your dealership do to make you buy the car from them? It can be price, location, customer service, speed and any other feature or benefit that separates them from the other dealerships.</p><p> The big uniqueness question is, &ldquo;Why should a customer buy from you over your competition?&rdquo; It is tied to what you do that is different. Give me one reason &ndash; or several. Is it quality, speed, price, customer service or any other feature that makes you unique in your market place? The answer is what gives you a competitive advantage worth exploiting.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-21 14:43:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-21 14:43:13.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/another-competitive-advantage-uniqueness.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/another-competitive-advantage-uniqueness/\", \"post_id\": \"12654\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-21 14:43:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-21 14:43:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"another-competitive-advantage-uniqueness\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12653\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6148\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/another-competitive-advantage-uniqueness.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"664\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469185200,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}

And everyone seems to be grappling for answers.</p><p> I have to begin by saying this first: just like everyone else, I don&rsquo;t have any easy answers. It&rsquo;s such a complex question, and the &ldquo;right&rdquo; solution is going to be different for everyone based on everything from your age and general health to your social and environmental preferences. But one thing is for certain: with the tsunami of Baby Boomers hitting their later retirement years, this issue is only going to escalate. As I look at the options that are out there today, I wonder if finding new, better solutions is going to be up to us seniors rather than the companies who have been busily trying (and in many ways failing) to deliver on what we need to live the most fulfilling lives possible in our last stage of life.</p><p> At the moment, the most common options for seniors include:</p><li> Aging in place. This has been a popular discussion for years now, both among seniors and in the press. It&rsquo;s attractive to many because most of us have spent a good part of our lives making our houses our homes. Whether we&rsquo;ve been in the same place for decades or just a few years, we&rsquo;ve nested here. It&rsquo;s where the things we love exist, and it&rsquo;s where the people or the memories of the people we care about the most reside. It&rsquo;s comfortable. But it&rsquo;s not optimal for everyone. The cost of in-home care is not covered by Medicare, and the costs of care can be exorbitant. Plus, it can be lonely, especially of your home isn&rsquo;t in an urban environment where company is just past your doorstep.</li><li> Independent living communities. These communities are usually built by corporations for a profit, so they can be costly, but they can be the perfect fit for some. Many of my closest friends call Laguna Woods home, and they&rsquo;re constantly telling me how wonderful it is and how strong the community is there. Another friend is looking at Rancho Mission Viejo, a new 55+ development just east of Laguna Niguel. It&rsquo;s luxurious, but those luxuries come with a hefty price tag. The pros of these communities include local facilities, a close-knit group of other seniors, and lots (and lots!) of activities. The cons: every neighbor is a senior as well, so there&rsquo;s no diversity and no &ldquo;younger&rdquo; energy. Plus, by necessity, these larger communities are often a city unto themselves, so getting beyond the gate requires driving, which is not always an option in later years.</li><li> Assisted living communities. Also called Continuing Care Retirement Communities, these facilities are designed for seniors who require a variety of levels of care and provide everything from independent living options to full-time nursing care and, in some cases, even hospice facilities. This type of community can be particularly attractive to couples who want to age together in a facility that offers various levels of care in a single location. Though they&rsquo;re often expensive, a couple can move there together as early as age 55, sometimes even into a single family home, and then shift their joint or individual level of care as they age. Interestingly, as a board member at Heritage Pointe, a senior living center in Mission Viejo, I&rsquo;ve seen an unexpected evolution to the structure. As the independent residents have aged, the facility has become more of an assisted living facility than a hub of senior activity. As a result, it&rsquo;s not attracting younger retirees, so the mission of the facility has evolved as well. Until we identify a solution to the challenge (which we will!), this facility&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sure others like it&mdash;are in a bit of a quandary.</li><li> Co-housing. Personally, this concept intrigues me. The concept is that seniors who have the same preferences work together to purchase and design their own housing situation&mdash;where they want it, and how they want it. I&rsquo;d love to live in Dana Point after I retire, but it&rsquo;s doubtful I could afford an &ldquo;aging-in-place&rdquo; option there, and there are no independent or assisted living communities in the area. By banding together with like-minded seniors, it may be possible to purchase an ideal property and either lease commercial property on the site to provide essential services, or ensure the property is located near the services we would need. It may sound like a new twist on the old commune, but I think it could really work this time around!</li><li> Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs): This is my other favorite. A twist on &ldquo;aging in place,&rdquo; NORCs are community-based programs formed in neighborhoods where the residents are already living and aging. Rather than having to leave their own homes, services and facilities evolve out of the community, and are built or formed to serve its aging residents. On the plus side, seniors are able to stay in their existing neighborhoods and maintain close relationships that can dramatically improve quality of life as they age. And with built-to-serve facilities, they can receive a certain level of care. On the downside, while some NORCs establish assisted-care and other medical-level facilities within the community, high-need care is not part of the standard structure.</li><p> If you&rsquo;re overwhelmed with this major decision, know this: you are not alone!</p><p> There&rsquo;s so much confusion and emotion about this major life choice, and it&rsquo;s no wonder. Everyone understands that buying a first home is a huge decision&mdash;one that&rsquo;s rife with excitement and new beginnings because it&rsquo;s understood that what you choose will contribute to your quality of life in this first stage of adult life. Choosing where to spend the last phase of your life is perhaps an even bigger decision. Plus, the options are limited.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The only advice I can offer is to make that decision while it&rsquo;s still your decision. Don&rsquo;t wait until you&rsquo;re &ldquo;ready&rdquo;&mdash;that time may never come or, when it does, the decision may no longer be your own. No matter how overwhelming it may be, consider the options (or even better, create your own!) and make the right choice for you.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-21 14:44:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-21 14:44:53.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_AWlajBn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/word-of-advice-on-where-and-how-to-live-after-retirement/\", \"post_id\": \"12656\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-21 14:44:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-21 14:44:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"word-of-advice-on-where-and-how-to-live-after-retirement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12655\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6149\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/word-advice-where-and-how-live-after-retirement.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"759\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469196000,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}

Hmm&hellip;let&rsquo;s think about a recent product launch that fits that description.</p><p> How about learning from the makers of Pok&eacute;mon Go?</p><p> Days before its release, millions of posts began to appear on social feeds (despite minimal marketing) and within one day of the US launch Pok&eacute;mon Go became the top-grossing app on iOS (not bad for a free to download app relying on in-app purchases).</p><p> So what can all of us learn about &ldquo;craveabilty&rdquo; based on Pok&eacute;mon Go?</p><p> Here are a few things to consider&hellip;</p><p> 1) Join a Parade, Don&rsquo;t Start One &ndash; Pok&eacute;mon has always had a strong following but an April 1, 2014 joke by Google blending Google maps with Pok&eacute;mon had more than 18 million views. That prompted the team at Niantic Labs (led by a former Google executive) to take on the Pok&eacute;mon Go project.</p><p> 2) Pique Interest and Build Anticipation for Your Core Fans &ndash; Rather than hyping the app&rsquo;s release endlessly and in a shotgun manner (commercials, social media saturation, etc). Pok&eacute;mon Co. produced an announcement trailer about 8 months prior to release which prompted brand fans to wait and wonder. According to Ad Age, &ldquo;In social media, Niantic tweeted that the game was available in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. After that, it retweeted a couple mentions of the game from other accounts, but not much else&hellip;unlike games such as Mobile Strike, Pok&eacute;mon Go hasn&rsquo;t had a single TV commercial.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> 3) Leverage technology and interactivity &ndash; While much has been promised from augmented-reality technology, Niantic delivered an emotionally engaging experience. More importantly, they have people catching Pikachu and Squirtle (along with other characters) in a very social way. They are activating people to move and experience other gamers as well as the physical world around them.</p><p> Ok, I&rsquo;m not saying that these lessons gleaned from Pok&eacute;mon Go will guarantee identical breakthrough success&hellip;but I&rsquo;m certain they will augment the reality of having your customers actively talk about your products and services.

{"original_id":5902,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Customer Service: The Value of Rewarding 'Above and Beyond' Behavior","link":"customer-service-the-value-of-rewarding-above-and-beyond-behavior","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> You have a very negative experience with a customer service representative (CSR) in a situation of importance to you. How do you respond? <br/>  </h3><p> You have a very positive experience with a CSR in a situation of importance to you. How do you respond?</p><p> Perhaps it&rsquo;s simply human nature. Regardless, many studies show a negative customer service experience is likely to be shared far more widely &ndash; and with more passion &ndash; than a positive experience. This reality serves as a potent warning for all customer-facing businesses.</p><h3> When Expectations are Way Off <br/>  </h3><p> Often, if we&rsquo;ve had a negative prior experience, we head into the next similar situation with low expectations for a positive experience.</p><p> What if &ndash; much to your surprise &ndash; rather than a negative experience, the experience is overwhelmingly positive? What if the CSR&rsquo;s response exceeds your highest expectations? How do you respond?</p><p> I recently had occasion to witness a situation where a CSR relatively new to her position clearly went out of her way to help the customer with a specific issue. Due to complexity of the issue, multiple phone calls were required (both ways). The CSR also sent multiple emails to provide additional information and (via email) introduced the customer to someone with information and expertise beyond the CSR. She did this after calling the expert to provide them with the relevant background information and obtain their permission for the introduction.</p><p> Wow! The customer was very pleased to conclude the call with the potential for the situation to actually be resolved, and thrilled that someone with expertise on the subject had already agreed to take a call to discuss options.</p><h3> Taking the Opportunity <br/>  </h3><p> The caller could have simply been incredibly pleased.</p><p> Since the call was addressing a very specific issue, and not made to a company friends and family were ever likely to contact, there wasn&rsquo;t much opportunity to share the experience with others.</p><p> However, there were (at least) two worthwhile opportunities:</p><li> Send an email to the CSR stressing how the way she handled the call and the issue were extremely appreciated, and considerably beyond expectations.</li><li> Send an email to the director the CSR reports to. Specifically outline the situation and how well the CSR handled the situation well, mentioning actions that would be perceived positively by the direction, and also how the CSR had represented the company well.</li><p> Email Responses</p><p> Clearly the CSR hadn&rsquo;t received similar emails &ndash; at least not frequently. Her response: <br/> Wow, I am speechless right now. You have just paid me the HIGHEST compliment I could possibly receive! Thank you so much for this email, it truly means more to me than you could ever know. It has been a true pleasure and great learning experience for me to be able to assist you and hopefully find you a solution.</p><p> The Director apparently also rarely receives such emails. Her response: <br/> What a breath of fresh air into my day. I am glad XXXXX has been good to work with, and I appreciate you taking the time to share the feedback. I will be sure to share it with her. I share your feelings regarding her attitude and work ethic, she is a pleasure to have on my team.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Looking Forward <br/>  </h3><p> While actual resolution to the issue was a multi-week, onerous task, the time it took to write these two emails was about 20 minutes.</p><p> Similar efforts with employees throughout your company would likely also be extremely well received. Perhaps it&rsquo;s worth making a habit of &ldquo;catching people doing great work&rdquo; in your organization &ndash; and encouraging the habit among your leadership team.</p><p> Something to consider.</p><h3> Recalibrating Actions: <br/>  </h3><li> Evaluate how &lsquo;stellar employees&rsquo; are rewarded &ndash; throughout the year &ndash; not just in annual performance reviews.</li><li> If not currently in place, establish a practice for managers at all levels to &lsquo;catch people doing great work.&rdquo; Share examples among the management/leadership team, and retain the information.</li><li> Recognize those employees with the most compelling positive work on a company-wide level periodically.</li><li> Consider putting a &lsquo;catch someone doing a great job&rsquo; into practice personally.</li><h3> Recalibrate Strategies <br/>  </h3><p> Recalibrate Strategies help companies grow their business.

Why do people still think it&rsquo;s okay to hard sell through social networks? <br/>  </h3><p> Social media is about building relationships, growing the trust of an audience, giving them a reason to believe in a brand, developing an understanding of who they are, deciphering what kind of value they will appreciate and learning how to best serve them.</p><p> It is NOT about subjecting a new fan or follower to a multitude of reasons why they should buy a product or service without even taking the time to know who they are.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s back up and think about this from a different perspective. Envision yourself going to buy a car. As soon as you pull up, you&rsquo;re filled with anxiety. You are part excited about buying a new vehicle and part nervous about getting a good deal on that vehicle. How will you know what price is fair? Or if you can trust the salesman? It&rsquo;s the same with social media.</p><p> There should be no difference between how people are treated online or in face-to-face interactions. Would you jump on a customer as soon as they walk in the door with a hard sell? Would you appreciate it if someone did that to you? Maybe that&rsquo;s your approach, but it&rsquo;s not the right approach if you truly care about giving the customer a valuable experience. And I think that&rsquo;s where some folks get lost &ndash; they forget about the customer, and how they would want to be treated.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> It&rsquo;s common courtesy to have respect for fans or followers as we would a real live person who is standing in front of us.

The person on the other end may not be interested, but could be useful down the road.</p><p> It&rsquo;s obvious when someone wants to sell me something or is interested in having me help them in some way. And as a salesperson, I enjoy sitting back and watching the pitch. But I do not entertain someone who throws it in my face without getting to know me, what I do or how they can be of service to me. Quite frankly, I think it&rsquo;s rude and assuming.

{"original_id":5904,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Deep Look at the Influences That Shape Millennials in the Workplace","link":"a-deep-look-at-the-influences-that-shape-millennials-in-the-workplace","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Bersin by Deloitte recently compiled a thought-provoking infographic of statistics entitled &ldquo;Meet the modern learner&rdquo;. <br/>  </h3><p> But who are the &lsquo;modern learners&rsquo; and what are the influences that make their educational needs in the workplace so different? Millennials, the much talked about new generation of workers, are disrupting traditional L&amp;D strategies. With this generation now making up 50% of the US workforce, and set to dominate the global workforce by 2020, it&rsquo;s time to rethink how we reach out to them. Let's cut through the stereotypes and take a deeper look at the influences that shape this generation:</p><h3> The Tech Generation <br/>  </h3><p> Unlike older generations, traditional training programs will not have as great an impact on tech-oriented millennials. According to a study by PWC, three-quarters of millennials believe access to technology makes them more effective at work. This generation wants their information to be easily accessible, quick and mobile. In fact, 67% judge their employers based on their technological knowledge and 59% said that an employer&rsquo;s provision of state-of-the art technology was important to them when considering a job.</p><h3> The Goldfish Generation <br/>  </h3><p> This raises questions as to the best way to reach the tech generation. Growing up in the Twitter age, millennials are attuned to consuming short snippets of information and a constant flow of instant feedback. A recent study by Microsoft went viral when it claimed that our average attention spans are now lower than a goldfish: the culprit being modern technology, and particularly smartphones.</p><p> Since then voices have come out to argue that this is not a sign that the tech generation has gotten dumber, it simply means that they process information faster. What is certain is that having to wait for an annual performance review does not fit well with this generation&rsquo;s high learning demands.</p><h3> The Social Networkers <br/>  </h3><p> PWC found that 41% of millennials prefer to communicate electronically at the office rather than face to face or over the phone. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re an anti-social threat to the office. In fact, as you watch them typing away on their smartphones they are probably collaborating with several different team members at the same time.</p><p> Being raised on Facebook and now Instagram and Snapchat, this generation is used to sharing constant updates about what they&rsquo;re doing and similarly gathering information from others. When given tools to collaborate, millennials are much more likely to ask for and share development information with their peers.</p><h3> The MyPod Generation <br/>  </h3><p> Often referred to as the MyPod Generation, they are used to a high level of customization and expect no less when it comes to learning. With the rise of YouTube, blogging and online courses, this generation is used to going online to learn everything from cooking to programming on their own. The increase in flexible and remote working schedules, means that employees don&rsquo;t want to be limited to fixed time slots when they can receive development training.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Rather than simply providing set training courses, they want to be able to choose between different mediums of learning and decide when they want to learn. Ultimately, a survey of millennials conducted by PWC found that working with great coaches and getting on the job training were the top two most important training opportunities employers should provide. Make it easier for your millennials to take ownership of the learning process by providing tools that give them the power to ask for coaching when they want and need it most.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-21 14:54:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-21 14:54:38.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_Vuof0no.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-deep-look-at-the-influences-that-shape-millennials-in-the-workplace/\", \"post_id\": \"12664\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-21 14:54:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-21 14:54:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-deep-look-at-the-influences-that-shape-millennials-in-the-workplace\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12663\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6153\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/deep-look-influences-shape-millennials-workplace.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"516\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469214000,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5906,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Be a Thought Leader in the Digital Era","link":"how-to-be-a-thought-leader-in-the-digital-era","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Quite a bit of jargon exists in the financial services industry, and the term thought leadership now falls squarely into that category as well.</h3><p> <br/> But thought leadership is more than a buzzword &ndash; it is a method of creating a stand-out brand that clients and prospects are drawn to, and one in which other advisors want to take part. The continued growth of the financial advisor community coupled with ease of access to information through digital channels makes becoming a thought leader a critical aspect of your success. As a thought leader, you have more influence than the average advisor which positions you as an expert in your specific area of focus.</p><p> Of course, serving clients is atop the list of priorities on a daily basis, but becoming a thought leader should come in as a close second. In doing so, it is important to understand that thought leadership is not your sales presentation or pitch; it goes far beyond day to day business and client interactions. Thought leaders have established themselves as influential advisors in their communities, and nationally, with strong brand recognition and an even stronger reputation among clients and peers. But tackling the objective of becoming a thought leader is not a simple task; it is necessary to carve out your influential place in the financial services industry by following a strategic plan. Here are the steps you can take to become a thought leader in the digital era.</p><h3> <strong>  Develop a Differentiating Message </strong></h3><p> <br/> The majority of financial advisors offer similar products and services to clients, and with the vast number of advisors available in today&rsquo;s marketplace, it is important to develop a message that differentiates your practice from the next. The process goes beyond stating years of experience, earned designations or prestigious firm affiliations; differentiation is built on a specific focus area, or a specific client demographic. Saying you work with baby boomers does not carry as much weight as saying you work with individuals who work for the federal government who plan to retire in five to seven years. The same specificity should be used in describing the services you offer. Asset managers and financial planners are a dime a dozen, but offering strategic retirement income planning for high net worth individuals makes your brand clearly stand out. Your unique message should reflect who you want to have as a client, and it should radiate throughout your entire brand and marketing strategy.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  Create Engaging Content </strong></h3><p> <br/> Once you have developed your differentiating message, it is integral to infuse that value proposition into content. In today&rsquo;s digital environment, clients and prospects can quickly Google the term &ldquo;investment planning&rdquo; and immediately see tens of thousands of results on the web. Sources may vary, but in most instances, the message and the format is the same. To become a thought leader in your unique space, it is crucial to create content that goes a step beyond what every other advisor is publishing.</p><p> Generic content that is not differentiated, uses heavy industry jargon or is badly written is far removed from what your audience wants or needs. Engaging content, such as long-form blog posts, white papers or case studies are an effective way to set yourself apart from the competition while providing valuable information to your readers. Infographics and videos also hit the mark when it comes to thought leadership and ultimately, engagement, as they offer something different than the competition. Regardless of the form used, quality content offers a simple-to-follow arrangement including paragraph headers, bulleted points or lists, and is free of rambling and complex theories.</p><p> In managing your content development and output, it is important to make sure its relevant to today&rsquo;s marketplace and also stands out from the crowd. For instance, writing or speaking about important topics, such as retirement income needs or global events like Brexit, is an obvious choice; what may not be so obvious is your unique voice on the topic. Your content should stand out because it relays a story only you can tell. Maybe it is that you share a controversial perspective, or a method to analyzing an event or investment that trails off the beaten path. Regardless of the content focus, take care to make it different.</p><h3> <strong>  Distribute Digitally </strong></h3><p> <br/> While creating engaging content is paramount to becoming a thought leader, it does little good if it is not shared in the right way. Clients and prospects are quick to gather information from the Internet, and so your content should be there, too. Start with your own website or blog, as the people who are already familiar with you will find your content easily. Then, expand your most valuable content to other mediums, such as LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook. These social media channels can reach a large group of individuals in mere seconds, and quality content tends to travel far.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Partner with News Media </strong></h3><p> <br/> Having a digital content strategy is key to establishing yourself as a thought leader, but connections with local and national news media still play a roll. Traditional news media outlets have strong reputations within communities and demographics, making a partnership imperative to becoming a thought leading financial advisor. Media outlets also have large distribution channels that can propel your message to the masses in a quick and easy way. Think Forbes, Investment News or your local newspaper.</p><p> To establish a partnership with local media sources, start with a list of local and national journalists who cover your competition and begin to build relationships through networking. Once you have established a rapport with the media, submit articles to be placed, pitch ideas for a story or provide feedback on their existing news stories. Sharing content on these credible sites and print publications boosts your brand and reputation, and helps you reach an audience you may otherwise never engage with.</p><h3> <strong>  Engage with your Followers </strong></h3><p> <br/> As you consistently share content, it is necessary to stage engaged yourself. If there are comments left on one of your posts, make sure to take time and respond. Additionally, taking part in group discussions through social media sites is a smart way to stay in the game. You may join specific groups on Facebook or LinkedIn that bring together your ideal client and make it a point to consistently share your thoughts in the comments, either on your own posts or on others. It is also beneficial to link back to other influencers in the field, whether they be individuals, companies or news sources. As you begin to build rapport with outside sources, ask that they share your work to their audiences, too.</p><p> Each of these actions eventually lead you down the path toward thought leadership, but your message must first resonate with important people in order for you truly achieve that prestigious title. Are you sharing information or perspective that makes people stop and think twice? If so, you&rsquo;re on the right track. Remember that influence is the ultimate goal, with each of these strategic steps guiding your way. Develop a message that is truly unique and focused, and then create content that is directed toward your ideal client. Get your messaging in front of your ideal audience by using a broad range of digital avenues, and always remember to stay engaged yourself.

Once you stop selling, magic will happen. It's really that simple, or is it?</h3><p> <br/> Unfortunately, many people associate selling with a negative experience, where somebody is trying to talk us into something that we don&rsquo;t want or need.</p><p> That is why I have been on a mission to elevate the reputation of Sales and its Practitioners, because SOMEBODY HAS TO DO IT!!</p><p> According to Wikipedia &ldquo;A  <strong>  sale </strong>  is the  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade\" target=\"_blank\">  exchange </a>  of a  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity\" target=\"_blank\">  commodity </a>  or  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money\" target=\"_blank\">  money </a>  as the  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\" target=\"_blank\">  price </a> of a  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_%28economics%29\" target=\"_blank\">  good </a>  or a service.&rdquo; I really like the term exchange because it implies a partnership, a shared ben</p><p> In order for sales people to understand what each of their prospect really needs and or wants, we as sales people need to do a lot of research so we can help our prospects understand how our solution could be of unique value to them.</p><p> Sales people can do that by asking lots of questions in order to identify the need. Asking questions is important in every relationship. How on earth would we know what our friends, spouses, colleagues, or children think unless we ask them?</p><p> Assuming that we know what prospects want is never a good strategy but that&rsquo;s exactly what many sales people do. They sell instead of listen.</p><p> Only people who are viewed as conceited would recommend anything without knowledge. Imagine, you are at a dinner party and you talk to a person that you just met about the best BBQ ribs &ldquo;ever&rdquo; that you just discovered in a cook book. After a long &ldquo;sales&rdquo; pitch about this fantastic recipe, you realize that the person is a Vegetarian. Embarrassing? Yes, I would say, but in a social setting the consequences are usually not devastating, and they often can be corrected with humor.</p><p> In a sales situation the results are not as amusing, because sometimes you only get one chance to leave a good impression and if you miss it, that could be it (at least for a long time).</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> I know people who constantly sell. They are trying to sell me on the fact that their wife is the best cook, or that they have the best car, or that their job is not only rewarding but also fulfilling in spite of the fact that they constantly complain about their boss.</p><p> Selling is never a good approach. When somebody is trying to sell you something, be on alert. If a person truly has a wife who is a fantastic cook, you don&rsquo;t have to point it out to me. I will figure it out myself and then praise her skills, which is a lot more authentic.</p><p> Professional sales settings aren&rsquo;t different. Let your satisfied clients do the talking. Send your prospects testimonials instead of praising your own product/service.</p><p> And don&rsquo;t sell. Magic happens when you stop selling&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-24 11:43:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-24 11:43:51.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_awi8cgk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-biggest-sales-secret-the-magic-happens-when-you-stop-selling/\", \"post_id\": \"12670\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-24 11:43:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-24 11:43:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-biggest-sales-secret-the-magic-happens-when-you-stop-selling\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12669\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6156\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/biggest-sales-secret-magic-happens-when-you-stop-selling.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"585\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469462400,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5908,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"In an Innovation Economy, the Courageous Will Inherit the Earth","link":"in-an-innovation-economy-the-courageous-will-inherit-the-earth","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HaveYouEmerged\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Jonathon Hensley </a> | <a href=\"http://www.emergeinteractive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Emerge Interactive </a></p><p> Whether it was the will to build a rail system that spanned a continent, the inspiration to put a man on the moon, or the ingenuity to create a computer that fits in the palm of your hand, innovation is woven into the fabric of our nation. As a culture, we celebrate it. We revere the champions who succeed&mdash;those who seem to defy the odds and break the mold. Their work, their genius, profoundly reshapes our lives, our businesses, and how we interact with one another.</p><p> However, where once America was a giant of industry&mdash;the world leader in agriculture, then manufacturing, and ultimately technology&mdash;other global players have now taken the lead. In the current capitalistic context, mass production rules the day. Built-in obsolescence is de rigueur. Lasting quality, artful craftsmanship, and transformational innovation are less and less a part of the mainstream U.S. equation. <br/>                      <br/> But a new era is dawning. Familiar systems, treasured ideologies, and 20th century best practices are giving way to something unprecedented: an innovation ecosystem like none we&rsquo;ve ever seen; one primed to reward a new corporate species&mdash;a new breed that will not only shape the future, but the very planet itself. <br/>                      <br/> This game-changing new player is the courageous brand.                </p><h3> <strong>  Asking the right question                     </strong></h3><p> <br/> In his philosophical text  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games\" target=\"_blank\">  Finite and Infinite Games: A Vision of Life as Play and Possibility </a> , the scholar James P. Carse forwards a theory of culture as &ldquo;life actions&rdquo; broken into two categories of game: one that could be called finite, the other infinite. By Carse&rsquo;s measure, America&rsquo;s cultural and economic model since the industrial revolution has been finite&mdash;a closed game played for the sole purpose of winning. But as Carse points out, to win&mdash;to land on top; to walk away victorious and damn the consequences&mdash;is to end the game. <br/>                      <br/> However, a mere sixteen years into the 21st century, this mindset is shifting. We live in an indisputably interconnected world. Within this context, to win as a separate entity&mdash;as a company or an individual acting alone&mdash;is incredibly harmful to the whole. The game ends. Competition trumps cooperation. Individual gain vanquishes collective benefit. The planet itself transforms into a world that no longer sustains us. <br/>                      <br/> In the finite game no one actually wins. (A fact Nature is plainly driving home.) Even so, the finite game still has its players: old-paradigm brands asking &ldquo;How?&rdquo; <br/>                      <br/> How will we make money on this?   How will we survive in a market changing more rapidly than ever before? How will we win and thereby end the game?                      </p><p> Courageous brands, on the other hand, ask &ldquo; Why? &rdquo;  Why will our customers care, engage, invest? What in their lives, in our world, can we transform for the greater good?  <br/>                  <br/> Only a brave few disruptors have begun to ask this question. The right question. The question that will drive innovation for the second half of the digital age. <br/>                      <br/> With this single question,  Why ?, the conversation transforms. Dialogue elevates. Perspective magnifies. Suddenly, what&rsquo;s needed is much deeper than a catchy corporate statement or a viral video that tugs on people&rsquo;s heartstrings without any nod to proof. <br/>                      <br/> When courageous brands ask  Why ?, value moves from money to meaning&mdash;from  How can I persuade you? to How can I contribute; how can I and add value to your life ?&mdash;and a fundamental reset ricochets through culture. <br/>                      <br/> The model shifts from profit to purpose.</p><h3> <strong>  Leading with true purpose                     </strong></h3><p> <br/> Now more than ever, just below the fog of cynicism, is a true and genuine yearning. A desire, a need for vision. Not just a catchy mission statement, but an underlying purpose. One that consumers can believe, because they see it demonstrated in action. <br/>                      <br/> When purpose transforms into action, a brand&rsquo;s purpose becomes its currency. Its tangible proof of good. Brands become courageous when they offer proof every day, with quantifiable actions that demonstrate a measurable commitment to their customers, the community, and our planet. <br/>                      <br/> <a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Unilever  </a> is a perfect example. They&rsquo;ve got one of the largest corporate footprints in the global market.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Polman\" target=\"_blank\">  Future-facing CEO Paul Polman </a>  sees this as a key advantage. Polman, a tireless advocate for global good who has been a member of a raft of coalitions, councils, boards, trusts, and taskforces dedicated to conservation and sustainability, has led Unilever into a bold new era of corporate social responsibility. <br/>                      <br/> In 2013, under Polman&rsquo;s guidance, the company released the  <a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Unilever Sustainable Living Plan </a> . This ambitious 20-page treatise opens with a rousing vision statement that calls out the problems we&rsquo;re facing: rising temperatures, resource scarcity, food security, and the widening gap between rich and poor. The statement continues, &ldquo;At Unilever, we believe that business must be part of the solution. But to be so, business will have to change. Sustainable, equitable growth is the only acceptable business model.&rdquo;</p><p> Unilever then backs up these statements with 19 pages of proof&mdash;descriptions, data, metrics, infographics, stats, and subsections, all delivering very specific evidence that demonstrates exactly how Unilever is making their bold vision a reality.</p><p> But the vision Polman and Unilever are championing does not eschew profit. Far from it. Instead, the company calls out their realization that sustainability, social responsibility, and environmental innovations actually incite consumers to buy.</p><p> Purpose reveals the path. The path illuminates action. And action builds toward cultural currency rooted in consumer trust.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  Earning attention through the noise </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the most precious gifts we can give&mdash;to a person, or even a brand&mdash;is the gift of our attention. Attention is one of the world&rsquo;s most important resources, individually and collectively. And it&rsquo;s a resource that&rsquo;s growing scarcer by the day. <br/>                      <br/> Attention is a signal: a focused beam of thought and feeling that holds the power to influence anything it touches. Widen that beam too broadly, and focus dissipates. </p><p> Culturally, technologically, and emotionally, we&rsquo;re coming up against the limitations of our attention. We can&rsquo;t manufacture more of it; no matter how hard we try, no matter how many new things demand it. We can only choose where our focus goes, and how sharp or diffused it will be. <br/>                      <br/> When courageous brands demonstrate their brand in action, they reinforce their authenticity of purpose. Much like attention, this purity of commitment is also a force. One that can be felt. And one that naturally, sometimes powerfully, grabs our attention.     <br/>                      <br/> <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Starbucks </a>  is a beautiful example of a courageous brand that was able to harness their passion (quality coffee), and find compelling, authentic ways to earn consumer attention.  <br/>                      <br/> For years, the proliferating green-and-white awnings told a visual success story that unfolded rapidly on virtually every corner of every city in the nation. Eventually, however, Starbucks hit saturation point, even as new and old competitors jumped onto the convenient-quality-coffee bandwagon. Culture and the economy changed as well. A long and significant recession, increased environmental consciousness, and the rise of the craft-coffee movement, all contributed to send the company back to the purpose drawing-board. <br/>                          <br/> In this evolve-or-stagnate moment, Starbucks re-envisioned its core passion in a way that re-established its unique value. The company&rsquo;s new mission reflects a vastly expanded purpose: &ldquo;To inspire the human spirit&mdash;one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.&rdquo; The company embraced an ambitious vision with a much larger scope. A scope that now encompasses the bettering of our collective experience. <br/>                      <br/> As Starbucks  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Schultz\" target=\"_blank\">  Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz </a>  explains in his book  Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul : &ldquo;...we believe that the path we are choosing is the right and best thing to do. We refuse to be bystanders, even if we do not know exactly where our actions will lead.&rdquo; <br/>                                          <br/> Courageous brands create a sense of interest, urgency, enthusiasm, excitement, and even responsibility, by finding meaningful ways to hook into our shared humanity&mdash;even if those desires (in this case, a good cup of coffee in a comfortable, convenient location) are simple.</p><h3> <strong>  From responsibility to influence </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the ultimate, altruistic embodiment of &ldquo;go big or go home,&rdquo; courageous brands maintain a broader, more global view of where they fit&mdash;not just in the market, but in the greater scheme of things. These pioneering brands remain focused on the greater good, on the positive effect they can have, and on the tools they can provide that will lead to this effect&mdash;whether those tools are a product, a platform, or a suite of best practices. <br/>                      <br/> Courageous responsibility comes from ownership. In this case, an unflinching understanding of your impact&mdash;on your market, community, ecosystem, and planet. <br/>                      <br/> Ownership at this level may lead a courageous brand to be more involved in sectors outside of their primary focus. A clothing-design company, in accepting full responsibility for its footprint, might join with its manufacturing partners to shoulder the burden of impact, while actively innovating toward a sustainable next step. <br/>                      <br/> Apparel outfitter  <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Patagonia </a> , founded in 1970 by blacksmith  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvon_Chouinard\" target=\"_blank\">  Yvon Chouinard </a> , has maintained its steadfast commitment to quality, functionality, simplicity, and sustainability. Initially, Chouinard had no desire to own or run a clothing company. (He once joked, &ldquo;What do a bunch of blacksmiths know about sewing, anyway?&rdquo;) As he tells it, &ldquo;I had to figure out a way to become a businessman completely on my own terms.&rdquo; Those terms are evident in the company&rsquo;s mission statement, &ldquo;Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re also demonstrated in Patagonia&rsquo;s ongoing innovations at every level of influence, from supply-chain sourcing and manufacturing, to conscious provisioning and apparel recycling. <br/>                      <br/> In May of 2007, the number of questions posed by eco-savvy consumers showed no sign of abating. Chouinard&mdash;driven by purpose&mdash;responded by challenging a nimble internal team to track the entire lifecycle of five of their products. The company pledged to release the results via Patagonia&rsquo;s website. Not only did this give the company a detailed view of its supply chain (from foreign raw materials to domestic fiber manufacturing), but it revealed surprising data that the company used to spur innovation.  <br/>                      <br/> Patagonia knew they needed to adopt even more rigorous cradle-to-cradle best practices, all the while understanding that the release of their data to consumers would put it in the hands of their competitors. But as Jill Dumain, Director of Environmental Strategy for the company, has explained, &ldquo;Our influence is larger than our impact. If we&rsquo;re willing to share that information, it becomes exponential.&rdquo; <br/>                      <br/> When it comes to responsibility, transparency outweighs cost. <br/>                          <br/> Courageous brands are not only able but willing to move from responsibility to influence. By taking full ownership of what they control&mdash;or can collaborate to control&mdash;courageous brands will discover huge opportunities for innovation in the coming decade. This will require new partnerships and alliances, as well as new ways of thinking and behaving within the marketplace. By so doing, courageous brands can help manifest a new paradigm based on cooperation and collaboration, as opposed to finite-game competition.                </p><h3> <strong>  The new rules </strong></h3><p> <br/> In November of 2011, when  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson\" target=\"_blank\">  Richard Branson </a>  was in London at a press launch for his book   Screw Business As Usual , he explained it this way: &ldquo;I truly believe that capitalism was created to help people live better lives. But sadly, over the years, [capitalism] has lost its way&hellip;. The short-term focus on profit has driven most businesses to forget about the important long-term role they have in taking care of people, and the planet.&rdquo; <br/>                      <br/> Brands and products come and go, their usefulness determined by various changing factors. But mission, vision, purpose&mdash;these are the forces of true power.

{"original_id":5909,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Greatest Financial Risk for Depleting Retirement Resources","link":"the-greatest-financial-risk-for-depleting-retirement-resources","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Knowing how long you may live is an important variable to consider in putting together a successful retirement plan. Many online sites can give you a scientific estimate of your life expectancy; one that I recommend is livingto100.com. When I retook the evaluation recently, I was surprised that my life expectancy had increased from 93 to 98. In an instant I related to one of the greatest fears of older Americans: outliving your sources of income.</p><p> The greatest financial risk for depleting retirement resources is an unexpected and lengthy stay in a long-term health care facility, like a nursing home or an assisted living center. Not surprisingly then, \"What do you think about long term care insurance (LTCI)?\" is one of the questions I often hear.</p><p> LTCI is a difficult product to analyze and recommend. It has existed in some form for 40 years, but the industry seems to exist in a continual state of disarray. Low interest rates, low lapse rates, and rising longevity have driven premiums high enough that sales of the insurance have declined 70% from their high in 2002.</p><p> Exacerbating the problem is that most LTCI companies issued policies with \"guaranteed\" premiums. According to a <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/performance-ltc-from-john-hancock-the-first-participating-long-term-care-insurance-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  report by Michael Kitces at kitces.com </a> , just a small variation in actuarial assumptions can have a significant impact on premiums. He says \"it's estimated that as little as a <a href=\"http://www.mcknights.com/news/metlife-exits-long-term-care-insurance-market/article/190732/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  1% change in interest rates correlates to a 15% required change in premiums to keep an LTC insurance policy actuarially sound </a> . Having <a href=\"http://www.aaltci.org/news/long-term-care-insurance-association-news/long-term-care-insurance-rate-increase-risks-greatly-diminished\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a 1% lapse rate instead of a 5% lapse rate can increase future claims for an insurer by as much as 50% </a> .\"</p><p> As a result, Kitces notes, LTCI providers have struggled to be profitable. In some cases, companies were unable to honor their original prices and had to request permission from state insurance departments to increase premiums on existing policies by as much as 85%. Premiums for new policies have gone even higher.</p><p> Simply stated, a guaranteed premium LTC policy needs to be priced high enough to provide a cushion against these variables or the company may be unable to regain profitability with rate increases later.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> One way of addressing this challenge is to eliminate any aspect of a \"guaranteed\" premium and make long-term care insurance premiums more flexible. One flexible premium policy envisions paying dividends similar to a participating life insurance policy issued by a mutual insurance company. Kitces notes, \"To the extent that future claims (or the insurance company&rsquo;s investment returns) turn out to be better than the original (conservative) projections, the 'excess' results will be returned to the policy owner in the form of either an \"Insurance Credit\" or an \"Interest Credit\", to help reduce future premiums.\" One such policy is currently priced 20 to 30% under traditionally priced policies with \"guaranteed\" premiums.</p><p> Naturally, there is no guarantee a flexible premium policy will end up costing less than the traditional polity with a guaranteed premium. Probably the biggest concern is the conflict of interest a shareholder-owned company will face in deliberately refunding any savings in the form of dividends to the policy holders. This conflict does not exist with a mutual insurance company, where the owners of the company are the policy holders.</p><p> Still, the potential benefits look interesting enough that taking a hard look at a flexible premium LTCI policy makes sense. Long-term health care is one of the aspects of aging that most of us don't want to think about but many of us will need. While LTCI is not for everyone, considering it is a worthwhile part of financial planning for retirement.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-24 12:29:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-24 12:29:02.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_gebLQUR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-greatest-financial-risk-for-depleting-retirement-resources/\", \"post_id\": \"12674\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-24 12:29:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-24 12:29:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-greatest-financial-risk-for-depleting-retirement-resources\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12673\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6158\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/greatest-financial-risk-depleting-retirement-resources.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"742\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469448000,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5910,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Neuroscience Teaches Us about Change Management","link":"what-neuroscience-teaches-us-about-change-management","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> For anyone who has tried to implement a new technology or a new process in wealth management, resistance to change is inevitable. According to research from the Center for Creative Leadership,  <a href=\"http://www.ccl.org/leadership/podcast/transcript3.aspx?pageId=1576\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  75% of change initiatives fail </a>  because of resistant company culture.  The question, therefore, is how to reduce the degree of this resistance?</h3><p> <br/> Dr. Rachel Cotter Davis, Ph.D., argues that this happens because organizations are like human brains&mdash;resistant to change and reliant on stability. She presented this theory at the <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/conference/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Laserfiche Empower Conference </a> and offered several useful insights on human behavior and neuroscience that can be applied to change management.</p><p> Here are some takeaways from Dr. Davis&rsquo; presentation that you can apply to change in your own organization.</p><h3> Why the Brain Hates Change</h3><p> <br/> If your boss told you to rearrange your desk items and gave no explanation, how would you react? Though it seems like a miniscule request, most people&rsquo;s immediate reaction would be to resist or question the demand.</p><p> This example demonstrates how our brains are prone to react negatively to change. According to Dr. Davis and other social neuroscience researchers,  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110812085406/http:/www.davidrock.net/files/ManagingWBrainInMind.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the reason lies in human evolution </a> . In short, our human ancestors depended as much on social belonging for survival as they did on food and shelter. Poor social standing on both an individual and group basis can actually lead to a  <a href=\"http://www.who.int/social_determinants/strategy/Marmot-Social%20determinants%20of%20health%20inqualities.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  higher mortality rate </a> .</p><p> When a person&rsquo;s social environment changes, it challenges his sense of stability (or more specifically, his brain&rsquo;s). If the brain decides the change is, in fact, threatening, then it will resist or avoid the change as much as possible &mdash; &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; mode, as it&rsquo;s often called.</p><p> Though the workplace is often perceived as a logical, transaction-based environment, it is still occupied by humans &mdash; and we humans are emotional beings. When leaders drive some kind of change in the organization, they must consider the impact it will have on their people.</p><h3> Change Management&mdash;You&rsquo;re Doing It Wrong</h3><p> <br/> Some leaders working on a change initiative might be tempted to say, &ldquo;I know this change will be for the better &mdash; everyone will just have to get used to it.&rdquo; However, a &ldquo;my way or the highway&rdquo; attitude fosters an office full of anxious or distrustful workers.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not just steamrollers that create negative energy in the workplace. Micromanagers have the same effect by impeding the autonomy of their workers. This type of leadership actually impairs employees&rsquo; analytical, creative and problem solving abilities. Dr. Davis explained this neurological effect with a helpful analogy:</p><p> &ldquo;Your boss micromanaging you is like someone walking behind you in a dark alley, in terms of what it does to your brain.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> These approaches cause leaders to undermine their employees and make initiating change far more difficult. A change management approach based in neuroscience (&ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.neuroleadership.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  NeuroLeadership </a> &rdquo; as it&rsquo;s becoming known) helps engage the hearts and minds of those who need to change. They will not only be  able  to accept the solution; they will be  willing  to accept it.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Applying Neuroscience to Change Management</h3><p> <br/> Dr. Davis identifies four stages of change resistance and offers ways that leaders can address them.</p><p> <strong>  Stage 1: Denial </strong></p><p> Employees deny that there is a need for change and try to prove that the new method or solution won&rsquo;t work. DOL rule will take effect in one year&rsquo;s time, and many firms are still in the denial stage. Leaders should a pproach this stage with what might seem like excessive communication. Dr. Davis says, &ldquo;Create a vision for the future, maximize face-to-face communication and reiterate everything at least 10 times. Don&rsquo;t just send out an email announcement&mdash;have a dialogue.&rdquo; Think of this stage as a marketing campaign&mdash;you have to sell the idea.</p><p> <strong>  Stage 2: Anger </strong></p><p> Employees complain, become bitter and blame others. Leaders should brace the storm by having an empathetic ear. &ldquo;People need the ability to vent,&rdquo; says Dr. Davis. Even if the leader doesn&rsquo;t take every complaint into serious consideration, allowing people to approach and speak openly fosters trust.</p><p> <strong>  Stage 3: Exploring </strong></p><p> Employees try to negotiate favorable outcomes and offer alternatives to the proposed solution. Leaders should facilitate involvement in the project and encourage employees to offer their suggestions in a constructive manner. Leaders will recognize when this stage begins because employees will complain less and focus more on optimizing the solution.</p><p> <strong>  Stage 4: Acceptance </strong></p><p> Employees accept that the change is necessary and engage with the new solution or process. Leaders should reward employees for their dedication and acceptance and also recognize the success of the change initiative through ROI, anecdotal evidence, etc. Leaders should also look ahead to future improvements on the change that has been implemented.</p><p> Resisting change is not unique to advisors. Following these human behavior fundamentals, wealth firms can become better at adopting new procedures and the right technology tools to steer their enterprises through an unpredictable weather of compliance.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-24 12:32:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-24 12:32:08.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/what-neuroscience-teaches-us-about-change-management.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-neuroscience-teaches-us-about-change-management/\", \"post_id\": \"12676\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-24 12:32:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-24 12:32:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-neuroscience-teaches-us-about-change-management\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12675\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6159\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-neuroscience-teaches-us-about-change-management.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1459\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469440800,"author_id":308,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5911,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Six Basic Qualifiers That You Need to Know About Every Lead","link":"the-six-basic-qualifiers-that-you-need-to-know-about-every-lead","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In today&rsquo;s ongoing series of the &ldquo;Top Ten Characteristics of Top Sales Producers,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going to introduce you to one of the main differences between the Top 20% of sales producers versus the other 80%. </p><h3> And in a sentence it is this: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t close an unqualified lead.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Top Characteristic Part Four: </strong> Thoroughly qualify each and every prospect and client before you set up your close or demo or run your appointment.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll start with a story: I was in the Bay Area giving a training to a group of tech sales reps, and I was talking about what makes up a qualified lead and how important it is.  I went over the six things you need to know about each prospect before you set up a close, and then I covered specific scripted questions (along with rebuttals for any resistance) and how to get this information.</p><p> The sales reps sat around the conference table with a look of wonder on their faces.  Only one person in the back of the room was smiling broadly and nodding his head up and down.  Turns out he was a new rep who had just joined the team after working for IBM.</p><h3> After I was done with the qualifying piece of the training, this rep raised his hand and told the following story:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I know exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about in terms of fully qualifying leads before setting them up for a demo or appointment.  In fact, the number one rep in our division at IBM had a team of &ldquo;qualifiers&rdquo; who would make the initial calls and then turn the leads over to this guy for his approval.</p><p> &ldquo;This rep (we&rsquo;ll call him Brad), had put together a &ldquo;qualifying checklist&rdquo; of ten items he demanded his qualifiers ask, and if they turned a lead over without at least eight of the questions answered, he&rsquo;d turn the lead back over and tell them to call back and get the rest of the questions answered.</p><p> &ldquo;Now here&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; this rep said, now almost shaking with enthusiasm.  &ldquo;All the other reps would have been happy if three or four of the questions had been answered.  We&rsquo;d all of considered that a good lead to call!</p><p> &ldquo;But not Brad.  Brad wouldn&rsquo;t waste his time with what he called, &ldquo;non-qualified leads&rdquo; because he said he didn&rsquo;t need the practice of trying to close sales.  He said he&rsquo;s only interested in pitching and closing qualified leads.&rdquo;</p><p> And then he dropped the bomb that made believers out of all the other sales reps in attendance:</p><p> &ldquo;And the thing was, Brad was the number one producer in our division and grossed over one million dollars a year in commissions!&rdquo;</p><p> And that&rsquo;s the characteristic you need concentrate on with each and every prospect or &ldquo;lead&rdquo; you generate.  You have to make sure they are fully qualified.  Ask this about every lead before you set a demo or appointment:</p><li> <strong>  Why will this person buy?  </strong> What&rsquo;s their specific buying motive?  Hot buttons?</li><li> <strong>  Why won&rsquo;t this person (or company, etc.) buy? </strong>   What&rsquo;s the likely objection that will kill the deal?</li><li> <strong>  Who are all the decision makers?  </strong> What is this person&rsquo;s role?</li><li> <strong>  Timeline!  </strong> What is the decision process like?  How long will it take?  How many hoops do you need to jump through?  How soon &ndash; or how long &ndash; are they going to take to make a decision on this?</li><li> <strong>  Competition. </strong>   Who are you competing against?  Is their old supplier or vendor still in the mix?  Why would they choose you?</li><li> <strong>  Budget. </strong>   What is your prospect or client looking to spend?  Is your solution perceived as having enough value to justify your cost?  If not, how can you build that? <br/>  </li><p> These are the six basic qualifiers that you need to know about every lead before you enter the closing area.  There may be more given your particular sale, and if so, you&rsquo;d better create your own &ldquo;qualifying checklist&rdquo; and make sure that you know this information well in advance.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If, for some reason, you didn&rsquo;t learn everything on the first call, then consider strongly &ldquo;requalifying&rdquo; at the beginning of your close or demo.

Make a list of the opportunities to meet and engage with members of this group.You can even reach out to your existing clients, in the areas that you chose, to help you. If they are happy with your services, they will probably be amenable to helping you connect in their industry. Women are particularly great at promoting you &ndash; if they like you.When you have your list of the options open to you such as meetings, seminars, conferences, social gathering, library study groups, contact the organizers to find out how you can be helpful. Let them know you are available to participate in their event and discuss what you bring to the table for the members. You&rsquo;d be surprised at how many groups are regularly looking for informed speakers (the value add to their members).Caveat here: If you come to an agreement and you speak at an event do NOT make your presentation a sales pitch. It should be entirely educational, and should address the specific needs of the members. Refrain from even mentioning the name of your organization except in your introduction. If you do it right and come across as genuine and trustworthy &ndash; prospects will come to you after you speak or will remember you when an issue surfaces in their lives that requires a financial solution.Your goal is to have people engage with you at an event that&rsquo;s important to them. Your initial goal is to have people get to know you first before they bother to know what you do and where they will remember you when they need help or are dissatisfied with their current advisor.<h3> <strong>  Take away </strong></h3>Prospecting is hard work: It requires a sales mindset and a commitment (<a href=\"/sell/marketing-to-women/to-grow-your-business-youre-going-to-have-to-do-lot-more-than-be-great-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> step 1</a>), a targeted approach makes it easier (<a href=\"/marketing-women/why-targeting-makes-prospecting-easier\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> step 2</a>), as does connecting with people in the group around their interests (step 3).Learn how to<b> Retain Female Clients</b>through this online course and earn CE credits.

Others perceive Millennials to be open-minded, engaged and optimistic. As a Millennial, I see this generation as a group of individuals that are driven, daring, opportunistic, and so much more. So, as a Financial Advisor, why should you care?</p><li> Millennials are the most educated generation (in American history) with over 63% of Millennials earning a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree ( <a href=\"https://www.aabacosmallbusiness.com/advisor/22-shocking-stats-millennials-help-chart-tomorrow-change-112531305.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Aabaco </a> )</li><li> By 2025, 3 out of every 4 workers globally will be Millennials ( <a href=\"https://www.aabacosmallbusiness.com/advisor/22-shocking-stats-millennials-help-chart-tomorrow-change-112531305.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Aabaco </a> )</li><li> Millennials make up one third of the workforce ( <a href=\"https://www.aabacosmallbusiness.com/advisor/22-shocking-stats-millennials-help-chart-tomorrow-change-112531305.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Aabaco </a> )</li><li> We are worth over  <strong>  one trillion dollars in purchasing power  </strong> ( <a href=\"http://resources.bazaarvoice.com/rs/bazaarvoice/images/201202_Millennials_whitepaper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Bazaar </a> )</li><li> By 2018, Millennials will have the most spending power of  <strong>  any generation  </strong> ( <a href=\"http://resources.bazaarvoice.com/rs/bazaarvoice/images/201202_Millennials_whitepaper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Bazaar </a> ) <br/>  </li><p> As a Financial Advisor, ignoring the Millennial generation means that you are ignoring future and current investors. The future of your businesses could very well lie in the hands (and pockets) of the Millennial generation. So, just how do you reach us?</p><h3> <strong>  We are mobile </strong></h3><p> <br/> Whether it&rsquo;s email, social media, applications, or most importantly web browsing, the smartphone is more than just  a phone  for the Millennial generation. 78% of Millennials spend over 2 hours a day using their smartphones ( <a href=\"https://www.cmocouncil.org/facts-stats-categories.php?view=all&amp;category=mobile-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CMO </a> ). I personally rely on my smartphone for a lot and as a Millennial, there is nothing more frustrating to me then visiting a website that is not mobile friendly. In fact, 30% of mobile users abandon a transaction if the experience is not optimized for mobile ( <a href=\"http://resources.mobify.com/50-mobile-commerce-stats.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mobify </a> ). So, what does this mean for you?</p><p> If you&rsquo;re an Advisor that is trying to market yourself online and are targeting Millennials, it is important to adjust to our digital preferences. Providing your audience with a consistent online experience across several devices will help you stand out from other Advisor websites. A positive user experience will help you build trust, and increase the likelihood of a user returning to your website. This is also great for improving your  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/financial-advisors-driving-website-traffic-improving-search-engine-rankings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  search engine ranking </a>  (to expand your digital reach) as well as  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/content-marketing-tactics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  cultivating a winning brand </a> .</p><h3> <strong>  We are social </strong></h3><p> <br/> 33% of Millennials identify social media as one of their preferred channels for communicating with businesses. To put that number into perspective, only 5% of those 55 and older agree ( <a href=\"http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/channels-preferred-by-age-groups\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  MarketingSherpa </a> ). Whether it is Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, we love our social media. Gone are the days where direct mail is the best form of marketing, to Millennials.</p><p> As an Advisor, some social media platforms are better suited for you and your target audience. LinkedIn, for example, is a great platform to connect with Millennial prospects because they account for 38% (87 million) of LinkedIn&rsquo;s user base ( <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/millennials-on-linkedin-infographic/639859\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SocialTimes </a> ). LinkedIn recently conducted a  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/LImarketingsolutions/financial-advisors-use-of-social-media-moves-from-early-adoption-to-mainstream\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  comprehensive survey of Financial Advisors </a>  and found that 75% of Advisors who gained clients from LinkedIn stated that they use the site to improve their referral network. So, if you&rsquo;re unsure where to start, LinkedIn is a great first step to grow your advisory firm&rsquo;s online presence, strengthen and nurture your relationships, and reach more Millennials.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  We crave content </strong></h3><p> <br/> Millennials are 44% more likely to trust experts than advertisements, and 247% more likely to be influenced by blogs or social networking sites ( <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-to-millennials?__hstc=241978781.726c661bf594166350f225e802cbbe98.1468170983790.1469016539182.1469364458421.7&amp;__hssc=241978781.2.1469364458421&amp;__hsfp=3644121245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hubspot </a> ). It is much more rare for someone to make a purchase as a result of a smooth salesperson. Yet, if an expert whom they admire and trust recommends a products or service, they&rsquo;re sold. Lucky for you, you are an expert in your field. But, do people trust you in the digital space? When building relationships with an online audience, that face-to-face interaction is not there to help build trust. So, how can you get people to trust you in the digital realm?</p><p> Keep in mind that more than 70% of the buyer&rsquo;s journey is completed before a prospect reaches out to you. Nowadays, consumers, particularly Millenials, do extensive research about products and services before choosing which one they are going to go with. Our buying decisions are less influenced by repeated exposure to the same message or brand, but rather built off of conversations and information we receive. In other words, we base our decisions off of the content we are exposed to.</p><p> Content marketing is a great way to engage the Millennial generation.  This technique means helping to solve, educate and inform your audience on problems they may be facing through content. By providing prospects and clients with readily available information online, you&rsquo;re able to build a more trusting and valuable relationship with them. If you were to ask me the benefits of a TFSA compared to an RRSP, I wouldn&rsquo;t have a clue what to tell you. But, just like a lot of other Millennials, I love to learn and would prefer a Financial Advisor that would not only advise but also educate in a non-salesy way. Let&rsquo;s say I was in a situation where I was picking between two Advisors: one has a helpful, informative blog that helps to answer some of my questions without having to contact them.  The other Advisor&rsquo;s website is static with generic content about their business.  As a Millennial, I would definitely pick the Advisor providing informative content on their blog.</p><p> If you are looking to reach more Millennials, you need to ensure that you have a strong digital presence. Remember that we are mobile, social, and crave content. Get started by checking if your website is responsive, sign up and stay active on at least one social media platform, and start blogging. Millennials make up one third of the workforce and soon enough will be worth over one trillion dollars, so ensuring that you reach us digitally is key to the future success of your Advisory Firm.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-24 16:16:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-24 16:16:38.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_plsRIkl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-learn-to-market-to-your-future-investors/\", \"post_id\": \"12682\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-24 16:16:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-24 16:16:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-learn-to-market-to-your-future-investors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12681\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6162\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/advisors-learn-market-your-future-investors.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"715\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469437200,"author_id":195,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5914,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Time Off: 4 Principles for Leaving Others in Charge","link":"time-off-4-principles-for-leaving-others-in-charge","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Summer is here which for many of you means vacation time. And for some who will be heading out on vacation, that reality comes with a heavy sigh at thoughts of leaving the office behind. How will the work get done? Who will handle what needs to be handled? When will digging out from under ever be worth the time away?</h3><p> <br/> Those questions paint the reality of our &ldquo;being too busy&rdquo; culture. And yet time off is an essential part of a self-care regime. According to Dr. Starla Fitch author of Remedy for Burnout, &ldquo;when we don&rsquo;t really step away and recharge, we&rsquo;re just pretending.&rdquo;</p><p> Part of your humanness is the need to renew. And when you don&rsquo;t really step away and recharge, you fail to honor your needs for spending and recovering energy. Study after study reveals the importance in taking time off for well-being, health, creativity and connection. The good news is that you can take the summer vacation and leave the office behind. How?</p><h3> 4 People Principles to Use During Time Off</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Have confidence that others are capable of stepping up </strong> : Believing that you are the only one qualified to do the job properly does not validate those who work for you. Nor does it speak to your ability as a leader to develop your people.</p><p> You should have a least one member of your team who is ready and willing to serve as a single point of contact during your absence. You should also have confidence in selecting representatives for the various recurring meetings you attend. While they will not do the job exactly as you do it, they will do an ample job to keep things moving forward in your absence and shed a positive light on your organization.</p><p> <strong>  Give your authority and responsibilities to those on your team </strong> : As a leader, your responsibilities include talent development and employee engagement. One way to do that is to delegate during your absence.</p><p> As you give authority and responsibility, you are doing three things:</p><li> Stretching their skills and judgment</li><li> Exposing them to people they might not regularly interact with</li><li> Enabling them to see a broader perspective of the business. <br/>  </li><p> Moreover, you are endorsing your team member&rsquo;s abilities and expertise while demonstrating confidence in the accountability you are assigning.</p><p> <strong>  Model the behavior you want to see throughout the organization </strong> : Recognizing and acknowledging the research showing that strategic renewal is critical to boosting productivity, job performance and overall well-being is best done by taking time off. When you step away and return rested and rejuvenated, you model that vacation time provides fuel for energy, creativity, and focus &ndash; all elements of success in your environment. In other words, you talk the talk and walk the walk, giving others in your group to do the same.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> <strong>  Express gratitude for those stepping up:  </strong> As you prepare to leave, note with gratitude your team member&rsquo;s willingness to step up.

{"original_id":5915,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are There Trailblazers in Your Midst?","link":"are-there-trailblazers-in-your-midst","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> A newly released book about Barbra Streisand, singer, actress, movie director and Hollywood star, is drawing attention to trailblazers who opened paths for career women. The book&rsquo;s author, Neal Gabler, referred to Streisand&rsquo;s &ldquo;otherness&rdquo; during recent promotional media appearances.</h3><p> <br/> While Hollywood A-listers aren&rsquo;t typically covered here, the life story of Streisand may be an eye-opener for many readers. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><li> <strong>  She didn&rsquo;t have many people in her corner. </strong> Even her mother doubted her talent and ability. Her father died when Streisand was only 15 months old.</li><li> <strong>  She wasn&rsquo;t accepted by Hollywood. </strong> In fact, the author said she was actively disliked because of her need for perfection. However, he noted that the same behavior from a male director, producer or actor would be called perfectionism, not the negative diva term that was assigned to Streisand.</li><li> <strong>  Streisand was from Brooklyn, with a distinct New York accent. </strong></li><li> <strong>  She was not college educated. </strong> She was a self-taught singer who used that talent to pursue her love of acting, even though she suffered from tremendous stage fright.</li><li> <strong>  Streisand had what critics called a &ldquo;Semitic&rdquo; face, while others bluntly said she needed a nose job. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Her talent and appearance, which Gabler focuses on in &ldquo;Barbra Streisand: Redefining Beauty, Femininity and Power,&rdquo; finally won over some of the critics who judged women more harshly than men. In fact, magazines started to write that Streisand &ldquo;ushered in a whole new taste for beauty.&rdquo;</p><h3> Instead of apologizing for her appearance, she made the most of it.</h3><p> <br/> Instead of bowing to the Hollywood boys club, she fought for her right to direct movies and produce concerts and albums &mdash; a trailblazer indeed.</p><p> Still, while the doors are open to women in Hollywood and elsewhere, there is not equal footing.  There is a significant gender wage gap, and there are still more men in executive positions, board rooms and in the U.S. Congress than women, who make up 50 percent of the population.</p><p> It&rsquo;s good, though, to consider the plight and fight of people such as Streisand in terms of otherness. How do we make room for others in the workplace? Are we as inclusive as we can be? Do we draw out those who are quiet? Do we brand people with words like diva or drama queen?</p><p> To add more context to this Hollywood theme, there is a new network series called &ldquo;Aquarius,&rdquo; which is loosely inspired by Charlie Manson and his followers. The police drama is set in 1967 Los Angeles, starring David Duchovny.</p><p> A detective, Duchovny&rsquo;s character keeps his otherness to himself, telling a fellow officer, who is Cuban, but passing for Irish, that he would never disclose that his father is Jewish. Do people in your workplace think they can&rsquo;t be open about who they are?</p><p> Another &ldquo;Aquarius&rdquo; character is a young police woman who is actively harassed by her fellow officers. Instead of carrying out real police work, she&rsquo;s told to make coffee or get coffee. It&rsquo;s interesting that the only officer who encourages her and takes note of her abilities and potential is the character who is hiding his Jewish background.</p><p> What diverse talents are hiding in your office? Who are your trailblazers?  </p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-24 16:30:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-24 16:30:40.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_6EelukE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-there-trailblazers-in-your-midst/\", \"post_id\": \"12686\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-24 16:30:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-24 16:30:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-there-trailblazers-in-your-midst\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12685\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6164\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/are-there-trailblazers-your-midst.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"385\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469473200,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5916,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Technology Is Matching the Wealthiest Clients With Advisers","link":"how-technology-is-matching-the-wealthiest-clients-with-advisers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The adviser industry continues evolving as innovation and new technology disrupts the status quo. According to Jefferson National&rsquo;s second annual  <i>  <a href=\"http://www.jeffnat.com/advisorauthority\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Adviser Authority  </a>    </i> study <i>  ,  </i> tapping the power of technology is one of the clearest distinctions of the most successful advisers and most affluent investors &mdash; and all advisers should take note.</p><p> This year&rsquo;s study again shows that the most successful RIAs and fee-based advisers are forward thinkers, marketing innovators and technology adopters. This innovative mindset is driving change in our industry &mdash; and all advisers at every level can capitalize on this knowledge to build a more scalable and profitable practice and create a more enduring franchise.</p><p> (We surveyed nearly 700 RIAs and fee-based advisers nationwide, and more than 700 individual investors, from the mass affluent to the ultrahigh net worth. Then we zeroed in on two types of successful advisers: Advisers who individually manage a total AUM of $250 million or more, and high-earning advisers, who earn over $500,000 yearly income from their advisory business.)</p><h3> <b>  TECHNOLOGY DRIVES PROFITABILITY </b></h3><p> <br/> Year over year, the pursuit of profitability continues to be advisers&rsquo; single most important practice management issue. And when asked how they are planning to enhance the profitability of their practice, the push for new clients remains the top driver. More than half (56 %) of RIAs and fee-based advisers say that adding new clients is the top factor for enhancing profitability. Likewise, advisers are focused on targeting more affluent clients (27 %), targeting the younger segments of Generation X and millennials (25 %), as well as attracting and retaining clients&rsquo; heirs (25 %).</p><p> And again this year, it is the successful advisers who say that technology is key to driving profitability. Adding new technology is more likely to be chosen as one of the most important factors to enhance profitability by high AUM advisers (34 %) than the typical adviser (23 %). Likewise, consolidating existing technology is more likely to be chosen as key to profitability by both high AUM advisers (21 %) and high earning advisers (21 %) than the typical adviser (12 %).</p><p> This reinforces the findings of our 2015 study. We learned that the most successful advisers are tech obsessed. They use twice as many technology apps in their practice compared to the typical adviser. The majority of successful advisers evaluate their technology at least weekly, while the typical adviser is more likely to evaluate their technology monthly. Ultimately, we saw that advisers who manage more AUM  <i>  spend </i>  more on technology &mdash; and <i>  use </i>  more technology &mdash; to make their job more seamless and achieve greater scale. The conclusion? For successful advisers, the only thing more expensive than adding technology is  <i>  <u>   not  </u>    </i> adding technology.</p><h3> <b>  THE ROLE OF ROBOS </b></h3><p> <br/> This year we revisited the topic of robo advisers and digital advisory solutions. With volatility identified year over year as the top concern related to investing, protecting their practice and protecting their clients&rsquo; portfolios, we knew it was important to ask both advisers and investors if they are confident that robo advisers can provide proper management and protection for portfolios in volatile markets. The differences are striking &mdash; and reinforced our earlier findings.</p><p> This year we see that most advisers remain divided about the effectiveness of robo advice. While 38 % of advisers say they are confident that robo can provide proper management and protection in volatile markets, a nearly equal number (36 %) are not confident. Likewise, in 2015, we learned that when it comes to robo advice the typical adviser is not on board &mdash; awareness is low, adoption is slow and the jury is still out. <b>    </b> Just one-fifth of advisers use robo advice in their practice, just one-quarter say they are familiar with the robo model, and they are equally divided on the question of whether robo is really an ally or the enemy.</p><p> And yet, when comparing the most successful advisers to the typical adviser, confidence in robo increases considerably. This year, more than half (53 %) of both high AUM and high earning advisers alike say they are confident in a robo&rsquo;s ability to manage volatility. This aligns with our findings from 2015, showing that the most successful advisers are far more likely to be the early adopters of robo advice. They are also employing robo for wealthier and older clients &mdash; contrary to popular belief. More than half (52 %) of the early adopters report that they most often use robo for clients with over $1 million in investable assets&mdash;and a full 20 % say that they use it for clients with over $10 million in investable assets.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> When we asked investors if they are confident that robo advisers can provide proper management and protection for portfolios in volatile markets, one thing is clear &mdash; investors believe that technology is no replacement for guided advice. Only two in ten (21 %) investors are confident that robo advisers can provide proper management and protection for portfolios in volatile markets. Even among the more tech-savvy ultrahigh net worth, only 35 % say they are confident in a robo&rsquo;s ability to manage volatility.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <b>  RELATIONSHIPS MATTER </b></h3><p> <br/> Technology has changed the way that we communicate. But for most investors, relationships still matter and they still seek the human touch. When engaging with their adviser, more than half (53 %) of investors who work with an adviser say they want a high-touch approach. When asked to name their preferred method of communication with an adviser, investors rate phone calls first (35 %), face-to-face meetings second (34 %), and email a distant third (14 %).</p><p> While these numbers are relatively consistent across most investor segments, the preferences shift dramatically for the tech-savvy UHNW. Less than one fourth (23 %) say they prefer a high-touch approach when engaging with their adviser, and more than half (54 %) say they prefer a low-touch approach. For the UHNW, phone calls still rated highest (32 %), while the demand for face-to-face meetings declined (23 %), and email rated a close third (19 %). And although the numbers are low, the affluent are also more receptive to text message, video chat, and social media.</p><h3> Advisers who manage more AUM spend more on technology &mdash; and use more technology &mdash; to make their job more seamless and achieve greater scale.</h3><p> <br/> How is it that the clients with the most complex financial pictures are the ones least likely to want to meet in person? In speaking with elite wealth managers, it becomes clear that these UHNW investors have complicated lives with less time to spare for face-to-face meetings. They prefer the ease and efficiency of instant communication. For these investors, the quality of information is more important the amount of time spent with their adviser.</p><h3> <b>  NO GUIDED ADVICE REPLACEMENT  </b></h3><p> <br/> The most successful advisers understand the importance of adopting more technology and digital solutions to build a more efficient, scalable and profitable practice on the back end &mdash; and an enhanced user experience on the front end. And yet, technology may not be the most important solution for attracting new clients&mdash;not even the tech-savvy affluent investors and younger investors that many advisers seek.</p><p> For example, when we asked advisers which strategies they are implementing to attract the next generation of clients, the number-one answer is working with a current client&rsquo;s family and children, which is tied with increased use of social media, both chosen by 36 % of advisers. Following at a distant second was the increased use of mobile technology, selected by 26 %. We also learned that the most successful advisers place an even greater focus on adopting new technologies to attract the next generation of clients &mdash; more likely to use social media, more likely to go mobile, and more likely to enhance their website and client portal.</p><p> So how did this compare with investors? We asked what would make them more likely to work with a financial adviser, and their priorities were distinctly different. Investors placed much less importance on working with a client&rsquo;s family and children (9 %), increased use of social media (5 %), and increased use of mobile technology (5 %). Even when looking specifically at the next generation of younger investors &mdash; millennials and Generation X &mdash; the percentages increase only slightly to 11 %, 8 %, and 8 %.</p><p> So what is important to investors when they are choosing an adviser? The number-one factor by a wide margin, selected by 46 % of investors, is the adviser&rsquo;s years of experience. This is followed by personalized advice for a holistic financial plan (26 %), and serving clients using a fee-based fiduciary standard (24 %). Most other factors quickly drop to the single digits.</p><p> As our study reveals, investors care about the issues of transparency and fees &mdash; something that all RIAs and fee-based advisers understand. And ultimately, investor optimism increases when working with an adviser. These findings are relatively consistent across all segments of net worth, reinforcing the fundamental principle that technology has its benefits&mdash;and there are many. But in the end, nothing can replace the value of holistic, unbiased, guided advice for attracting new clients and retaining current clients.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-24 16:41:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-24 16:41:39.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_gIVIYj1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-technology-is-matching-the-wealthiest-clients-with-advisers/\", \"post_id\": \"12688\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-24 16:41:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-24 16:41:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-technology-is-matching-the-wealthiest-clients-with-advisers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12687\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6165\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-technology-matching-wealthiest-clients-advisers.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1167\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469433600,"author_id":355,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5917,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When Someone You Love Continues to Repeat Self-Destructive Behavior","link":"when-someone-you-love-continues-to-repeat-self-destructive-behavior","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> If someone lies in the bed they made, you don&rsquo;t have to tuck them in; but you don&rsquo;t have to hop in bed with them either.</h3><p> <br/> It's sad when the consequences of one's choices, especially someone we love, leads them down a path of self-destruction. Of course, it's not up to you to continue throwing it in their face and reminding them of it. However, letting their hardship interfere with your happiness only leads to further self-destruction&mdash;yours. And when you allow their hardship to drag you down, you remove yourself from the ability of ever truly helping them. For when you jump in bed alongside of them, which includes pity and guilt, you essentially have tucked them in very tightly, as well as yourself. This has negative ripple effects on your health and general life satisfaction.</p><p> When someone you love continues to repeat self-destructive behavior, it may be hard to separate yourself from feeling pity or guilt. This is because, as I have spoken often about our primitive nature run by what I call the automatic brain (AB), our innate tendency is to fight or flee anything our brain processes as danger or vulnerability. We all have universal dangers, which I have broken into three components or folders: the danger of being one-upped, the danger of the unknown, and the danger of losing love. What becomes dangerous to us, i.e. what fills up our AB danger folders, depends on our life experience.</p><p> When we throw in someone&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;you made your bed, now you got to lie in it&rdquo; that is our AB fighting or fleeing the danger of being one-upped or taken advantage of by this person. Many doctors respond to patients this way when feeling the patient&rsquo;s lifestyle is the reason for their illness.</p><p> However, when we enable one who continually self-sabotages, we in essence are fighting and fleeing the danger of losing their love. Feeling constant guilt and pity also comes from this brain. Usually an arbitrary set of rules&mdash;commonly a smattering of religious laws and unwritten family &ldquo;values&rdquo;, sets the base; so that when we violate them it makes us feel vulnerable to some higher authority. All these reactions mean we are reacting and being controlled by our primitive AB, and therefore, happiness escapes us.</p><h3> Here are seven steps to living a joyful, productive life despite the self-inflicted hardship of a loved one. <br/>  </h3><li> Never let your disappointment or anger influence how you communicate with this person</li><li> When you are experiencing any type of happiness in your life, don&rsquo;t think about the person. If your thoughts begin to lead you there (as will be the reflex of your AB), don&rsquo;t engage them</li><li> When you find yourself with this person, be with them 100% in the moment, as though nothing happened in the past</li><li> If you have opportunity to help them, do so; however, not at the expense of yourself or your family</li><li> Understand that continual self-destructive behavior is evidence of fight or flight (AB behavior) and likely has resulted from some type of trauma (maybe not overt) from their childhood</li><li> Keep your own house in order first, so that you will be an example as well as a potential resource if the time comes when you can actually help the person</li><li> Come to peace with the idea that the time may never come</li><p> <br/> Although it may be hard, I am confident that following these steps will help you not only function, but thrive, despite a loved one&rsquo;s challenges. Doing so will elevate your mental, physical, and spiritual health.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-24 16:52:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-24 16:52:27.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_CmUUany.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-someone-you-love-continues-to-repeat-self-destructive-behavior/\", \"post_id\": \"12690\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-24 16:52:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-24 16:52:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-someone-you-love-continues-to-repeat-self-destructive-behavior\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12689\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6166\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/when-someone-you-love-continues-repeat-self-destructive-behavior.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2299\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469473200,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

And  second, save regularly regardless of your financial health. This was the adage of a client I dealt with years ago. A lesson learned when her husband of 25 years walked out and left her and their 3 kids in a state of financial shock. As she said, &ldquo;how I wished I had paid attention to our finances over our marriage&rdquo;.  Twenty years later she is retired and fulfilling her dream of travel. </p><h3> How? </h3><p> <br/> Well she had decided to become a student of her own financial health. Her first step was to get a true understanding of the financial situation she was now in. She figured out how much money she needed a month to house and clothe her children. With that in mind she went in search of a job that would pay enough to cover these basic needs.  And then regardless of her financial position every month she put away whatever she could towards her retirement savings. When she finally decided to retire she had over $300,000 invested. In her words,   &ldquo;I started saving just $5 dollars a month. After a few years this had crept up to $25. And by the time the kids had left home I was saving $200 a month. It just became an empowering habit&rdquo;. </p><h3> So what did I learned from this client?</h3><p> <br/> Take responsibility of your own financial health throughout your life,  &lsquo; <strong>  as if you have to&rsquo; </strong> .  This means you should have an understanding of what monies come in and what monies go out. And second, set up a regular saving plan.  The latte factor as it is called. If you are spending $4 a day on that fancy coffee you can surely find $20 a month to put aside for savings.</p><p> Start small if you have to and invest into something you cannot easily access. Take charge of your financial health and make your retirement your responsibility.  As I like to remind my female clients,  <strong>  &ldquo;A Man is not your Retirement Plan&rdquo;.  You are! </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-24 17:28:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-24 17:28:49.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_dMQlQty.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-man-is-not-your-retirement-plan/\", \"post_id\": \"12692\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-24 17:28:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-24 17:28:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-man-is-not-your-retirement-plan\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12691\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6167\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/man-not-your-retirement-plan.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"905\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469455200,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5919,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Common Mistakes New Managers Make","link":"5-common-mistakes-new-managers-make","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Your first leadership role will definitely be a learning experience. Managing people is a very different skill set than managing projects or tasks. A new manager can stumble a little coming out of the gate, so don&rsquo;t let yourself get tripped up by these common first-timer flubs.</p><h3> 1. Being a Micromanager</h3><p> <br/> Even if you make this mistake, you&rsquo;re not alone. A survey by  <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/survey-more-than-half-of-employees-have-worked-for-a-micromanager-265359491.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Accountemps </a>  found that over 50% of employees say they&rsquo;ve worked for a micromanager.</p><p> Now, the bad news is that micromanaging causes serious problems for your team. Take a look at the findings from  <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/survey-more-than-half-of-employees-have-worked-for-a-micromanager-265359491.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  employee surveys </a> ,  <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-09721-001/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  psychological studies </a> , and  <a href=\"http://www.basexblog.com/2005/09/09/cost-of-interruptions-588-billion-and-growing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  market research </a> :</p><li> 68% of employees who&rsquo;ve been micromanaged say it decreased their morale</li><li> 55% of employees who&rsquo;ve been micromanaged say it hurt their productivity</li><li> People who believe they are being watched perform at a lower level <br/>  </li><p> Avoid this problem by establishing a foundation of strong communication. These are the two most important steps:</p><p> <strong>  Get to know your team&rsquo;s capabilities </strong></p><p> Doing this will help eliminate any doubt about your team's ability to execute. This means onboarding them properly (we&rsquo;ll cover that later) and giving them necessary training. Give them productive feedback and check on their progress occasionally. Then trust them to do well.</p><p> <strong>  Get your team to know you </strong></p><p> Let them know what your expectations are. Clearly communicate what they need to know about your role and responsibilities. Keep them in the loop about relevant projects, and share with them your professional vision. When you&rsquo;re open and transparent, you won&rsquo;t need to tell your employees what you want, because they&rsquo;ll already know.</p><h3> 2. Trying to Be the Cool Guy (or Gal)</h3><p> <br/> Yes, you want your team to like you. But remember that you&rsquo;re a boss, not a peer. Here are the dos and don&rsquo;ts you&rsquo;ll need to follow to avoid this common trap:</p><p> <strong>  DON&rsquo;T: </strong></p><li> Avoid saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; because you don&rsquo;t want to be the bad guy. If a team member makes a mistake, bring it up with them respectfully. If you get too many vacation requests at once, don&rsquo;t try to please everyone; just be clear about how you&rsquo;ll treat the requests fairly.</li><li> Avoid setting high expectations or challenging your team so you can be a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; boss. Missing deadlines or losing productivity will put a damper on even the most party-like atmosphere.</li><li> Give team members reason to wonder if someone else in the group is getting special treatment because you&rsquo;re always grabbing lunch or sharing in-jokes with them to the exclusion of others.</li><p> <strong>  DO: </strong></p><li> Let yourself be human and connect with your team &mdash; while sticking to personal boundaries and maintaining equal treatment across the group.</li><li> Make sure your team knows you care about their success by pushing them to develop and stretch themselves.</li><li> Be honest in your feedback, especially when handling criticism. <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Giving Your Team Too Much Room</h3><p> <br/> Hands-off leadership is good. But neglecting your team will kill your rapport. While your employees should be able to work independently, they still need your attention and guidance.</p><p> Remember that you&rsquo;re no longer just one member of the team, and you can&rsquo;t just dive into your own work and never come up for air. Being a leader means being interrupted. Give them your full attention when your employees come to you. If you have to dash to a meeting or take a vital phone call, make sure to follow up later.</p><p> You can also run into this mistake when you&rsquo;re trying too hard to avoid micromanaging. But the solution isn&rsquo;t to cut off contact &mdash; instead, keep communication channels open so you&rsquo;re available whenever your team needs you. Open your office door (literally or figuratively) and be accessible via methods like email and instant messaging. That way you&rsquo;re not smothering them, but they still know how to reach you.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Not Setting Clear Expectations</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t expect your team to be mind readers. Set expectations up front so there aren&rsquo;t any misconceptions about what they&rsquo;re responsible for or how you&rsquo;ll evaluate them. Employees come in with different experiences, so it&rsquo;s better not to assume everyone&rsquo;s playing by the same rules. Make it explicit.</p><p> Clear communication will get you a happier team. How do we know? Findings for our <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/resources/employee-engagement-survey-2013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Engagement Study </a>  show that management transparency is the number one factor in determining employee happiness. Cut the guesswork, and your relationship with your team will flourish.</p><h3> 5. Forgetting to Check in About Employees&rsquo; Professional Goals</h3><p> <br/> Your team isn&rsquo;t just about the day-to-day responsibilities. Employees will look to their leaders to help develop their career path. It might be hard to think that far ahead when you&rsquo;re first starting out as a manager, but make it part of your early conversations with your team.</p><p> Our  <a href=\"http://www.tinyhr.com/2015-tinypulse-best-industry-ranking-report?__hstc=225544837.3526daa8d89fa2757eeb70994ed08b25.1468173224980.1469103925039.1469381563230.5&amp;__hssc=225544837.2.1469381563230&amp;__hsfp=3644121245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2015 TINYpulse Best Industry Ranking Report </a>  looked at the trends impacting employee unhappiness.

{"original_id":5920,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why New Ways Are Needed to Find out How People Truly Feel About Money","link":"why-new-ways-are-needed-to-find-out-how-people-truly-feel-about-money","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Following my call for action of a few articles ago I&rsquo;ve decided to do something about it.</p><p> Since the industry won&rsquo;t listen to me faster and set up new ways of studying how their customers truly feel about money I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;ll take it upon myself to execute on &ldquo;Emotional Banking&rdquo;. Granted, nothing will be valuably scientific and my research utterly and despicably empirical but hey, beats nothing.</p><p> The only rule &ndash; question everything.</p><h3> Spenders and Savers</h3><p> <br/> For instance, why is it that in the rare cases when we define users for our journeys we accept in finance we can use the same data to build personas as in retail? Why not ignore age, gender and occupation and start by splitting people into Savers or Spenders. Isn&rsquo;t that much more relevant for our purposes?</p><p> Then maybe we can see what each values. Whether it is time or money, what makes them tick, check if indeed Spenders value instant gratification and if Savers are more willing to delay it and if so why.</p><p> I spend a lot of time thinking of saving as my readers may know. I&rsquo;m a Spender without a doubt but one that wants to grow up to be a Saver.</p><p> My obsession with this topic started when I helped design To Buy or Not to Buy, Meniga&rsquo;s Finovate winning concept helping people make purchase or saving decisions. (You can see a demo of it  <a href=\"http://finovate.com/videos/finovateeurope-2013-meniga/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> ) It was aimed at creating a mechanism to transform impulse spending into impulse saving instead and it did so by injecting enough information into the decision making process (it allowed users to check if they have enough money for the purchase, to see if they had budgeted for it, etc) but also by making it emotionally engaging (one could crowdsource the decision to their friends on social media if they so chose and more importantly, they could see physical representations of their major savings goals to remind them what the value in saving instead would be).</p><p> Sadly this is the banking industry where we all get excited about things (the concept won Finovate&rsquo;s Best of Show) but do very little about anything &ndash; the app is not live anywhere in the world today so we really have no way of knowing if it would have revolutionised the way we spend. If you think that is too big a claim look at the way Tinder changed the way we date.</p><h3> The Act of Buying</h3><p> <br/> Now what makes someone more likely to spend than others? What is it that makes a Spender? Is it the act of buying or the owning of the object that they are deriving more pleasure from?</p><p> The other day my nanny beamingly informed me that we can likely go through the entire summer without buying my son any new clothes. To her this was good news. To me, it sounded preposterous and sad. I would have more wanted to hear he has outgrown every item of clothing and we need to replace his whole wardrobe. It was going to be majorly expensive but hey, needs must. When she informed me of the opposite I felt loss. It made me question what it was that I would be missing on, why could I not share her enthusiasm at saving all that money. Turns out I had looked forward in my head to the trip where we spend an entire afternoon half listening to his preferences on whether or not T-shirts need to feature Transformers to be approved and half picking up things he &ldquo;needs&rdquo;. Dragging a half reluctant child through overcrowded stores and then handing hard earned cash was a price I was more than willing to pay for the experience of molding his taste, spending time listening to his ideas and feeling like I&rsquo;m setting him up with necessary things as any good parent should.</p><p> So I propose this as a hypothesis: sometimes we buy experiences not things.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s another example -and as I warned you, they are utterly anecdotal- I was speaking to some of my closest girl friends about buying behavior (yes they are FinTech geeks themselves, of course) and while one in particular deserves her own episode in this study as is a hard core Saver and extreme anti-Spender and I am still studying her before I can work out why that is, the other two heard me confess to a somewhat bizarre behavior and could relate to it!</p><p> Sometimes, I fill my basket up online and never check it out. On some sites, such as eBay or Amazon I end up having what is effectively a glorified wish list and I very rarely if ever, buy any of those products because in the cold light of day once I&rsquo;ve cooled off from imagining I will take up yoga I never need the bejewelled mat I had clicked on. Why not have a list instead? Good question, something about a wish list makes it feel less actionable, like a recognised fantasy whereas I want to feel as close to buying that as I can without actually forking the money for it. A really interesting app called &ldquo;Wish&rdquo; goes even further &ndash;intentionally or not- in feeding my need for instant gratification and features an aggregated view of really cheap Chinese products &ndash; clothes, shoes, tech items- and I find myself loading them all into its basket idly as a past time.

All three did so with a blend of nervousness and excitement (and even a \"You can actually  do  that?\").</p><p> And all three have reported feeling more focused and intentional, even in that short time frame.</p><p> I just finished reading a fascinating book called  Deep Work  by Cal Newport. In it, he discusses how as our distractions and interruptions increase, our ability to focus continues to diminish. Cultivating a sense of focus and depth is becoming more rare - and more valuable. </p><p> So, that \"Shiny Object Syndrome\" or \"Oh Look, A Squirrel\"? It's not just you. </p><p> But it's also not going to fix itself.</p><p> Much of my coaching work resides in this area of focus, priorities, and making the most of time. While some changes naturally take a while, others prompt immediate results. Below I offer 5 steps to FOCUS , any one of which you could begin this week:</p><h3> <strong>  Find your rhythm. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Are you a morning person? Night owl? Somewhere in between? Determine what part of the day your energy tends to be highest. Then, to the extent possible, schedule your high-concentration and -creativity projects during those times, reserving lower-energy time for more routine tasks. </p><h3> <strong>  Omit notifications </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> If removing email, social media, and other \"interrupters\" from your phone doesn't seem viable, at least turn off the beeps, pings, and light-up bubbles that appear with each new contact - preferably all the time, but  especially  during your scheduled focus time. </p><h3> <strong>  Clear your space </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> Clutter comes in all forms - physical, mental, noise, and so on. Prompt clarity by cleaning up your physical space, starting with a highly-visible space like your desktop. Don't feel like cleaning? Pack up your project and head to an inspiring locale: botanical gardens, out-of-town coffee shop, hotel conference room.</p><h3> <strong>  Utilize filters </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> And I mean this in the broadest sense possible. Set up filters in your email so non-important messages go right to folders. Filter your to-do list by choosing your Daily Top 3 priorities each morning. Filter your calendar by asking if a request helps you honor your purpose.</p><h3> <strong>  Schedule in focused time </strong> .</h3><p> <br/> Time blocking is a beautiful thing! It requires discipline, but even brief blocks of time reserved for a specific outcome will make a significant difference in your sense of focus and purposeful productivity. Schedule -  <a href=\"http://meaning-and-purpose.com/Blog/tabid/152/post/protecting-your-time-block/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  and honor </a>  - time blocks each week.</p><p> None of these tips is necessarily easy, especially if you've become addicted to those Facebook notifications or \"looking at squirrels.\" ;-) But none of them needs to be difficult either. Choose one, decide why it's important to you, and commit to it for a week. Then, reassess at week's end. </p><p> I bet the moments of focus and clarity you experience will be enough to make you want to continue!</p><p> Which strategy will you commit to?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 13:05:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 13:05:04.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_cqPSBju.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/curing-oh-look-a-squirrel-5-steps-to-focus/\", \"post_id\": \"12698\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 13:05:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 13:05:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"curing-oh-look-a-squirrel-5-steps-to-focus\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12697\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6170\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/curing-oh-look-squirrel-5-steps-focus.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"989\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469556000,"author_id":150,"chart_url":""}

Consider the time devoted to listening and reacting to the pundits and &ldquo;experts&rdquo; who predict what will happen next.</h3><p> <br/> Calculate the attention given to reading the columns of advice aimed at convincing you what stock or fund to buy or sell. Imagine all that time freely given in an effort to be &ldquo;in the know,&rdquo; have an economic advantage, be better informed and have an edge on everyone else (except for those who are watching the same noise, of course).  Needless to say, it&rsquo;s a lot of time, attention and human resource&mdash;all of which are actually devoted to nothing.</p><p> Why nothing? Simple.   Investing,  not speculating, is a long-term strategy&mdash;and by long, we&rsquo;re talking seven or more years. &ldquo;Long-term&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean a day, a week, a month or even a year! The shorter the time period, the greater the risk and the more it becomes gambling. You might be a winner, but the odds are certainly not in your favor.  So why spend all this precious time watching something that is of little or no value? For some, it is the thrill of the game, just like political junkies crave their fix of &ldquo;information&rdquo; and can&rsquo;t turn off Fox News or MSNBC.  For others, it&rsquo;s just a habit, something they&rsquo;ve always done or something their parents did.  But honestly, it&rsquo;s mostly all useless noise wrapped in Wall Street&rsquo;s self-promoted allure of wealth and success.</p><p> Research has clearly shown that stock picking and market timing are rarely successful strategies with any level of consistency. Yes, there are those who are lucky enough to pick a really good stock and those who are lucky enough to buy or sell at the &ldquo;right&rdquo; time, but these successes are few and far between for the average investor. However, the part of our brain that is convinced it is smarter than the market will still keep trying to out-think that which is not out-thinkable.  Then there are those who were lucky enough to pick a great stock and buy it on a timely basis, but when it comes to when to sell or take profits off the table, they become mired in greed. They will more than likely hold too long and watch their winnings fade.</p><h3> A sound long-term strategy for investing consists of two main themes:</h3><p> <br/> allocation and diversification. In other words, it&rsquo;s about where you spread the risk and how much of your hard-earned dollars go into risky versus Safer investments.  The fewer stocks you hold, the greater the upside and downside risk.  By focusing only on the upside, you&rsquo;re liable to take greater risk&mdash;but, it&rsquo;s the downside that&rsquo;ll kill ya!</p><p> Take an investment of $1,000 that is up 10% the first year, down 10% the next year, and up 10% the year after. Your $1,000 is now worth $1,089, up slightly less than 3%.  Another investment of $1,000 that is up 15% the first year, down 20% the next year, and up 15% the year after is now worth $1,058. Clearly, the impact of volatility plays a significant role in your financial outcome.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Regardless of the pundits and experts, volatility happens. How many foresaw oil prices plummeting and the impact on the market in the short term? Chances are, before you blink, some other news or situation will occur that will cause the market to climb or falter. By the time it hits the wires, it&rsquo;s too late to do anything meaningful. In other words, the market will react to news and factor that into current pricing.  Read this to mean: You are not smarter than the market!</p><p> Let&rsquo;s get back to time. Now that you&rsquo;ve been rehabilitated and are channeling your time and energy away from the noise of Wall Street and the media&rsquo;s hysteria, what can you do with that time that will give your life  real  meaning?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 13:07:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 13:07:37.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_nOAxEVm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-would-you-do-if-you-stopped-watching-the-market/\", \"post_id\": \"12700\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 13:07:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 13:07:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-would-you-do-if-you-stopped-watching-the-market\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12699\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6171\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-would-you-do-if-you-stopped-watching-market.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"806\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469520000,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5923,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Be Like Government - Financial Services Must Start Keeping Promises","link":"dont-be-like-government-financial-services-must-start-keeping-promises","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;Superannuation is a component of the social contract between government and the community&hellip; A requirement that superannuation changes be placed on notice, explained and costed will allow for informed feedback and analysis and encourage greater engagement on superannuation and related issues.&rdquo; &ndash; Industry Super Network response to discussion paper: Charter of Superannuation Adequacy and Sustainability and Council of Superannuation Custodians.</p><p> The last 24 hours at the FSC&rsquo;s annual conference covered a lot of ground, but one thing stood out - government (note the lowercase &lsquo;g&rsquo;) and industry are both partly responsible for more than one broken promise to Australians. </p><p> Chief among these broken promises is the implied social contract between government and the Australian people about super, which, if not broken, is at the very least badly cracked. And my fear is that it&rsquo;s going to take more than industry self-regulation and stable super rules to fix it.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take the recent Federal election. We know it was partly fought on the back of the proposed changes to super. Yet this was despite the fact that, according to the Government&rsquo;s own figures, the proposed changes would affect only 4% of Australians.</p><p> Only time will tell just how much damage was done.</p><p> Maybe it&rsquo;s simply a case of super becoming an election issue like any other - a lightning rod for discontent. Commentators across political and national lines have been suggesting for some time that issues like income inequality and other complex social problems without easy answers are what really lie at the heart of otherwise inexplicable events. The resurgence of Pauline Hanson for example, or the economically disastrous Brexit vote.  And maybe super has simply become a symbol of more than just retirement outcomes. </p><p> The problem is that election campaigns, like winning any form of public support, require a deceptively simple narrative. And simple narratives often rely on joining unrelated issues to create a story people can follow. A story they can believe in, and vote for.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s fair to say that right now, a cohesive narrative about super doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p><p> What does exist is discontent with the economy, uncertainty about the future and, I suspect, fear about individual retirement savings adequacy. That discontent was used, and with great success, to burn the Government&rsquo;s proposed super changes.</p><p> Has it also burned super and the sustainability of the retirement savings system?</p><p> Probably.</p><p> Understanding that is central to delivering on our own implied social contract as an industry.</p><p> Behavioural science tells us that, contrary to the economic doctrine of the rational man making rational choices, most of us will NOT in fact act in enlightened self-interest. We won&rsquo;t delay gratification by saving now in order to shore up our future. At the same time the national coffers can&rsquo;t pay pensions the way they used to. Which is why we have forced savings - super - to solve the problem.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> The problem is that most people don&rsquo;t really understand how super works. They just trust - to a point - that everything will be okay. Until it&rsquo;s not.</p><p> So while the vast majority of Australians are not affected by the proposed super changes (notably the lifetime contribution cap of 500k and tax-free retirement accounts capped at the $1.6m balance mark), broad sections of the electorate and media are hopping mad about the changes.</p><p> Yet these are changes that for the most part will actually make the system sustainable. And that&rsquo;s the &lsquo;why&rsquo; which was never clearly communicated. One simple reason is that the Government went straight from Budget to election campaigning, so there wasn&rsquo;t time, as a policy-wise client tells me, to consult on the changes.</p><p> Nor was there time to build a case for them with the public, and therefore build confidence in the story.</p><p> So instead the Government lost seats and reputational equity over super. And the investing public, mostly unaffected by the changes, are madder than hell. </p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> There are merits to the various for and against arguments, and it&rsquo;s not for me to weigh in on policy. But the outcry has implications for the financial services industry broadly. And we have to keep central to our thinking the fact that we too are parties to a clear social contract. </p><p> So what is our social contract?  For me, it boils down to doing the right thing - not to follow the law, or to implement ASIC guidelines, or to clean up after another EU - but to go beyond minimum standards to do the right thing in ways our clients may probably never know.</p><p> In an environment of profound information asymmetry, where we typically have so much more knowledge than our clients, this can be a thankless task. But we will have the satisfaction of knowing it&rsquo;s right.</p><p> Having said that, it is certainly incumbent on us as an industry to implement sensible pro-consumer self-regulation that helps restore confidence in financial services products, institutions and people.</p><p> Restoring confidence will take more than industry self-regulation. Certainly, the task isn&rsquo;t one ASIC can be charged with given the scale of the industry and the limitations of the regulator. </p><p> But it is key to re-building confidence in superannuation, our banks and the financial planning profession.</p><p> As it is to shoring up the social contract to which we are all (willing or otherwise) signatories.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 14:45:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 14:45:26.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_g4W2275.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-be-like-government-financial-services-must-start-keeping-promises/\", \"post_id\": \"12702\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 14:45:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 14:45:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-be-like-government-financial-services-must-start-keeping-promises\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12701\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6172\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dont-be-government-financial-services-must-start-keeping-promises.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"560\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469530800,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5924,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Art of Copywriting: How to Tap Into 95% of Your Prospect's Brain","link":"the-art-of-copywriting-how-to-tap-into-95-of-your-prospects-brain","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Wanna learn the art of copywriting? First you have get inside people&rsquo;s brains. <br/>  </h3><p> One of the primal concepts in the behavioral sciences is that human beings function 95% subconsciously. If you&rsquo;re going to get people to perform a desired action (e.g., act on a lead-gen message), you&rsquo;re looking for a behavior. If people behave 95% subconsciously, it makes sense to direct your lead-gen toward the subconscious mind.</p><p> We recently interviewed Erik Luhrs, the &ldquo;Bruce Lee of Sales and Lead Generation.&rdquo; His background in behavioral sciences enabled him to tap into the brain of his prospects&mdash;and he shared his methodology with us.</p><p> Erik has studied sales messages and saw a lot of appealing content for the conscious mind, giving logical reasons to pay attention: we&rsquo;ll save you money, your quality of life will improve. That&rsquo;s great, but that messaging is not going to activate a prospect&rsquo;s subconscious. If their subconscious mind isn&rsquo;t activated, they&rsquo;re not going to take action.</p><p> This methodology applies to almost any lead-gen message you send: ad copy, website copy, email copy, etc.</p><p> We&rsquo;re going to be looking at how B2B companies can use the subconscious within three sections of their message: the opening, body, and closing.</p><h3> 1) Opening <br/>  </h3><p> You only have one chance to make a first impression. Same thing applies with your messaging. When you put out things that people have heard before (save money ,cheapest widget, best service, etc.), they gloss right over the message because their brain has heard it before.</p><p> Instead of trying to say something you care about, talk to the prospect&rsquo;s subconscious mind. The first thing to do in a message is set context. Context is the answer to the question, &ldquo;What meaning does this message have for your prospect?&rdquo;</p><p> What normally happens is that a prospect gets a message, but it has no meaning to them and doesn&rsquo;t connect with them as a person.</p><p> Instead, you have to know their internal dialogue and, in some shape or form, touch on it. Your linguistics have to make their subconscious mind go, &ldquo;Whoa . . . They&rsquo;re talking to me.&rdquo;</p><p> Ol&rsquo; subconscious mind is used to sitting in a corner talking to itself; it&rsquo;s not used to hearing those same conversations initiated from outside the body. When that happens, it has to pay attention.</p><p> The enteric nervous system in the body is the nervous system that surrounds the throat, stomach, and a few other parts. It&rsquo;s what gives us a &ldquo;gut feeling.&rdquo;</p><p> Your goal, when you send a message to prospects, is to create what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;somatic impact&rdquo; (&ldquo;soma&rdquo; = body). You want the enteric nervous system to be activated with a feeling through your message. That way, the person&rsquo;s body is literally pulling them toward the message.</p><p> For example, imagine if I said the words, &ldquo;carbonated beverage soft drink.&rdquo; In your brain, some synapses fire off and you conceptually know what I&rsquo;m talking about, though you don&rsquo;t feel anything.</p><p> But if I put up the Coca-Cola symbol or just say &ldquo;Coca-Cola,&rdquo; all of a sudden, if you know what Coke tastes like, the taste buds on the back of your tongue start to tingle. You&rsquo;re having a somatic response.</p><p> Then let&rsquo;s say I do the same with Pepsi. If you know what it tastes like and you&rsquo;re a fan, the taste buds on the front of your tongue tingle.</p><p> And if you know what they both taste like, your tongue is having a tug-of-war. Surprise! You&rsquo;re having a somatic response.</p><p> As another example, let&rsquo;s say I want to get the attention of my Coke fans out there. What would happen if I put out a headline that says, &ldquo;Hey, all you Coca-Cola fans, they&rsquo;re thinking about screwing with the formula again. Click here.&rdquo; (Remember the &lsquo;80s, when they created the wretched &ldquo;New Coke&rdquo;? Yikes.)</p><p> Every Coke fan is going to be clicking. Why? Because something that they enjoy has been triggered by a somatic response, and on top of that, it&rsquo;s being threatened.</p><p> They&rsquo;re going to be jumping all over that.</p><h3> 2) Body <br/>  </h3><p> If you get someone past your opening, you&rsquo;re very lucky. According to Erik, we lose 82% of people just based on what we say in our headline.</p><p> We lose an additional 15% of people based on what we say in the body. So at the end of any normal message we have 3% of people left to decide whether they want to respond to our message. With these numbers, it&rsquo;s no surprise that the industry average is a 0.5% response rate. We obviously want to shoot past this measly average.</p><p> Normally, in the body copy people go into a testimonial or mission statement. Or the benefits their product or service offers: gain weight, lose weight, increase productivity, etc.</p><p> If you do that, though, you can lose people in multiple ways. You can lose them through confusion (e.g., you talked about Abraham Lincoln in the headline, but the reader is two paragraphs in and you haven&rsquo;t said anything about Lincoln. Boom, they&rsquo;re gone).</p><p> Or you inflict interest-death-by-article-length. The person might actually be interested, but you decide the email should be 15 pages long. And they think, &ldquo;This looks interesting, but I don&rsquo;t have time for it. I&rsquo;ll put it in my to-do pile.&rdquo;</p><p> Which means they&rsquo;ll never get to it.</p><p> The solution to keeping people&rsquo;s attention from beginning to end lies in the logical progression of content. Make a point to guide people through your message.</p><p> Content in lead generation has two purposes:</p><li> To hold attention from beginning to the end. This is its primary job.</li><li> To tweak a person&rsquo;s mind over the course of a message. At the beginning of content, you want to talk in some way about the pain or problem that they have, and by the end you want to tweak their brain just enough for them to say, &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m interested in this company.&rdquo;</li><p> Remember, the job of your lead-generation message is not to sell everything. Its only job is to get that person to stay to the end.</p><p> An Example: A while back Erik worked with a pricing strategy firm based in California. They were blast-emailing 100,000 people a week. For their efforts, they were struggling to talk to one or two prospects a month and to reach $400,000 a year. Six guys, you do the math&mdash;not very good.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Erik helped them do some research, they chose a target market&mdash;CEOs of mid-market companies&mdash;and they decided that the &ldquo;big thing&rdquo; for their audience was legacy. That was the most important thing to them. (Remember, that&rsquo;s what you should be leading with.)</p><p> The whole point of the email they designed was to take CEOs from legacy to pricing strategy consulting. They connected the dots: you care about legacy, legacy is driven by performance, performance is driven by revenue, revenue is driven by sales, sales is driven primarily by price, price has to be strategic in your marketplace: if you don&rsquo;t have a strategy, you need one. Boom: you need us.</p><p> Six weeks later, instead of this company only getting one to two leads a month, they literally had to stop marketing themselves because they had a several-month backlog of people they had to get back to.</p><h3> Where Does Length Factor In? <br/>  </h3><p> Obviously, message length is a key issue.</p><p> In the movie Get Shorty with John Travolta, there&rsquo;s a scene where Travolta has to go to an Italian mobster and ask something from him. His friend asks, &ldquo;What are you gonna say to him to get him to do this?&rdquo; Travolta responds, &ldquo;Only what I have to&mdash;if that.&rdquo;</p><p> So how little can you say to get your prospects to do what you want? The message is like a part of a rocket. The boosters for space shuttles have got to come off at a certain height, because after that they&rsquo;re a drag.</p><p> Your messages are just like that. You&rsquo;ve got to get them from this stage to that stage to that stage.</p><p> Be very specific. Don&rsquo;t try to fit 20 messages into one. Instead ask, &ldquo;What is the next step I want this person to take?&rdquo; and design your message only around that.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 3) Ending <br/>  </h3><p> The end of the message is a call-to-action.</p><p> You often hear people say, &ldquo;For more information, call 1-800-MORE-STUFF,&rdquo; or &ldquo;To have one of our representatives contact you, fill out this &lsquo;convenient&rsquo; form on the website.&rdquo; Or there&rsquo;s the guy who says, &ldquo;Hey, you don&rsquo;t know me but I&rsquo;m going to be in your area next week. Would you like me to come to your office and bother you?&rdquo; Very compelling stuff.</p><p> These are normal calls-to-action, what Erik calls &ldquo;lame calls-to-action.&rdquo; Instead, you should create a desire-based call-to-action. This type of CTA invites a person to say, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; to not ponder, but take the offer right now.</p><p> And of course, the CTA has to be in alignment with what you&rsquo;ve been talking about up to that point.</p><p> The example story Erik tells is one from when he started out as a business coach. In the beginning, he had a lot of clients, but they weren&rsquo;t paying him much money, he was spending 12 hours a day on the phone, and he couldn&rsquo;t think straight.</p><p> He ended up saying, &ldquo;Okay, I want more clients, but I need to jettison some of the clients I already have for better-paying clients so I can work less and make more.&rdquo; He jettisoned them so fast that suddenly he was scraping nickels and had to bust it to get enough appointments.</p><p> When he was doing that, reaching out and saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a phone call,&rdquo; nobody was responding. He went to one of his mentors. She looked up what he was doing&mdash;and laughed.</p><p> &ldquo;Look Erik,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re calling people all day long saying &lsquo;meeting or phone call.&rsquo; They have meetings and phone calls throughout the day already with people they already know for reasons they already understand. Why should they talk to you?&rdquo;</p><p> He had no response.</p><p> The next day, instead of offering a phone call he offered a money jumpstart session. &ldquo;Money&rdquo; because these were small business owners who wanted more money, &ldquo;jumpstart&rdquo; because it was an action word, and &ldquo;session&rdquo; because it sounded better than &ldquo;meeting.&rdquo;</p><p> He offered to point out the holes in their business and identify at least one strategy that they could use in the next 90 days or less to increase their business.</p><p> He&rsquo;d fallen well below six figures when he dropped his first batch of clients, but within three months he was back up over six figures, and he never looked back.</p><p> It wasn&rsquo;t because he changed anything he provided; it was simply about how he positioned his call-to-action that made all the difference.</p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> Spend all your efforts appealing to the conscious awareness of prospects, and your messages will fall flat. But tailor your copywriting to appeal to their subconscious minds, and you&rsquo;ll strike a note they didn&rsquo;t know could be played.</p><p> Or less poetically, you&rsquo;ll get them to give you money. Which is pretty cool, too.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 14:47:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 14:47:35.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_2o9gU1R.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-art-of-copywriting-how-to-tap-into-95-of-your-prospects-brain/\", \"post_id\": \"12704\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 14:47:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 14:47:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-art-of-copywriting-how-to-tap-into-95-of-your-prospects-brain\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12703\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6173\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/art-copywriting-how-tap-95-your-prospect-s-brain.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"819\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469541600,"author_id":208,"chart_url":""}

I have witnessed many talented advisors struggle in the wirehouse world, unable to grow their books to a meaningful asset level, who were able to ultimately expand their production exponentially after moving to a bank brokerage unit.</p><p> A bank advisor&rsquo;s business development role goes from solely marketing to prospective end-clients to developing strong relationships with commercial, mortgage and private bankers, branch managers and other centers of influence within the bank so that those folks will get comfortable referring prized clients.</p><p> While a move to a bank&rsquo;s wealth management unit may be a great way for an advisor to build his business, there are some potential pitfalls to be aware of:</p><li> Bank assets tend to be &ldquo;stickier&rdquo; to the bank, so an advisor that has built his book on referrals from others within the bank may find that when it comes time to leave the nest, it is much harder to do so with his book intact.</li><li> Any firms recruiting bank brokers know that their books are typically less portable than traditional advisors, so their businesses will often be discounted when being considered for recruitment. Further, recruiting managers at traditional firms are almost always suspect of a bank advisor&rsquo;s ability to prospect for new business, presuming that the advisor was completely reliant on the bank for referrals. While this may not be true, it does mean that when being recruited, an advisor has to work harder to prove his worth.</li><li> Banks are notoriously more bureaucratic than traditional wealth management firms and so their advisors often complain of having less control, entrepreneurial freedom, and feeling more limited.</li><li> The community in a bank can be easy to outgrow as an advisor crosses that million-dollar threshold in terms of annual production, and begins to service an increasingly higher net worth client base. These top-of-the-food-chain advisors often seek like-minded advisors with whom they can exchange ideas; when most of their colleagues are managing much smaller books of business, thought leaders and trailblazers will be much harder to find.</li><li> Though the notion of growth via referrals is the main appeal for joining a bank&rsquo;s wealth management unit, some of the time (depending upon the bank and the market), those referrals are few and far between&hellip;and the advisor is, therefore, left having to build his business as he would in any other environment. <br/>  </li><h3> Outgrowing your space: What happens when you have no room to grow? <br/>  </h3><p> Consider an advisor named &ldquo;Sally&rdquo;. She graduated from college in 2001 and began her career in wealth management immediately afterwards as a rookie advisor for a well-respected commercial bank.</p><p> For more than a decade, she loved her job, her colleagues, how much she learned and how much her business had grown (to almost $500 million in client assets as of last year). But, as Sally began to service a more sophisticated and high net worth client base with the average net worth in the $3-10 million range, she knew that these discerning folks were looking to her for more creativity, an open architecture set of investment and lending solutions, and better technology. And, as the #1 advisor in her organization, there weren&rsquo;t many other advisors that she could look to who had similar success or even the growth mindset to better serve clients.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> As a result, Sally left the bank earlier this year and is literally knocking the cover off the ball at a wirehouse firm. She reported that the biggest motivation for changing jerseys was the realization that 100% of the new business she brought in during the last 5 years she was with the bank had not come from the bank itself but as a result of her own efforts and referrals from her loyal clients and centers of influence.</p><p> The bank had been giving her access to its platform, but not much else. While the new firm took some convincing that her book was definitively tied to her and that she was capable of continuing to grow it outside the confines of the bank, Sally was ultimately paid an aggressive transition package and moved more than 95% of her book. She has already landed two multi-million dollar clients and has been given additional sales support to help her drive momentum.</p><p> Bank advisors who have become more self-sustaining (that is, less reliant on the bank for referrals) often seek more flexibility in running their business and servicing their clients. It&rsquo;s at this point that they feel that the cons of working for a bank outweigh the pros.  That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing; it tells us that in most cases, being a bank advisor served as the springboard it was meant to, accelerating growth in ways that would not have been possible in any other environment. As long as the advisor is aware of the potential pitfalls associated with this as a career strategy, it&rsquo;s a great way to get from point A to point B.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 14:50:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 14:50:41.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_J47RT4e.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/banking-on-growth-what-happens-when-advisors-have-no-room-to-grow/\", \"post_id\": \"12708\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 14:50:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 14:50:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"banking-on-growth-what-happens-when-advisors-have-no-room-to-grow\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12707\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6175\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/banking-growth-what-happens-when-advisors-have-no-room-grow.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"833\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469527200,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5927,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Trust, the Best Financial Advisor Marketing Strategy","link":"trust-the-best-financial-advisor-marketing-strategy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s no word I&rsquo;ve heard offered more when I ask advisors and RIAs what separates them from their competition. It&rsquo;s such a predictable response I&rsquo;ve been thinking of changing my business model to, &ldquo;If I guess the four things you think separate your firm from your competition, do I win a prize?&rdquo;</p><p> # 1 &ndash; Our clients trust us <br/> # 2 &ndash; We have integrity <br/> # 3 &ndash; We put the clients&rsquo; interests first, and <br/> # 4 &ndash; We offer comprehensive planning</p><p> A close 5th is the use of the term &ldquo;holistic planning&rdquo; in lieu of the aforementioned &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo;.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not easy articulating your story &ndash; if it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t have this job. It&rsquo;s even more difficult to articulate from a client&rsquo;s perspective what makes you different and valued; so that&rsquo;s a story for another day.</p><p> For now, let&rsquo;s break down the first item, &ldquo;trust&rdquo;, in a way that will help you attach, market, and promote your value.</p><h3> Trust, and Why it&rsquo;s Critical to Success</h3><p> Trust, or the lack thereof, is an issue when it comes to sales, profitability, client retention, client relations and referrals.If people don&rsquo;t trust you, and why should they, it takes a lot more work (actually, it&rsquo;s almost impossible) to get them to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. &ldquo;Trust&rdquo; is instrumental in achieving success; its influences are wide spread.</p><li> Trust increases sales.</li><li> Trust improves profitability because you spend less energy pushing for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</li><li> Trust enhances relationships so you get better information from clients and greater share of wallet.</li><li> Trust improves client retention &ndash; and it&rsquo;s common knowledge that it&rsquo;s more profitable to keep clients than to replace them.</li><li> Trust breeds passion and advocacy from clients and centers of influence which leads to more and better referrals. Trust is a highly shareable story.</li><li> Trust engages prospects sooner. It speeds up the sales cycle.</li><h3> Myths and Realities <br/>  </h3><h3> There are many misconceptions about trust. Let&rsquo;s separate some common misconceptions from reality.</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Trust-Myth-Realties-Table.jpg\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3> The Attributes of Trust <br/>  </h3><p> The following are four attributes of trust: Integrity, Motivation, Predictability, and Competence. Understanding these and applying what you can to your sales and marketing may make a significant improvement in your advisor marketing results.</p><h3> Integrity <br/>  </h3><p> This attribute describes how ethical, honest or moral you are. It may be better described by one&rsquo;s willingness to act ethically. Next to the word &ldquo;trust&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s the second most common adjective I hear when I ask financial firms or professional to describe how they are different or better than their competitors. It&rsquo;s powerful that most professionals value its importance, it&rsquo;s disturbing that so many think it&rsquo;s a point of differentiation.</p><p> Integrity may come down to the finer details. Do you do what you say you are going to do? What standard are you held to or do you hold yourself to professionally? Fiduciaries have a clear advantage here. Can you prove you have integrity in advance or in your financial advisor marketing?</p><h3> Motivation <br/>  </h3><p> When clients feel your motivation align with theirs, trust is enhanced.</p><p> Can you prove your motivations, your purpose, and your passions are aligned with your clients&rsquo;?</p><h3> Predictability <br/>  </h3><p> Predictability reduces uncertainty. Mayer et all consider predictability as a factor that influences the cooperation between two people1.</p><p> Can you enhance your predictability so it positively influences trust? <br/> A well-articulated planning process goes a long way to increasing predictability, especially if the professional adheres to it.</p><h3> Competence <br/>  </h3><p> Competence can be specific or general; it&rsquo;s one&rsquo;s ability to complete a task. As a financial professional or firm, you need to be clear about where your competence lies and how you can prove it.</p><p> Do you have general of specific competence and how can you prove it?</p><h3> You Build and Achieve Trust when&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> You and Your Advisor Marketing Are Believable</p><p> People&rsquo;s intuition can be both rational and emotional. Rational intuition considers what you present to your audience &ndash; you can control what they see and experience. Emotional intuition is a gut-feeling people have about you. It could be based on their past experiences and you may not be able to control how they feel about you. If you are a good listener, professional, and they can relate to you, you should fair well.</p><p> Tips:</p><li> Be professional and relatable in how you speak, dress and present yourself.</li><li> Less marketing copy, more tangible proof that you are what you say.</li><li> Choose real words over jargon.</li><li> Give examples of what you do, how you do it, why you do it and who you prefer to do it for.</li><h3> You Build and Achieve Trust when&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> You Have Clear Competencies (general or specific)</p><p> There something incredibly frustrating about visiting a website and not being able to put your finger on what they do. Most people will leave quickly, hence the need to make what you do, and who you do it for clear and concise. What you do should focus on your core competencies. There&rsquo;s no need to say you do everything under the sun, unless that&rsquo;s your strength and your audience needs to see that. There&rsquo;s value in saying what you do best and sticking with that. People like experts &ndash; it says competence and breeds confidence.</p><p> Tips:</p><li> It&rsquo;s better to be specific than broad.</li><li> Being specific doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t do more, it just says we do this best and if that&rsquo;s what you need most, we&rsquo;re a great fit.</li><li> Use credentials and experience to support you competency claim.</li><li> Use checklists of questions or common mistakes to showcase your expertise.</li><li> Write blog posts about your area of expertise.</li><li> Build your brand around your competencies and your audiences&rsquo; needs.</li><li> Demonstrate your commitment to being a leading expert through your affiliations and the groups/publications you follow.</li><h3> You Build and Achieve Trust when&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> You Give and Never Ask (social media is about giving, not asking)</p><p> One of the first and greatest lessons people get when they have their social media epiphany is, &ldquo;when I give, I get&rdquo;, and &ldquo;when I ask, I&rsquo;m completely ignored and often ridiculed.&rdquo;</p><p> Tips:</p><li> Give what you write/own versus always curating other peoples&rsquo; ideas/content.</li><li> Give generously; make sure there&rsquo;s value in everything you offer for free and ensure it not salesy.</li><li> Examples of things to give include: papers, checklists, assessments, targeted calculators, DIY worksheets (budget or net worth), visuals that simplify concepts, tax guides, and seminars.</li><li> Links to useful tools and information. Content curation (promoting other peoples&rsquo; ideas) works good when there is significant value to your audience. For example, providing a link to a timely tax guide put out by a local accounting firm that helps people plan their personal tax filings could be highly valued.</li><li> Inspire people with links to stories of success, and failure, in life and wealth.</li><li> Start conversations about important topics and bring together experts to answer questions.</li><h3> You Build and Achieve Trust when&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> You Are Clear About Who You Work With And Why (clear target audience)</p><p> There&rsquo;s some redundancy with &ldquo;competencies&rdquo; above but it&rsquo;s important to know who your ideal audience is and what resonates with them. &ldquo;Why&rdquo; you choose to serve this group can be very powerful too.</p><p> Tips:</p><li> Clearly articulate your audience in your marketing.</li><li> In your marketing, use images, fonts, and words that resonate with your audience.</li><li> The media you choose also be appropriate for your audience. Choose wisely. A podcast may not work well with seniors but it may work great with busy professionals who commute in New York city.</li><li> Write a statement about &ldquo;why&rdquo; you do what you do. Watch Ted Talks speech by Simon Sinek and listen as he shares how important &ldquo;why&rdquo; is.</li><h3> You Build and Achieve Trust when&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> People Can Experience Your Brand Before Committing (defined process, approach)</p><p> The Internet makes it much easier to share your client experience with prospects. You can visually present &ldquo;how&rdquo; you work with people, the process you take them through and the results they can expect from your proven process. You can use video to share your approach to investing with a professionally narrated voiceover, animated concepts and clear explanations less achievable with words alone.</p><p> Tips:</p><li> Define and then diagram your planning process. Make it more interesting and tie it into your brand.</li><li> Define and diagram your investment philosophy.</li><li> Create a video introduction to your firm. Make it easy for people to know (in 90 seconds) what talking with you would be like &ndash; professional, courteous, intelligent and so on. Hire a professional video recording company. The quality of the video speaks volumes.</li><h3> You Build and Achieve Trust when&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> You Have A History Of Doing What You Say (proof of the pudding)</p><p> I like to refer to this as &ldquo;being your brand&rdquo;. If your brand says you have a process, stick to that process. If your brand says you make peoples&rsquo; lives easier, make it easier with video conferencing, access to their financial plan online, regular net worth statements so they see the big picture and so on. Advisors who do what they say build incredible bonds with their clients. Being known for &ldquo;getting things done&rdquo; can be a huge asset for getting referrals and retaining clients for extended relationships.</p><p> Tips:</p><li> Explicit testimonials aren&rsquo;t typically allowed but ask your compliance department what is. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll allow photos of clients at your appreciation events or enjoying their lives.</li><li> Create a list of action steps and assign tasks after every meeting with clients so they can visually see that you are following through with your tasks. This also helps keep them accountable to their own assigned tasks. Clients will often forget it was them that were the bottleneck if they don&rsquo;t see they missed the deadline or task as assigned.</li><li> Go beyond the typical reporting and planning that clients expect; wow them. We developed a Net Worth Tool (spreadsheet) for a client years ago and they tell us it&rsquo;s the single most powerful tool they use with their high net worth clients. They use this at every annual meeting and clients love it. They went beyond the typical statement review or financial plan review; they show clients their net worth momentum.</li><h3> You Build and Achieve Trust when&hellip; <br/> <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;re Easy To Engage With (download paper, attend seminar, meet for coffee)</p><p> Advisors&rsquo; websites typically don&rsquo;t make it easy to engage with them &ndash; on any level. For example most advisors&rsquo; sites have a contact us form or a newsletter sign up but few have papers people can download, video they can watch, tools or reports they can review, processes they can visualize and so on. When you share more about helping people with what you know, who you are, how you operate, and what you do for people, it becomes so much easier to experience what working with you would be like. Interestingly, most sites don&rsquo;t have clear and compelling call to actions. If you want people to download your paper, &ldquo;10 Brilliant Ideas to Make Your Financial Life Easier&rdquo;, it needs to be featured and with a big bright button, DOWNLOAD NOW or something to making engaging your site easier. I frequently find the best &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; buried deep on advisors sites with no call to action and no eye candy saying, GET IT NOW.</p><p> Tips:</p><li> Feature content and ideas that build instant credibility.</li><li> Use big, colorful and simple buttons to engage people, CLICK HERE, DOWNLOAD NOW, REGISTER TODAY.</li><li> Turn your contact us form into &ldquo;Schedule a Coffee Session&rdquo;. Be creative and interesting.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t oversell but make sure the benefits of &ldquo;acting&rdquo; are clear and concise.</li><li> Have multiple levels of engagement available. Some people won&rsquo;t bite on &ldquo;schedule free consultation&rdquo; but they may &ldquo;download&rdquo; or &ldquo;sign up&rdquo; or &ldquo;attend&rdquo; or &ldquo;read more&rdquo; or &ldquo;share this article&rdquo;.</li><li> Make sure it&rsquo;s easy to share your content via social media.</li><h3> In Summary <br/>  </h3><h3> Trust is a cornerstone to marketing your financial advisor practice and selling your financial services. Don&rsquo;t get complacent with how you build trust. Find new ways to enhance how you build trust and how easy you make it for people to begin trusting you. Think about the how we market these days, don&rsquo;t be afraid of change. Embrace change. Embrace &ldquo;trust&rdquo; and be a leader in attracting, engaging, influencing and building high quality relationships.</h3><p> Trust is the best financial advisor marketing strategy. </p><p> &ldquo;Trust in the old economy was the natural outcome of a select few, great organizations. Today, it is the price of entry into the new, global economy.&rdquo; &ndash; Steven Covey</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 14:52:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 14:52:53.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_8fEZJtF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/trust-the-best-financial-advisor-marketing-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"12711\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 14:52:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 14:52:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"trust-the-best-financial-advisor-marketing-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12709\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6176\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/trust-best-financial-advisor-marketing-strategy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1042\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469523600,"author_id":284,"chart_url":""}

As a result of travelling a great deal, I often write about my experiences of doing so. Some of the best and worst experiences I have ever had have been whilst travelling.</p><p> I acknowledge how lucky I am to go to the places I do and want to apologise to those who tire of reading about my highs and lows around the world. I also want to apologise for writing in a negative sense about a brand. I never get any pleasure from sharing poor Customer Experiences &ndash; so many of the people who work for the companies I write about are trying their very best for their customers &ndash; yet I write about them when I feel that other companies can learn from understanding how to leave customers with memories &ndash; both for the right and the wrong reasons.</p><p> Now I have my apologies out of the way, let my rant begin&hellip;.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"523\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/British-Airways-Fail.png\" width=\"738\"/></p><p> It does not matter where you come from around the world &ndash; everyone knows British Airways. Even if you have never had the opportunity to fly, BA is an iconic global brand. Over the years, I have flown with them many, many times and have written about them positively&hellip; and not so positively!</p><p> As a proud Brit, flying with BA has often felt like a comfy pair of slippers &ndash; dependable; reliable; positively British &ndash; getting on a BA plane has regularly felt quite comforting. Yet in recent times, BA&rsquo;s dependability has started to wane &ndash; and quite significantly. I am frequently told by colleagues and peers that they purposely choose not to fly with BA. Words like &lsquo;bland&rsquo; and &lsquo;corporate&rsquo; are used in association with the airline &ndash; one person suggested that BA was positively &lsquo;boring&rsquo;.</p><p> I actually think that boring is not always a bad thing when flying &ndash; as long as it &lsquo;does what it says on the tin&rsquo;, then most customers are happy. However, this is where the problem comes. BA is NOT a low-cost carrier. Whilst Ryanair have made &lsquo;doing what it says on the tin&rsquo; a profitable art form, BA&rsquo;s proposition promises so much more. When you expect more from any brand, it is a significant disappointment when that brand fails to meet your expectations.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/British-Aiways-Club-World.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> In the last eighteen months, I have flown in BA&rsquo;s long haul business class (Club World) on multiple occasions. The amount of money that has been paid for my multiple trips runs into tens of thousands of pounds. You would think that if a customer is spending significant sums of money that they would receive exceptional and consistent experiences from that company. You would be thinking wrong.</p><p> Only a few weeks ago, on a flight back to the UK from Accra in Ghana, the cabin crew completely &lsquo;forgot&rsquo; to serve me my meal &ndash; yes &ndash; completely &lsquo;forgot&rsquo;. I was eventually served my meal with a hollow apology. If you can believe it, they then forgot to serve me breakfast &ndash; by the time they realised, it was too late to serve it to me. For an experience costing a few thousand pounds, it was not acceptable.</p><p> Ironically, I am writing this post on another BA flight &ndash; this time to Newark in the US. On this occasion, it took over 40 minutes to serve my main meal &ndash; everyone else had been served theirs. I did get an apology&hellip;. Eventually&hellip; but it is just not good enough. Now it may well be I am doing something wrong &ndash; I do sometimes ask if it is just me &ndash; but anyone who travels with me will know that I am the nicest possible passenger you could ever have &ndash; unless something goes wrong that is!</p><p> Yet these meal misdemeanours pale into insignificance with the events of the last three weeks or so. You may not be aware that BA has upgraded their computer systems. If you did not, you may also be unaware that the implementation of this system has been an un-mitigating shambles.</p><p> To cut a long story short, the system is not working properly. I experienced this for the first time two weeks ago when travelling back from Johannesburg to Heathrow. It took the check in staff ninety (90) minutes to check me in &ndash; you read that correctly &ndash; I stood at a check-in desk for ninety minutes. The reason &ndash; I still do not know. They kept claiming there was a problem with my ticket. Several calls to my travel agent in London later (at my cost), it was clear that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my ticket. During the ninety minutes, I was not once offered a glass of water &ndash; or somewhere to sit. In fact, it was not until the duty manager for BA arrived an hour in to the debacle that anyone apologised for the wait.</p><p> At the ninety-minute mark, the duty manager asked the check in staff to take me through to the lounge &ndash; promising me that the problem would be sorted and my correct boarding passes given to me at the gate. Did that happen &ndash; of course not. Once again, I stood at a desk at the gate for another thirty minutes while someone tried to sort the problem out. Eleven hours later, when I got to the gate for my connecting flight to Manchester, the problem was still not rectified &ndash; I do not know if it ever was &ndash; an atrocious experience for an experience that once again cost multiple thousands of pounds.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/British-Airways-Fail1.png\" width=\"460\"/></p><p> The volume of passengers experiencing BAs computer system shambles runs into the many thousands. Today it took me over an hour to check in to my flight at London Heathrow &ndash; and I was in the first class queue &ndash; I hate to think how long it took others to check in. During my time in the queue, I did not spot a single member of BAs management &ndash; not a single one. Not one person offered anyone an apology. There was not a single announcement over the tannoy explaining what was going on. Think about passengers with young children &ndash; or elderly passengers &ndash; having to stand for hours without any explanation. There is no doubt that organisations sometimes take their customers for granted &ndash; airlines are pretty good at that &ndash; and this is an exemplary case. What was even more remarkable was that beyond the departure hall, no-one seemed to be aware of the problem &ndash; from security to the BA lounges, to the crew on my plane &ndash; no-one had been told there was a problem. Appalling.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> BA have spectacularly failed me in the last two weeks alone &ndash; just because I have a gold card, do not ever think that I am your hostage. I do not want compensation &ndash; I do not want sympathy &ndash; I want BA to genuinely and sincerely acknowledge what they have done to their customers in recent weeks. I want them to genuinely and sincerely apologise to any passenger who has been struck by their inability to implement a computer system correctly. I want them to communicate with and reassure their frequent customers what is being done to ensure that they are not inconvenienced going forward. I think they owe us all of this&hellip; and it is not too much to ask. I also want others to learn from this. Things go wrong &ndash; human beings understand and accept that &ndash; but not dealing with things that go wrong in a genuine and empathetic way will have consequences.</p><p> I hope BAs senior leadership read this &ndash; I will be sending it on to them. I hope that the next time the computer system fails (which I expect it will), they have the courage to go out and face their customers &ndash; and do not leave it to the very hard working and beleaguered ground crew &ndash; they are trying their best in very difficult circumstances. Will I keep flying with BA? Now that is a question &ndash; we will have to wait and see&hellip;</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 14:55:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 14:55:01.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/how-british-airways-spectacularly-failed-its-customers-and-damaged-its-brand.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-british-airways-spectacularly-failed-its-customers-and-damaged-its-brand/\", \"post_id\": \"12716\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 14:55:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 14:55:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-british-airways-spectacularly-failed-its-customers-and-damaged-its-brand\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12712\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6177\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-british-airways-spectacularly-failed-its-customers-and-damaged-its-brand.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1192\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469552400,"author_id":200,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5929,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Blockchain Is Like the Internet Before the Browser","link":"why-blockchain-is-like-the-internet-before-the-browser","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  WARNING WARNING WARNING: This is a semi-technical article and it is rather long (20 minute read). If you don&rsquo;t like dealing with bits and bytes, you may want to turn away now. </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ve been meaning to also write a blog update on all things about blockchain for a while, but just haven&rsquo;t had time.  As it&rsquo;s summer, I now have more time, so here goes.</p><p> Blockchain is a confusion because there are so many variations. The bitcoin community claim the only blockchain that matters is theirs, because they have the most market value invested in their currency. The problem is that the bitcoin blockchain isn&rsquo;t very useful in the context of finance and government, due to its restrictions.</p><p> Its restrictions include that it is decentralised but the more the blockchain grows, the larger the requirements become for storage, bandwidth and computational power.  In fact, it demands more  full nodes  (see endnote) in the network, leading to a risk of much higher centralization if the blockchain becomes large enough that only a few nodes are able to process a block.</p><p> Secondly, the bitcoin-specific issue is that the blockchain has a built-in hard limit of 1 megabyte per block, which is the reason why validating transactions takes at least ten minutes and sometimes over an hour.  As I write this, the bitcoin network is processing just under 10,000 transactions an hour, which is around 160 transactions per minute or less than three transactions second. Removing this limit requires a &ldquo;hard fork&rdquo; to the bitcoin protocol, which is unacceptable to most as it means it invalidates the existing network and all of its history.</p><p> There is also due to the above two reasons, a high processing fee charge incurred for bitcoin transactions, and the potential for those fees to increase as the network grows.  When looking at this, we can see that each block verification rewards a miner with 12.5 bitcoins (this halved recently from 25). At current exchange rates, that equates to $8,150. The network currently processes around 1,500 transactions per block for an average cost of $5.43 per transaction (it was $23 two years ago, so it&rsquo;s come down a lot, and is more accurate than the figures shown on blockchain.info).</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> In other words, the core issues of bitcoin are that it has to move to centralisation to scale and that would defeat its purpose.  As a result, it is a high cost, low volume processing system. Some believe this is a non-issue, such as well-known bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos.  In a talk at CoinJar last fall, he made the following comment: &ldquo;I have no worries that bitcoin can scale, and the simple reason for that is that I know that IPv4 can&rsquo;t, and yet I use it every day.&rdquo;  However, bankers will not commit to such a network.  There are other reasons why banks could not use such a network including transparency.  The bitcoin blockchain allows anyone to see a transaction and its history.  That won&rsquo;t work for a secure market where only counterparties should see transactions.</p><p> This is why Ethereum has taken off as the bitcoin alternative.  Ethereum has its own currency, the Ether, and is the second most capitalised cryptocurrency out there.  It&rsquo;s the backbone of many developments from Microsoft&rsquo;s blockchain-as-a-service to the Bank of England&rsquo;s next generation real-time gross settlement (RTGS) developments.</p><p> Now this could be slightly concerning if you&rsquo;ve been following the recent events of the DAO, the Decentralized Autonomous Organisation.  The DAO is a computer program built by Simon and Christoph Jentzsch that doubles as an investment fund. It lets users invest their money into the investment vehicle, which will pick companies to invest in by gathering votes from investors who hold DAO tokens. Built on the Ethereum blockchain&mdash;a platform for secure transactions&mdash;it quickly became the biggest crowdfunding project in history raising $150 million in a month.  Then a whole pack of that investment fund was hacked, with over $50 million in Ether stolen.  The result is that, unlike the bitcoin approach, Ethereum determined a hard fork in their currency was needed which went live yesterday.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> A fork can be a soft or hard rollback to reset the network, like a reboot.  The initial proposal was a soft fork. This would entail a majority of the Ethereum miners (those who verify transactions on the network) voting on the roll back. Unfortunately, a security flaw was found in the voting process, which eliminated this option.</p><p> That leaves a hard fork, where the core developers of Ethereum unilaterally make the decision to essentially create a new version of the network with different rules than the original. Then, miners, exchanges, and other major apps that are built on it need to decide if they want to a part of the new version of Ethereum or the original.   Luckily for Ethereum about 80% of their community have so far upgraded to support the process, so it should succeed.  But it does raise questions and hit confidence in the process.  Equally, Ethereum is also scalability challenged, processing just 100 transactions per second today.</p><p> This is why there are other blockchains out there that might be more robust to better serve the banking community, such as BigchainDB, Ripple and R3CEV Corda.  That&rsquo;s not an exhaustive list, as there are others out there like SafeCash and HyperLedger, but I choose these three as being the ones of most relevance to financial institutions and their use cases at this time.</p><p> BigchainDB is a new blockchain development that overcomes the scalability issues of bitcoin blockchain.  Released in February 2016, it generated a lot of hype due to impressive scalability benchmarks: it was able to process a million transactions per second.  BigchainDB also got a lot of praise from private blockchain enthusiasts with many partnerships including Eris Industries, Everledger, Capgemini and more.</p><p> This may well be the blockchain platform that could work for banks and their payment networks, such as Visa and SWIFT, but it also has challenges. In a Reddit stream it is claimed that the BigchainDB structure is fundamentally flawed because all of the network&rsquo;s nodes, by design, connect to a single RethinkDB cluster. RethinkDB is an open-source, scalable database that makes building real-time apps dramatically easier.  The issue is that if something bad happens to that database cluster behind BigchainDB, then the whole blockchain goes down.</p><p> Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange and remittance network based upon the Ripple Labs version of blockchain.  I&rsquo;ve interviewed their CEO Chris Larsen for the  ValueWeb  book &ndash; you can read that interview in full for more background &ndash; but the key paragraphs explaining what they&rsquo;re up to include:</p><p> &ldquo;Ripple was borne out of Bitcoin&rsquo;s incredible revolution. Bitcoin solved the double spend problem, creating, for the first time in history, a digital asset and decentralized ledger with no central operator. This breakthrough means people can send this new currency (bitcoins) to anyone else in the world in minutes and at no cost, instead of days and at the high expense in today&rsquo;s traditional systems.</p><p> &ldquo;Ripple is optimized to serve as improved, IP-based infrastructure for today&rsquo;s payment systems. Amongst distributed payments technologies, Ripple uniquely works with any currency (dollars, euros, yen, etc.), and it settles transactions, including cross-currency transactions, in five seconds.</p><p> &ldquo;So, whereas bitcoin depends on consumers and merchants adopting the currency and exclusively using the blockchain for payments, Ripple is meant for financial institutions to integrate into their core systems to dramatically increase the speed and lower the cost of payments. Financial institutions and networks using Ripple never have to touch digital currency; they continue to deal in the fiat currencies they deal in today.&rdquo;</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Royal Bank of Canada, which is leveraging the technology for remittances, whilst Standard Chartered and DBS have begun using Ripple&rsquo;s tech for trade finance applications. Santander recently launched an app for international payments using Ripple Labs&rsquo; blockchain technology, and more announcements are on the way.  So this is a credible attempt to build something but still has questions, as you will see at the end of this blog update.</p><p> Finally, we have R3 Corda. Corda takes all the great things that the bitcoin blockchain offers, and then removed all the bits that would not work in the banking community.  For example:</p><li> Corda has no unnecessary global sharing of data: only those parties with a legitimate need to know can see the data within an agreement</li><li> Corda achieves consensus between firms at the level of individual deals, not the level of the system</li><li> Corda&rsquo;s design directly enables regulatory and supervisory observer nodes</li><li> Corda transactions are validated by parties to the transaction rather than a broader pool of unrelated validators</li><li> Corda supports a variety of consensus mechanisms</li><li> Corda records an explicit link between human-language legal prose documents and smart contract code</li><li> Corda is built on industry-standard tools</li><li> Corda has no native cryptocurrency</li><p> Launched in April 2016, Corda is in early days developments but the firm make a comment about the key difference between this and bitcoin and Ethereum:</p><p> &ldquo;The applications institutional customers want to use blockchains for are far more complex than anything done on top of Ethereum/Bitcoin so far, and so when we started designing Corda I knew we&rsquo;d need to find ways to radically improve developer productivity &hellip; if making a simple app for Corda took as much work as making a simple app for Bitcoin does, we&rsquo;d have a serious problem.&rdquo; Mike Hearn, R3&rsquo;s lead program engineer and former Bitcoin Core developer</p><p> OK, that makes sense &hellip; or does it.  During my thinking about all of these developments &ndash; Ethereum, BigchainDB, Ripple and R3 &ndash; I kept coming back to an interview with Andreas Antonopoulos, the leading Bitcoin luminary and author of the book  Mastering Bitcoin  and co-founder of the Blockchain Futures Lab.</p><p> In a 50 minute chat with journalist Mark Frauenfelder, there&rsquo;s a sequence at the start that captures the essence of why some of our discussions may be on the wrong track:</p><p> <strong>  Mark Frauenfelder: How are enterprise/private blockchains different from bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Andreas Antonopoulos: </strong>  First of all, I think we&rsquo;ve seen this before. It&rsquo;s very similar to the earlier stages of the consumer Internet, when the Internet was breaking out of the educational environment after the 1993 National Science Foundation decision to open it up to commercial use. At the time, you had people doing things like writing manifestos for the Internet &mdash; John Perry Barlow writing &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace </a> .&rdquo;</p><p> The corporations were really excited about this technology. They could see this was going to be disruptive and they certainly wanted to at least defensively prepare themselves for it. The same narrative is playing out with bitcoin.</p><p> What they did then was try to create other networks with TCP/IP or intranets or various things like MSN and Compuserve &mdash; closed, curated wall ed garden versions of the Internet, where everything would be tame and PG-13 and have all the promise of the Internet, with none of the smut. None of the offensive anything, just a clean Disneyfied version of it.</p><p> Of course, those places failed because they were boring and because the real premise of the Internet wasn&rsquo;t TCP/IP, it wasn&rsquo;t interconnectivity. It was openness, it was permissionless innovation, it was content creators being individuals rather than top down. It was peer-to-peer. All of those things exploded with innovation until eventually everything else just seemed too boring and became obsolete.</p><p> The same thing is happening now with bitcoin. Bitcoin is finance without borders, finance without identity, finance for everyone, finance without banks and governments, finance without authority, without central points of control, etc. We basically present bitcoin to the world as open, decentralized, permissionless innovation, peer-to-peer finance without borders.  The banks and the corporations say, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s awesome. We want that. Only without the open, decentralized, peer-to-peer, borderless, permissionless part. Could we instead have a closed, controlled, tame, identity-laden permission version of that please?&rdquo;</p><p> We promoted the blockchain as, &ldquo;Hey, listen. It&rsquo;s not just about bitcoin.&rdquo; This was two years ago. A lot of people who are in bitcoins started saying, &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s not about bitcoin alone.&rdquo; You have to understand because people thought bitcoin was currency. The argument was it&rsquo;s not about the currency. It&rsquo;s about this trust network as a platform, as a global platform and what it can do.</p><p> We started saying, &ldquo;Pay attention to the blockchain, not just bitcoin.&rdquo; The banks took this all the way to the end and now they&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;blockchain  without  bitcoin.&rdquo; Through 2015 you had this fad transformation where it became very cool and popular to say, &ldquo;You know, after all, it&rsquo;s not about bitcoin. It&rsquo;s about the blockchain instead of bitcoin.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Bitcoin is going to fail but blockchain is going to change the world.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s like the great whitewashing. It&rsquo;s hilarious to watch because, for one thing, it exposes their fundamental misunderstanding of what this is, where the value is, and how it works.</p><p> <strong>  Will enterprise blockchains be successful? </strong></p><p> They&rsquo;re going to be successful in replacing even more insidious forms of centralization like centralized clearinghouses, like Swift, Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, and other quasi-private, monopoly companies that control and clear equities and bonds and commodities.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> They&rsquo;re going to revolutionize Wall Street trading floors. Revolutionize, meaning they&rsquo;ll drag it out of the 70s and maybe bring it in into the late 90s. That may be exciting to bankers. It gives me a major yawn.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s start with the technical. The really cool thing is the open, decentralized blockchain, that is, a blockchain that has no central authority and is open for anyone to participate without asking permission because the trust mechanism doesn&rsquo;t depend on access control like everything that came before. It depends on proof-of-work consensus, which is a decentralized approach to achieving consensus and trust over the state of the system.</p><p> You can only have that if you have a consensus algorithm that is decentralized and anonymous, such as proof-of-work mining and bitcoin. We haven&rsquo;t found another good enough one yet. That only works if you have a reward associated with mining to create this game-theoretical competition and balance between the incentives for private profit and trust in the system. We know that works. It works very well and it&rsquo;s scaled so far to double-digit billion dollars, which had never happened before and that in itself is astonishing.</p><p> The idea that you can make a blockchain without bitcoin or without a currency &mdash; you can really, but the only way to do that is to replace the decentralized consensus mechanism with a committee, which is what they call &ldquo;signing instead of mining.&rdquo; You get ten banks together and, instead of mining blocks competitively in an open way, they sign the blocks, they take turns.</p><p> There&rsquo;s an algorithm for that called Byzantine Paxos, which is a distributed consensus algorithm. It&rsquo;s basically what we used to call three-phase commit. It&rsquo;s like a round-robin signing party where you elect a leader each round and they sign for all of the transactions. As long as you trust that nine banks are better than one central clearinghouse and won&rsquo;t cheat as much, then okay.</p><p> But that system is not immutable. The banks can get together and roll back the blockchain and write something else. With bitcoin&rsquo;s proof-of-work, you can&rsquo;t do that. No one can do that because you can&rsquo;t get enough miners to put enormous amounts of hashing power behind that kind of effort. You lose immutability. You lose decentralization.</p><p> Because the model is based on this round-robin of trusted partners, you lose the permissionless open access so it becomes something where you have to have permission to join and almost certainly isn&rsquo;t open in public. It will almost certainly have to have ID added back into it, which brings all of the disadvantages of identity theft if you&rsquo;re a consumer and will give us an absolute treasure trove if you&rsquo;re Wikileaks. Imagine what happens when Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s blockchain leaks. You&rsquo;re going to have a time stamp for every financial transaction they&rsquo;ve ever done. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p><p> They&rsquo;re adding identity back to this, which is absolutely idiotic. You  can  have a blockchain without the currency. You just can&rsquo;t have an open, decentralized blockchain where the trust lies in this game-theoretical competition that is neutral and based on rules. Instead, you have to put trust in third parties, counterparties who are the signers.</p><p> That then becomes business as usual, which may be revolutionary for banks. But, immediately it cannot be borderless because in order to maintain control over a system like that, you have to control identity. That means you have the old Bank Secrecy Act, Know Your Customer rules, and Anti-Money Laundering rules which, in themselves, are responsible for this problem of global economic exclusion, the reason people can&rsquo;t participate in the banking system. So you re-erect the borders.</p><p> Essentially what it is, is an intranet and an intranet is boring. It&rsquo;s stale content. It&rsquo;s the less secure version of everything out there. You can&rsquo;t run the apps you want because corporate IT didn&rsquo;t allow them. It&rsquo;s stagnant innovation. In the end, it also lags behind in terms of security because it&rsquo;s not exposed to the kind of robust peer review that an open Internet-based system has to have to survive. While bitcoin is getting stronger and stronger with security, these things will actually wither.</p><p> I did a presentation called Bubble Boy and the Sewer Rat, about that very topic.</p><p> The idea being that intranets end up being these really insecure places where you&rsquo;re running Outlook and FrontPage and old versions of Apache that haven&rsquo;t been patched. Whereas on the Internet, if you&rsquo;re Facebook, if you&rsquo;re Google, if you&rsquo;re Apple and you&rsquo;re operating Internet applications, you have to be robust. You have to respond to vulnerability. You have to make systems that are antifragile, resilient to attack and they&rsquo;re constantly evolving and they&rsquo;ve become very robust.</p><p> Whereas, the things that you put in a bubble are like Bubble Boy. If you remember from the 70s, a kid who lived in a bubble because he had no immune system is like raising a child in a bath of Purell. You&rsquo;re going to turn them into an allergic weakling.</p><p> In meantime, bitcoin isn&rsquo;t living in a bubble. Bitcoin is a sewer rat. It&rsquo;s missing a leg. Its snout was badly mangled in an accident in last year. It&rsquo;s not allergic to anything. In fact, it&rsquo;s probably got a couple of strains of bubonic plague on it which it treats like a common cold. You have a system that is antifragile and dynamic and robust.</p><p> This is the big argument of 2015. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take bitcoin, cut off its beard, take away its piercings, put it in a suit, call it blockchain, and present it to the board.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s safe. It&rsquo;s got borders. We can apply the same regulations. We can put barriers to entry and create anti-competitive environment to control who has access. It will be more efficient than our existing banking system.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> If what they want to do is the Outlook of currencies, go ahead, by all means. That&rsquo;s what intranets turned into. It&rsquo;s stale wiki content hosted on FrontPage and Outlook. People hate that. Eventually, successful, vibrant, innovative companies are the ones that turn their IT infrastructure inside out. In the future of finance, successful, vibrant, and innovative banks are the ones that turn their infrastructure inside out and make it part of an open, borderless financial system that serves the other 6 billion, that serves all the people who have been excluded from finance.</p><p> Because here is the thing: we&rsquo;ve had the Internet now for 25 years. If you look at the statistics, financial inclusion is getting worse. That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense unless you consider that, in the meantime, the traditional currencies and digital finance systems have been getting more and more prone to surveillance and tied to identity where everything is tracked. They&rsquo;re closing in on themselves in order to maintain this ironclad control over who sends money to who, all in the name of terrorist prevention and anti-money laundering, which is bullshit because HSBC could money-launder billions. Always have since their birth in the Opium Wars and nobody ever goes to jail. God forbid, a kid buys a joint with bitcoin and everybody&rsquo;s up in arms.</p><p> What is this doing in the meantime? The real question is how many billions of people are you going to sacrifice on the altar of money laundering, because the current answer is just a bit over four billion people. Four billion people who are in the deepest parts of poverty are excluded from banking and financial systems and it is because of Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering and borders and control of networks.</p><p> You cannot create global finance and economic inclusion on the back of a carefully controlled show-us-your-papers identity-based system where everything is tracked. What you create is a global surveillance dystopia. Our entire financial system is heading into this thing where everything is surveilled. Bitcoin is heading in exact opposite direction. No identity by default, from weak pseudonymity to a stronger and stronger anonymity as time goes by.</p><p> As a result, it doesn&rsquo;t do borders. It doesn&rsquo;t care about borders. It doesn&rsquo;t do Know Your Customer. It doesn&rsquo;t do Anti-Money Laundering. It doesn&rsquo;t do those things because those things are bourgeois concepts of the privileged financial elite. Those bourgeois concepts have a four-billion-people-in-poverty price tag.</p><p> <strong>  Are banks and financial institutions trying to centralize the blockchain? </strong></p><p> Absolutely. It&rsquo;s not so much centralize the blockchain. It&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re starting with a premise that finance must be controlled in order to be secure. In order to be controlled and secure, it has to have identity. In order to have identity, you have to control all the endpoints and it has to be a closed system. In order for it to be a closed system, you have to control access and centralize everything as much as possible.</p><p> You want end-to-end control. You can&rsquo;t have leaks because leaks are the places where money laundering happens (money laundering for brown people, not money laundering for rich white people. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t care about that,&rdquo; [say the powers that be]). The end result is that they&rsquo;re making the system more and more centralized in this desperate attempt to fulfill a dream that started in the 70s that you could create this perfect Disneyfied world economy where everybody&rsquo;s finances are known.</p><p> When they talk about Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering rules, they assume the information all flows in one direction &mdash; to them. They don&rsquo;t assume that the CIA&rsquo;s money laundering for weapons purchases are seen by the Chinese. They assume what that means is that the Syrian dissidents&rsquo; money is known by the CIA. It&rsquo;s only one-way flow.</p><p> Anyway, not to get too political, but the point is that money has been heading away from cash and towards digital and, with that, digital came an attempt to turn it all into a giant mainframe, highly centralized. But the problem is that within the centralized systems, of course, corruptible centralization of power corrupts absolutely. It creates fragility, and so in this march to centralization for reasons of control, which is taken for granted among these circles, the end results have been fragile markets, fragile economies, fragile currencies, and increasingly, corruption.</p><p> The companies that have control of a clearing of equities front-run the transactions of their friends and delay the transactions of the ones they&rsquo;re competing with. You have all of these rigged markets where privileged access is the name of the game.</p><p> What the banks want is they want it a hell of a lot more centralized and controlled than bitcoins and they certainly don&rsquo;t want this ragtag army of misfits to suddenly create competition where they had this nicely parceled-up monopolistic market. But they don&rsquo;t want it as controlled as the one clearinghouse. For them, a blockchain is this great liberalization. It&rsquo;s decentralizing their clearinghouses. That&rsquo;s because their definition of the scale of centralization is very narrow.</p><p> You can read and listen to the full interview with Andreas  <a href=\"https://medium.com/institute-for-the-future/bitcoin-is-the-sewer-rat-of-currencies-b89819cdf036#.3dwy719oh\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  over here </a> , and I think that what this demonstrates all-in-all is the very nascent nature of blockchain technology.  There are so many blockchains out there, and the challenge is which one to focus upon and which one will win.  Or does one win at all, as many are saying there will be multiple blockchains and interoperability and standards will be the key.  As can be seen it is still early days but, for those who get on board early, the rewards will be immense.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 14:56:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 14:56:41.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_691i6CM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-blockchain-is-like-the-internet-before-the-browser/\", \"post_id\": \"12718\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 14:56:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 14:56:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-blockchain-is-like-the-internet-before-the-browser\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12717\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6178\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-blockchain-internet-browser.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"888\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469523600,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

Don't Make These Avoidable Errors","link":"planning-a-big-work-event-dont-make-these-avoidable-errors","source_link":null,"content":"<p> So much time and effort go into planning events that it&rsquo;s an absolute pity to be a witness to easily avoidable errors. Events are a type of sale because every planner wants to develop a loyal clientele.</p><p> Attention to detail from the client perspective earns a returning and referring clientele.</p><h3> My Story <br/>  </h3><p> Being in attendance at two different events re-emphasized the importance of attention to detail. The best strategy is when all details are presented from the intended clients&rsquo; perspective.</p><h3> Example 1 <br/>  </h3><p> Difficulty arose at the first event whereby registrants did not receive the promised package upfront. The worst part was that the emailed link regarding the event did not work. Compounding the errors, the registrants were sent marketing information about similar events before the first one ever took place. The practice annoyed everyone. And at the end of the day, expectations were not met.</p><h3> Example 2 <br/>  </h3><p> An event was promoted as informing the attendees about new development in the county. Expectations included learning about new industries entering the county, building plans, and possible investment opportunities. Only a small part of the promoted program proved to be true. A short time was spent on new industry arriving. But then a yoga instructor and an essential oil representative both spoke. Attendees left somewhat disgruntled.</p><p> In both examples, the likelihood of a returning clientele is highly unlikely.</p><h3> Your Story <br/>  </h3><p> Whether you are planning an event, a meeting or preparing for a job interview, the following suggestions apply. Review these to be certain nothing is overlooked.</p><h3> Planning Ahead <br/>  </h3><p> Most people, even in the professional sales arena, will &ldquo;fly by the seat of their pants&rdquo;. In other words, little planning goes into effect. Once meetings are arranged or registrants confirmed, do research on the people involved and companies they may represent. LinkedIn is the perfect site to get started. Should you have more time, check out their tweets or postings on Facebook to gain better insight into their personalities.</p><p> By the time you do meet, you have a solid footing for establishing sound relationships. This is what contributes dearly to an appreciative clientele.</p><h3> Outlining the Agenda and Expectations <br/>  </h3><p> Every type of meeting should include an agenda. Declare your intent and ask for your client&rsquo;s intent for the outcome of the meeting. Double check afterward that expectations were met and possibly exceeded. Should this not be the case, find out why. Resolve to improve for the future.</p><h3> Consistency <br/>  </h3><p> Whether you are hiring speakers or simply representing yourself, consistency in all you do is what builds a notable personal brand. People quickly recognize they may count on you to deliver as promised.</p><h3> Marketing Tips <br/>  </h3><p> My view is that it is very bad form to begin marketing new events prior to the current one being completed. The message that comes across is the old-fashioned &ldquo;buy-buy-buy&rdquo;. It is annoying and will dissuade future sales.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> After the Event <br/>  </h3><p> Provide feedback forms at events. Anything that looks negative, follow up with a phone call for a personal conversation. This will soothe irritation and may lend light on how to improve future events. Additionally, the fact that you show concern for the person not quite satisfied may change their opinion to become a loyal client.</p><h3> Relationship Development <br/>  </h3><p> Sales and account management are dependent upon continual effort to build relationships. When others see that you care about them, they will reciprocate in caring about your service. Over time, their patronage will develop into the Smooth Sale!</p><h3> Sales Tips <br/>  </h3><li> Review all practices for meetings and events</li><li> Strategize where improvement may be made</li><li> Recall negative commentary for further improvement</li><li> Check in with registrants prior to events asking for questions</li><li> Answer all questions in full</li><li> Deliver reasonable expectations for events and meetings</li><li> Double check as to why people agree to attend events or meetings (interviews, too)</li><li> Check afterwards that satisfaction and expectations were met</li><li> Ask for ideas concerning future events</li><li> Thank people for their time and attendance</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 14:58:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 14:58:44.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_6zagIlW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/planning-a-big-work-event-dont-make-these-avoidable-errors/\", \"post_id\": \"12720\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 14:58:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 14:58:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"planning-a-big-work-event-dont-make-these-avoidable-errors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12719\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6179\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/planning-big-work-event-dont-make-these-avoidable-errors.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"555\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469545200,"author_id":161,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5931,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Financial Failings of NBA Star","link":"the-financial-failings-of-nba-star","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Former NBA All-Star forward Antoine Walker possessed a varied skill-set that enabled him to play both inside and outside. A big man who also shot the three, Walker was notorious for his hilariously erratic shot selection and, later in his career, an aversion to running that led to lazy play.The quality of financial advice Walker received throughout his career was evidently very close to the quality of his shot attempts, as he  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/24/investing/antoine-walker-nba-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\">  filed for bankruptcy </a>  in 2010, two years after he retired from the game. In a recent column in the  <a href=\"http://www.theplayerstribune.com/2016-6-28-antoine-walker-nba-letter-to-my-younger-self/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Players&rsquo; Tribune </a> , Walker writes a letter to his younger self detailing what went wrong and what he could have done better.Surprisingly, there are a few money management lessons that anyone&mdash;NBA star or not&mdash;can apply.</p><h3> Actively Screen Advisors</h3>Screen advisors before you hire them, and after you do, make sure you know where your money is going. Walker frames his letter with the importance and difficulty of saying &ldquo;no,&rdquo; whether to friends asking for money or, most crucially, a friend of a friend who asked for money to start a real estate venture.The advisor, who Walker met at a dinner with NBA colleagues, started Walker Ventures with bank loans guaranteed by Walker&rsquo;s personal portfolio, an incredibly risky move. Walker let the advisor have complete control of managing the properties since he was playing basketball nine months of the year. Ultimately, Walker Ventures was forced to close after the housing crash with $20 million of debt. The advisor went to jail, and Walker was forced to file for bankruptcy.There were a couple ways this could have been prevented. First, Walker didn&rsquo;t do much due diligence before making the deal. He could have run it by another advisor, who probably would have told him it was structured as an extremely risky venture. Second, because of his schedule, Walker did not adequately check up on the investments.Many people, particularly young investors, share Walker&rsquo;s desire to make some money outside of their main job, especially to save for retirement. Finding a financial advisor who is trustworthy, and right for your unique needs, is very important. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor.</a>)##TRENDING##<h3> The Upside of Having Someone Say No</h3>Walker&rsquo;s trouble with the real estate venture was compounded by his reckless spending. While he confesses that he spent lavishly on himself, including a $350,000 Maybach car, it appears that what took the biggest bite out of Walker&rsquo;s wallet was his spending on family and friends. &ldquo;I gave them whatever they wanted and spoiled them. You can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Walker said in a CNN/Money interview. &ldquo;It ended up being an open ATM throughout my career.&rdquo;While most of us don&rsquo;t take our friends to a Gucci store and let them buy whatever they want&mdash;as Walker has said he did&mdash;spending without at least an idea of what is manageable is a problem many people encounter. For <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> young professionals in particular</a>, overspending can seriously hinder retirement saving.A good financial advisor will do more than simply invest your money. They will incorporate periodic spending goals, major expenditures like vacations, and life events like a new home or wedding into your comprehensive financial plan. Sometimes, this could mean advising against a big purchase for the sake of a long-term goal.Obviously, we don&rsquo;t all have $110 million to blow like Antoine Walker. But lackadaisical spending control and being too busy to check on our investments or advisors are traps anyone could fall into. Ensuring that your money is in the right hands is a universally important objective.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 14:58:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 14:58:44.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_czITCUZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-financial-failings-of-nba-star/\", \"post_id\": \"12721\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 14:58:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 14:58:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-financial-failings-of-nba-star\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12722\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6180\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/financial-failings-nba-star.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"667\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469548800,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5932,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Swap Skepticism for Optimism! 7 Ways To Lead With Fresh Eyes","link":"swap-skepticism-for-optimism-7-ways-to-lead-with-fresh-eyes","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I just returned from a wonderful vacation in the northwest of the U.S. and Canada. That part of the world possesses incredible natural beauty and laid-back charm.</p><p> Very different from the hustle and bustle of the northeast U.S. where I spend most of my professional and personal life. Many leaders know intuitively that they get refreshed when they take breaks but another really exciting phenomenon takes place when we step away from our routines.</p><p> We are able to view and think about our work worlds from a new perspective. We are able to view our typical workload through a new lens. We become empowered to lead with fresh eyes.</p><h3> Here are seven ways to lead with fresh eyes: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. APPROACH THE NEXT PROJECT AS IF IT WAS THE FIRST <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s nothing more special than a new beginning and tackling something for the first time. It&rsquo;s invigorating and opens us up. Think back to when you did one of your routine assignments for the first time. Can you remember what that felt like? I can remember the excitement of presenting one of my first trainings and the thrill of knowing I could make a difference in someone&rsquo;s professional life. Of course, I also had some trepidation, but my adrenalin was pumping.</p><h3> 2. BRAINSTORM NEW POSSIBILITIES <br/>  </h3><p> A great way to lead with fresh eyes is to allow our minds a brainstorming session. Instead of going through the same motions to complete a deliverable, change it up. Identify several different strategies that you haven&rsquo;t used before. Trust your gut and give it a whirl. Even if it takes longer, the energy we bring to brainstorming will often produce innovation we never thought.</p><h3> 3. CONDUCT NEW RESEARCH <br/>  </h3><p> Fresh eyes allow leaders to go back to the drawing board and pursue new research. We empower ourselves with questions:</p><li> What new studies have come out about this topic?</li><li> Is there a new book or author that may shed light on my project?</li><li> Should I set up a lunch with someone on my team or someone in the company who may have helpful insights?</li><h3> 4. COMMIT TO TAKING NEW RISKS <br/>  </h3><p> When we give ourselves permission to see our facts and experiences through a different lens, we are likely to take a leap. During one of my workshops one leader decided to review the new firm values and see how they might impact the direction he was guiding his team. He realized that there might be new technology that might support the organization&rsquo;s new path that involved working across departments. He set out to form inter-department monthly meetings. Think about a risk you have wanted to take and clear away the roadblocks.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 5. SWAP SKEPTICISM FOR OPTIMISM <br/>  </h3><p> There is a place and time for not jumping into new waters without a healthy dose of evaluation. Yet, there is also a time for remaining open-minded and optimistic. When we lead with fresh eyes we tend to focus on the things that may work instead of dwelling on the broken parts. One of my clients was zeroing in on how poorly prepared her new supervisors were to lead their teams, while she needed to also see what value they each brought. She wasn&rsquo;t in as rough shape as she initially thought.</p><h3> 6. ALLOW YOUR HEART OUT <br/>  </h3><p> Fresh eyes are respectful of feelings and beliefs.</p><li> Ask team members how things are going</li><li> Be respectful of different backgrounds and cultures</li><li> Show compassion for challenges people are facing by helping them out and strategizing</li><li> Be a leader with heart</li><h3> 7.

Cruising these exquisite passages, your own private yacht delivers you to iconic destinations around the Cycladic and Dodecanese Islands, tracing history, art, and culture in luxurious comfort.</p><p> Majestically moving from one iconic spot to the next aboard your private yacht, you will feel the magic of the ages as you experience the Greek Islands on board the perfect yacht for your needs. This itinerary only covers a week&rsquo;s worth of what could easily prove a lifetime of exploration of Greece&rsquo;s 2,000 islands.</p><h3> <strong>  DAY ONE: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Athens deserves your attention, but so does the sea and it&rsquo;s many island jewels. Take a peek around Athens, by all means, but board your yacht and prepare for the trip of a lifetime.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1_2.jpg\" width=\"894\"/></p><h3> <strong>  DAY TWO: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Tucked into a luscious bay on the Saranic Gulf, the idyllic town of Spetses quietly waits for those who seek solace. Often compared to the Hamptons, or even Monaco, the enclave is only accessible by boat. Spetses has no private cars, nor tourism to speak of, but is home to mansion after mansion, building a skyline that reflects the wealth of the island. After a simple cruising day, check out the Poiseidonian Grand for a memorable meal, or T&ocirc;le for cocktails and dancing.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"609\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2_0.jpg\" width=\"894\"/></p><h3> <strong>  DAY THREE: </strong></h3><p> <br/> The island of Milos offers incredible diving, with many sites accommodating all levels of experience. On shore, there are Christian catacombs, and a very old Minoan city, Filakopi, which flourished from 3300 to 1100 B.C. Beaches all around the island are stunning, but Sarakiniko&rsquo;s massive white monoliths and white sand contrast nicely with the deep blue of the sea. Agathia is great for peace and tranquility, and Adamas for lively tavernas along the coastline.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/3_0.jpg\" width=\"893\"/></p><h3> <strong>  DAY FOUR: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Santorini, also known as Thira, blends history, tourism, and landscape well, serving as one of the most popular destinations throughout the Cyclades. Dramatic 300m cliffs, a clifftop caldera, the 1700 B.C. Minoan city of Akrotiri, and an incredibly beautiful skyline against the stunning turqouise water make Santorini a visual, as well as a cultural, delight. Fabulous sunsets are common, so insure you&rsquo;re either cruising to your advantage, or climbing up to the castle at Oia.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"717\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/4_0.jpg\" width=\"893\"/></p><h3> <strong>  DAY FIVE: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Mykonos and its epic beaches beckon, as you navigate some of the most beautiful waters imaginable. Fabulous for so many reasons, you&rsquo;ll want to see the famous windmills, the Paraportiani Church, and Paradise Beach. Of utmost importance is the pleasure you will get from edging around this luxurious setting in a yacht outfitted to reflect your every wish and whim. If an onshore dinner sounds appealing, consider reservations at Kiki&rsquo;s or Phos, knowing that intriguing, high end pop up dining is in vogue as well, which means asking around upon arrival. Shopping on this island is epic.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"714\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5_0.jpg\" width=\"894\"/></p><h3> <strong>  DAY SIX: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Delos stretches its roots back to the third millennium B.C., showing off a wealth of ruins from several eras of civilization. The birthplace of Apollo in Greek mythology, the island remains a Pan-Hellenic sanctuary. Tremendously important for its history, the island still boasts that no mortal will be born or will die on Delos, continuing the sacred traditions from the Archaic, through the Classic, and Hellenistic eras.</p><h3> <strong>  DAY SEVEN: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Return to Athens, enjoying the idyllic route through beautiful water dotted with rugged islands.</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 15:18:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 15:18:41.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_aGvHCwZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/experience-the-greek-islands-aboard-your-charter-yacht/\", \"post_id\": \"12731\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 15:18:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 15:18:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"experience-the-greek-islands-aboard-your-charter-yacht\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12725\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6182\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/experience-greek-islands-aboard-your-charter-yacht.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1161\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469559600,"author_id":454,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5934,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Innovation in Advice: Challenge All the Basic Assumptions","link":"innovation-in-advice-challenge-all-the-basic-assumptions","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;Innovation&rdquo; and &ldquo;delivering advice&rdquo; do not usually go together do they?</h3><p> <br/> The way advice is delivered by tens of thousands of professionals tends to gravitate to the same methodology.  There is safety hiding in the herd, right?</p><p> The type of advice delivered by tens of thousands of professionals tends to gravitate to the same ideas, products and theories&hellip;.most people ARE influenced by what most other people are doing, and want to do the same after all.</p><h3> But why does it have to be this way?</h3><p> <br/> And how can an adviser truly stand out as being different to the mainstream?  Or stand out within a particular niche of the market?</p><p> To answer the &ldquo;why&rdquo; question; in part it is because well meaning regulators and professional standards developers come up with &ldquo;standards&rdquo; that define how and what &ldquo;good&rdquo; advice should look like.  That becomes THE PROCESS which must be adopted, and in a very short time the entire industry is wondering why financial advice is seen by consumers as being a bland &ldquo;meh&rdquo;thing.</p><p> Funny that.  Advice IS a bland thing usually.  It is about creating safety for consumers more than anything else.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take Modern Portfolio Theory mixed in with a bit of Dollar Cost Averaging via Mutual Funds as a quick example (and I know I&rsquo;ll get sent to hell for saying this).  I have dealt personally with thousands of consumers and probably well more than a thousand advisers during my career, so while my observation is empirical perhaps I do believe I am working with a decent sample size here.</p><h3> I haven&rsquo;t met anyone who became fabulously wealthy by drip-feeding a proportion of their pay packet into a managed fund and spreading their risks.  Not one person.</h3><p> <br/> Sure, there are plenty who have built up a good sized portfolio or estate and are comfortable &ndash; but that is a different thing to being truly independent isn&rsquo;t it? However, I do know or have met quite a few fabulously wealthy people over the same time and have observed that they typically have not subscribed to the dollar cost averaging idea, or using managed funds, or even the whole MPT thing. They became fabulously wealthy and truly independent by concentrating their risks.  By focussing relentlessly on rental property investment for example, or building a business, or becoming superb equities investors&hellip;.the examples are endless, but the common thread is the same:  They did something different to the conventional thinking.  As a result, they built extraordinary lives for themselves.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> I have observed the same pattern with advice businesses &ndash; and been absolutely guilty of it myself.  </p><p> We find out what the rules of the game are (best practice standards, plus the rules and regulations applying to us), and look at how the industry is comfortable with generating revenue (what is the &ldquo;norm&rdquo;), and then try to find the consumers who like safety and hiding in the herd and turn them into clients.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> So the standard business formula for an advisory firm looks like: <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"291\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/obey-rules.png\" width=\"688\"/></p><h3> A couple of observations before I go further though: <br/>  </h3><li> the above model will be a workable business that can satisfy a large number of consumers</li><li> it works for shareholders and stakeholders of the advisory firm</li><li> it is safe &ndash; relatively speaking <br/>  </li><p> So it has its merits, and is a viable method of building an advice business which can profitably meet the needs of its constituents.</p><p> But not every adviser wants their career defined that way.</p><p> Not every consumer wants bland and safe.</p><p> The most interesting, challenging, demanding, lucrative and valuable clients an advice firm could have do not gravitate to this model.</p><p> To begin figuring out how to innovate in delivering financial advice as a commercial service we do have to ask the basic question:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Why does it have to be this way?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> There are often reasons &ndash; such as regulations &ndash; that prescribe a certain thing must happen in a certain way.  For instance; we have a rule which says advice must be delivered in writing, so delivering advice in a written format is &ldquo;must&rdquo;.</p><p> But to innovate we need to move beyond what is a &ldquo;must&rdquo; and figure out</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;How would it work ideally?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> We might then come up with an answer such as &ldquo; for our target market clients advice needs to be captured basically as a podcast &ldquo;.  Delivering advice digitally, and orally, yet still in a recorded format which can be provided as evidence of suitability later might be the answer that most aligns the consumers expectation with our competency and todays technology and communications methods.</p><p> In order to be &ldquo;compliant&rdquo; we might then back that up with a written transcript which is delivered electronically to the client &ndash; knowing and expecting that nobody but an auditor or regulator is ever going to look at that written transcript in time to come.</p><h3> The &ldquo;secret&rdquo; to innovating as an advice firm is to understand three things, and then figure out how they overlap or intersect. The three things to understand which unlock innovative thinking are: <br/>  </h3><li> What is desirable?</li><li> What is do-able?</li><li> What is profitable? <br/>  </li><p> The first is about focussing upon the end-user &ndash; the client. What is it they want?  How do they want things to work?  What do they value?  What wows them? What are their expectations? Basically&hellip;..what do they desire?</p><p> The second is more technical, or pragmatic, in focus. What is physically possible? Does the technology exist, or how can it be used?  How could we use knowledge or technology if we were not restricted in how we married them up?  How could we do faster, better, leaner, more personalised, more fun, more useful, more timely&hellip;.more anything&hellip;.what is actually feasible in todays world with what we know and what we have or can access?</p><p> The final question is the limiting one: can the fabulous concepts be done profitably? You might have a great and empowering idea that would attract every billionaire on the planet as a client of your firm&hellip;such as they get Warren Buffett personally managing their money and talking to them personally each week.  But can you afford him? And still make a dollar for your own stakeholders?  Or maybe you should just hologram yourself into a meeting virtually&hellip;..or hey! maybe we should hologram Warren Buffett in?</p><p> &hellip;but if that technology cost $3,000,000 to implement and the turnover of your firm is $500,000 per year, then maybe it is not a good innovation after all&hellip;.or maybe it is a good innovation but the cost of the technology is just too steep right now. It is perhaps an idea for the future&hellip;.</p><p> When re-thinking how your business could work, or how it could deliver the type of value that your ideal target market clients want, don&rsquo;t let the final question regarding profitability stifle you.  Good ideas can be good ideas whose time simply has not come yet &ndash; but don&rsquo;t lose the good idea.  The profitability question really serves as a checkpoint on which ideas to run with  now .</p><p> <strong>  To achieve breakthroughs in how a practice works, or perhaps redefine how an entire industry works, requires that we challenge all the basic assumptions to begin with. </strong> It is that challenging of the status quo, asking &ldquo;why does it have to be this way&rdquo;, which leads us into innovative thinking and potentially seeing the business future an entirely different way.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-25 15:27:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-25 15:27:45.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_9eF8Els.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/innovation-in-advice-challenge-all-the-basic-assumptions/\", \"post_id\": \"12734\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-25 15:27:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-25 15:27:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"innovation-in-advice-challenge-all-the-basic-assumptions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12732\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6183\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/innovation-advice-challenge-all-basic-assumptions.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1248\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469520000,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5935,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Revenge of the Nerds (all Thanks to the DOL)","link":"revenge-of-the-nerds-all-thanks-to-the-dol","source_link":null,"content":"<p> An amazing thing just happened in the industry. Regulatory changes aren&rsquo;t always a benefit to advisors (and sometimes they&rsquo;re downright detrimental to business), but the  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20160410/FREE/304109997/a-dol-fiduciary-rule-everyone-can-live-with\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  DOL fiduciary rule </a>  should have every fiduciary-focused advisor jumping for joy.</p><p> At long last, consumers are hearing about the value of a true fiduciary. The hedge fund scandals that rocked the investment world over last decade should have woken them up long before now, but it took April&rsquo;s highly anticipated ruling to bring fiduciary responsibility to the front page. People who may have never even heard the word &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo;&mdash;much less understood what it meant&mdash;are now chatting about it over cocktails. And they&rsquo;re finally getting it.</p><p> Within the financial services industry, this means that, finally, the &ldquo;nerds&rdquo; are getting the spotlight, and these smart, client-focused advisors are poised to reap their just rewards. Rewards for consistency. Rewards for paying close attention not to big-bang returns, but on the true needs of their clients. Rewards for delivering consistent, reliable results year and year after year. Sure, this type of deliverable doesn&rsquo;t sound as sexy as the 20% return on investment that flashy advisor down the street has been promising for years (while he calmly assures his clients that the recent down market is just an anomaly), but it&rsquo;s real. It&rsquo;s tangible. And better yet, it&rsquo;s what your clients actually  need .</p><p> For advisors, it&rsquo;s a shift that has the potential to have a major impact on the growth of your practice. First, you&rsquo;ll no longer be forced to compete with that flashy, non-fiduciary advisor. If the DOL didn&rsquo;t outright close his doors, they&rsquo;ve certainly thrown a wrench in the spokes, and it&rsquo;s going to take some time to adjust to this new, required model. Second, it opens up a valuable opportunity to demonstrate to clients and prospects alike how, as a fiduciary, your process is inherently outcome-oriented. Rather than seeking unrealistic returns, your focus is on growing  and  protecting their assets. Rather than seeking alpha regardless of risk exposure, you focus on building a tailored portfolio based on their specific goals and risk tolerance. And while you can&rsquo;t promise a 20% return, your clients and prospects finally know that  <u>  no one can deliver on that promise </u> . Even more, they never could.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Of course, even as a fiduciary, the DOL rule includes an increase in regulatory, compliance and risk oversight that can feel daunting, and it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of focusing on all the things you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing. Instead, I urge you to consider focusing on the things you can be doing to demonstrate consistency and due diligence in your role as a fiduciary.</p><p> <strong>  1. Deliver the investment experience your clients want&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. </strong></p><p> Having investments perform as expected is paramount to success in today&rsquo;s environment. As a result, proving your expertise as an advisor has little to do with &ldquo;achieving big alpha&rdquo; and everything to do with delivering the results your clients want. What you may find is that few clients actually expect alpha&mdash;or excess returns relative to the return of the benchmark index. In fact, I would argue that there is elegance in achieving zero alpha above the compensated risk your client is seeking. Yet there&rsquo;s always that temptation to outperform.Think about it: your client comes to you seeking a domestic portfolio with no international exposure, so you place her in a fund that&rsquo;s not a pure exposure model and has achieved alpha in the domestic space for five years running. You later learn there actually was some international posture in these products, and that exposure was responsible for the alpha over the domestic benchmark. Is it better to produce alpha (after all, every client loves big numbers!), or better to fulfill your fiduciary responsibility to your client and maintain the exposure she requested?</p><p> No matter how tempting it may be to outperform and be a rock-star advisor, stick to your fiduciary duty and deliver what your clients ask for&mdash;even when the big alpha is out there like a carrot on a stick.</p><p> <strong>  2. Upgrade your client communication&mdash;and your due diligence. </strong></p><p> A huge part of due diligence is client communication. To comply with the new regulations, create a formalized communication plan and execute it consistently. It&rsquo;s one of the simplest things you can do, and it delivers clarity and transparency. To get started, email your clients with three simple questions: How often would you like to hear from me? What method of communication do you prefer? What events or education interest you?The results may surprise you. I counseled one firm whose clients replied that they expected to hear from their advisor weekly&mdash;and even daily during market turbulence.  The advisor was overwhelmed because of this &ldquo;can of worms&rdquo; that had been opened, and it was in writing. In reality, it was fantastic news.

{"original_id":5938,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Looking for Stable Income? Consider US Real Estate","link":"looking-for-stable-income-consider-us-real-estate","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/en/author/Gershon_Distenfeld\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gershon Distenfeld </a> ,  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/en/author/Brian_Phillips\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brian Phillips </a></p><h3> Earning investment income today is tough&mdash;and it&rsquo;s probably going to stay that way. But there are opportunities in less traveled parts of the bond market. And they&rsquo;re not as risky as you might think.</h3><p> <br/> Consider US commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). CMBS package together hundreds of loans for properties such as downtown office buildings, hotels, shopping malls and multifamily apartment complexes.</p><p> Like all securitized assets tied to US real estate, these bonds often get a bad rap. That&rsquo;s understandable&mdash;but not entirely fair.</p><p> During the financial crisis, the plunge in the value of many mortgage-backed bonds was traumatic for investors. Holders of the lower-rated or equity tranches sustained big losses. To be fair, that&rsquo;s the way structured products are supposed to work. The highest-quality tranches enjoy the most credit protection, while the lower ones offer higher yields but are first to absorb losses when underlying loans default.</p><h3> <b>  NOT LAST DECADE&rsquo;S LOANS </b></h3><p> <br/> But the commercial loans originated after the CMBS market hit bottom in 2010 are very different from those that were made between 2006 and 2008. That&rsquo;s because large and regional US banks got stricter and overhauled their lending practices. At the same time, credit enhancement levels for the non-AAA-rated CMBS have approximately doubled, which creates a deeper cushion against loan losses.</p><p> As the display below illustrates, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, which compare the size of the loan to the value of the property, came down sharply between 2010 and 2014. At the same time, property values rose, making the effective LTVs of these loan pools even lower. For instance, the BBB-rated tranche of CMBS issued between 2012 and 2014 offer strong credit fundamentals and yields of up to 7.5%.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"421\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CMBS.png\" width=\"997\"/></p><p> Interestingly, CMBS issued in 2015 and 2016 are less compelling. While the top-rated tranches look fine, the BBB-rated ones don&rsquo;t perform as well under stress scenarios, making them less attractive from a risk/reward point of view. This is mainly because we&rsquo;re in the later stages of the commercial real estate cycle today&mdash;and it underscores the importance of being selective.</p><p> There are other features to US CMBS that we think make them attractive. They include:</p><li> Stable earnings: The bonds are backed by earnings generated by contractual leases, so the cash flow they produce is stable. The longer the lease term, the better. And unlike in the UK and Europe, US leases don&rsquo;t reprice until the term is up. So even if rents decline, the rate at the time of the contract is locked in.</li><li> Static loan pools: In Europe, originators can substitute loans by refinancing the senior or junior slices of the structure. In the US, whatever was included at the start stays there. The loan pools are diversified, both by borrower type and geographically. <br/>  </li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <b>  BUBBLE? WE DON&rsquo;T THINK SO </b></h3><p> <br/> Overall, the US CMBS market is now about 15% above its 2007 precrisis peak. That may sound alarming, but it isn&rsquo;t. US stocks, by comparison, are up 37% from their precrisis peak. The CMBS increase has barely kept pace with inflation.</p><p> And while CMBS prices have rebounded, there has been no accompanying surge in supply. We think that means price declines should remain modest.</p><p> There are pockets of the market that have been overbid, and we think Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has been  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-21/fed-warns-of-vulnerabilities-building-in-commercial-real-estate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  right to point this out </a> . Fortunately, the Fed and other US regulators have taken steps that should introduce even more discipline to the underwriting process.</p><h3> <b>  BETTER REGULATIONS, BETTER UNDERWRITING </b></h3><p> <br/> One of these steps involves using regulatory capital charges to impose discipline on US regional banks. The loans these banks are now writing come with origination LTVs of about 60%. In the past, their lending standards were looser, with LTVs of 65%. This more disciplined lending is important because regional banks&rsquo; share of the commercial real estate market has been increasing.</p><p> Another new rule will require CMBS issuers to retain 5% of every deal for five years. This ensures they have skin in the game because it prohibits them from turning around and selling the riskiest tranches that are first in line to absorb losses. These &ldquo;risk retention&rdquo; requirements were mandated by the Dodd-Frank act and will go into effect in December.</p><p> Could overall valuations dip from here? Sure. Tighter regulations and overall market volatility could contribute to that. But in our view, investors in higher-quality 2012&ndash;2014 CMBS should be reasonably well protected against stress losses.</p><p> Meanwhile, we think that the relatively stable US job market and a still-growing US economy should provide additional support. In fact, a modest market decline may present an attractive buying opportunity for careful investors.</p><p> It&rsquo;s hard enough earning income these days without limiting yourself to just one or two pockets of the bond market. In our view, investors who diversify their portfolios to include promising sectors such as US CMBS give themselves a better chance to boost returns.</p><i> The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams.</i>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-26 13:13:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-26 13:13:52.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_bkGwjGn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/looking-for-stable-income-consider-us-real-estate/\", \"post_id\": \"12743\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-26 13:13:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-26 13:13:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"looking-for-stable-income-consider-us-real-estate\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12741\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6187\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/looking-stable-income-consider-us-real-estate.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"656\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469613600,"author_id":16,"chart_url":""}

This extends muni bonds&rsquo; multi-month-long streak in net inflows&mdash;already one of the longest in U.S. history&mdash;proving that in a world of low government bond yields and macroeconomic uncertainty, munis continue to be sought as a &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; for their relatively low volatility, modest gains and, of course, tax-free income.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/40-straight-weeks-of-muni-bond-fund-inflows.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Even yield-starved foreign investors, who aren&rsquo;t eligible to take advantage of the tax benefits, are seeking shelter in American munis. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, about $10 trillion worth of global government debt now carries historically low or negative yields.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/a-world-of-negative-yields.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> For some investors, the worry now is that the muni tax exemption might soon be capped or eliminated altogether, which would drastically reduce the security&rsquo;s appeal.</p><p> The thing is, I don&rsquo;t see this happening. Here&rsquo;s why.</p><h3> More than 100 Years of Tax-Free Income <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/state-and-loca-government-projects-financed-through-tax-exempt-muni-bonds.png\" width=\"300\"/></p><p> First, a little historical background. Municipal bonds were first written into the tax code a little over 100 years ago, in 1913. Since then, they&rsquo;ve helped finance countless essential public works projects&mdash;everything from schools to hospitals, roads to bridges, airports to seaports, sewers to water treatment plants. More than three quarters of all national infrastructure needs have been built and maintained using muni bonds, which investors have been attracted to for their tax-free income.</p><p> Today, over 57 percent of muni investors are over the age of 65, many of whom live on fixed incomes, according to IRS data.  </p><p> On more than one occasion, President Barack Obama has proposed capping the tax benefit, on the grounds that too much of the $30 billion or so a year in foregone federal taxes ends up in wealthy investors&rsquo; pockets. Indeed, a recent study shows that between 1989 and 2013, municipal bond ownership has increasingly concentrated among the nation&rsquo;s wealthiest households.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Think this is purely part of a socialist agenda? On the contrary, there&rsquo;s been bipartisan support for the idea. Republicans as prominent as former House Speaker John Boehner and Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, have floated capping muni income.</p><p> But with only six months remaining before Obama vacates the White House, a cap is highly unlikely to happen.</p><p> It&rsquo;s equally as unlikely that the next occupant would be in favor of lifting the exemption.</p><h3> Trump and Hillary, United in Infrastructure Spending <br/>  </h3><p> Both presidential nominee Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, who is set to receive the Democratic nomination this week, are strong advocates of infrastructure spending. This might be the only thing the two candidates have in common with each other, as CLSA analyst Christopher Wood pointed out recently in his &ldquo;GREED &amp; fear&rdquo; newsletter. Trump has promised a &ldquo;trillion dollar rebuilding program,&rdquo;while Clinton has proposed a five-year, $275 billion infrastructure restoration package.</p><p> This is certainly good news for our roads, bridges, schools and other public works, many of which are in sore need of a spit shine.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also good for muni investors.</p><p> Ending or reducing the tax benefit is ill-conceived, and I think Trump and Clinton both know that. It would jeopardize hundreds of billions of dollars each year in new debt financing, and would push more construction and labor costs onto local taxpayers.</p><p> So leaving all else aside, I&rsquo;m confident that no matter who wins the election in November, the tax exemption is safe.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-26 14:43:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-26 14:43:39.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/why-donald-trump-or-hillary-clinton-wont-tax-municipal-bonds.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-donald-trump-or-hillary-clinton-wont-tax-municipal-bonds/\", \"post_id\": \"12748\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-26 14:43:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-26 14:43:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-donald-trump-or-hillary-clinton-wont-tax-municipal-bonds\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12744\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6188\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-donald-trump-or-hillary-clinton-wont-tax-municipal-bonds.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"841\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469613600,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5940,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Social Media 101 for Financial Advisors","link":"social-media-101-for-financial-advisors","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Why You Should be Using Social Media</h3><p> In a recent survey of over 800 advisors, researchers found that 81% of advisors are using social media for business. This figure has steadily increased year over year. Nowadays, about 56% of advisors claim that social media plays a significant role in their marketing efforts.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/81-percent-of-advisors.png\" width=\"448\"/></p><p> But it&rsquo;s not just that advisors are using social media, they&rsquo;re also using multiple streams on social media to get the most out of it. About 40% of advisors now use four or more different social networks to grow their business. It makes sense that advisors are putting a larger emphasis on social media, as 50% claim they&rsquo;ve successfully used social media to convert a prospect into a client.</p><p> But beyond converting prospects, social media offers your firm many other benefits including:</p><li> Increased exposure: Your blogs, posts, tweets, and video/photo uploads increase your search engine ranking, meaning more hits for your website.</li><li> Fosters trust: In a profession where trust and communication are key, social media can help you connect with clients. Social networking opens up a new two-way, real-time communication stream which can enhance relationships with clients and prospects alike.</li><li> Additional impact: Social media gives you a public presence beyond your firm&rsquo;s website. This gives you an additional platform where you can promote your services and expertise.</li><li> Establish expertise: Social media gives you somewhere to post original content such as blog posts, articles, and commentary. This allows you to demonstrate your expertise in the field and establish thought leadership.</li><li> Stay in-the-know: Social media sites can help you keep up with professional news and industry trends, connecting you with up-to-the-minute information.</li><li> Connect with other professionals: You can use social media to build a network of other financial professionals. You can then leverage this network to share financial strategies and business ideas and discuss industry trends.</li><h3> The Different Social Media Networks <br/>  </h3><h3> <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/56-percent.png\" width=\"446\"/></h3><p> So you want to get started with social media (or improve what you&rsquo;re already doing), but where to start? There are dozens, if not hundreds, of social media sites out there. But the good news is, there&rsquo;s really only three that you need to worry about.</p><p> The big three include LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. Between these three, you&rsquo;ll be able to reach almost every social media user. But it&rsquo;s important to know, each network is unique and serves a specific purpose for advisors.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> <strong>  LinkedIn: </strong> Used to increase your referral network and connect with other financial professionals. <br/> <strong>  Facebook: </strong> Used to enhance relationships with clients and build your professional brand. <br/> <strong>  Twitter: </strong> Used to establish thought leadership and stay up-to-date on industry news.</p><p> Once you recognize that the aim of each network is a bit unique, it's easier to tailor your content to meet your social media goals.</p><h3> LinkedIn Tips <br/>  </h3><p> LinkedIn is the world&rsquo;s largest online professional networking site. LinkedIn is, by far, the most popular social media site among financial planners, advisors, and other financial professionals. It&rsquo;s primarily used to maintain relationships with colleagues and share knowledge and industry insights. Some pointers to keep in mind while using LinkedIn include:</p><li> Display your certifications: In your LinkedIn profile, there&rsquo;s a dedicated spot to list your professional certifications. Utilize this space! Prospective clients may view your LinkedIn profile, and will want to see your accreditation.</li><li> Keep your profile up-to-date: Make sure to keep your LinkedIn profile up-to-date so colleagues and prospective clients receive relevant information about your certifications and firm.</li><li> Connect with colleagues, business acquaintances, and other professionals you want to maintain a relationship with: LinkedIn is meant for making and maintaining connections, so make good use of this! LinkedIn will use your email contacts to suggest potential connections. Only connect with people you know, but remember that the more connections you have the more potential opportunities you can leverage.</li><li> Join groups: LinkedIn has &ldquo;groups&rdquo; which are smaller networks of individuals with similar interests. There are many groups for financial professionals even groups specifically for advisors! Take advantage of groups by checking out the groups that your connections are a part of.</li><h3> Facebook Tips <br/>  </h3><p> Facebook is a social media site which lets users create a profile and share photos, videos, and messages with their followers. Businesses often utilize Facebook to create a business page which promotes their product/service, increases brand awareness, and allows them to interact directly with customers/clients. Here are some tips to keep in mind when using Facebook:</p><li> Create a business page separate from your personal Facebook account: Facebook allows you to create a fan page for businesses, take advantage of this!</li><li> Upload a profile picture and cover photo consistent with your firm&rsquo;s branding: Make sure to upload your firm&rsquo;s logo to your fan page. And don&rsquo;t use any images that are inconsistent with your firm&rsquo;s overall branding. Consistency is key!</li><li> Share posts/articles by yourself and others than your Facebook audience will find useful: Facebook is all about sharing information. So, make sure to share articles, blog posts, videos, and photos that you think your audience will find interesting and useful.</li><li> Upload photos/videos for your audience to engage with: Videos and photos are the most-shared type of content on Facebook. While links to articles are great, try mixing it up and incorporating photos and videos when possible.</li><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Twitter Tips <br/>  </h3><p> Twitter is a microblogging website which allows users to &ldquo;Tweet&rdquo; short messages of 140 characters or less. Twitter users can use Tweets to connect with other users and engage in ongoing conversations. Check out these Twitter tips:</p><li> Use Hashtags: Use hashtags, when appropriate. Using an excessive amount of hashtags can degrade the quality of your posts and show that you&rsquo;re not an experienced Twitter user. Instead, use them sparingly only when they are relevant to conversations going on around Twitter. For example, check out the &ldquo;Trends&rdquo; panel on the left side of your Twitter feed. You&rsquo;ll see the most popular hashtags of the day, and can use these to join in on an ongoing conversation.</li><li> Use @mentions to start a conversation or reply to others: Remember that Twitter is meant to be interactive, so using the &ldquo;@&rdquo; symbol to bring other users into a conversation is a great idea. Why not ask an industry thought leader what they think about your newest blog post? There are many ways to leverage conversations in Twitter to increase your content&rsquo;s engagement.</li><li> Retweet people: Retweet news sources/other financial professionals when you think their content would be useful to your follows. Since Twitter is all about interaction, retweeting other users creates a more dynamic experience for your followers. Not to mention it takes some of the pressure off you to constantly create new content!</li><li> User shorter messages: Although Twitter allows for messages up to 140 characters, the shorter the message the better! Shorter messages are more likely to attract attention and promote interaction.</li><li> Follow people: To make sure that your Twitter feed is packed with relevant industry news follow lots of your colleagues, industry leaders, and your favorite news sources. Chances are, if you have a website you frequent or a new station you rely on, they probably have a Twitter account you can follow too.</li><h3> Social Media Best Practices</h3><p> Here are some general social media best practices that you can follow, no matter what site you&rsquo;re on:</p><li> Define a purpose/goal: Create a social media goal for your firm so you can focus your effort on meeting this goal. Creating a goal for each site you&rsquo;re going to use can be especially helpful. For example: increase brand awareness by growing our fan page &ldquo;likes&rdquo; on Facebook. Or: grow my referral network by connecting with other financial professionals on LinkedIn.</li><li> Check out what other people are doing: If you&rsquo;re new to a specific social media site, don&rsquo;t start posting immediately. First, take some time to check out what other users are posting and sharing on the site.</li><li> Consistent branding: No matter which social media sites you&rsquo;re on, make sure that your branding is consistent. This means using your firm&rsquo;s logo and other branded elements across all sites.</li><li> Build a large network: Social media is meant to be well, social! So, connect with people, potential resources, and authority figures in your industry. The larger network you can create, the better.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t comment on financial strategies/products: Although interacting on social media is important, take care not to comment on any specific financial strategies or products. This could be misinterpreted as a recommendation, and trigger a fiduciary duty.</li><li> Balance is key: When creating your posts make sure to maintain a mixture of self-promotion, educational resources, and sharing other people&rsquo;s content. A little self-promotion is fine, but try to focus more on sharing valuable resources with your followers.</li><li> Social media is social: You shouldn&rsquo;t just spend time creating your own posts, but also interacting with other people&rsquo;s posts/content. Try commenting on something you found interesting, or sharing a great blog post written by one of your colleagues.</li><li> Be relevant: Make sure you&rsquo;re sharing interesting, relevant content to keep your followers engaged. Check out our tips on how to be relevant on social media below.</li><p> <img src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/category/advisor\"/></p><h3> How to be Relevant <br/>  </h3><p> The key to effectively utilizing social media is to share interesting, relevant content. This could include anything from videos to blog posts, to white papers, to case studies, etc. Basically, anything that solves a problem or creates awareness about an industry hot topic is good. Here are some tips to help you stay relevant on social media:</p><li> Share links to website updates, featured articles in the company newsletter, and new blog posts</li><li> Comment on daily news/events</li><li> Share your perspective as an advisor, highlighting issues clients should discuss with a financial professional</li><li> Provide general information about financial/retirement planning</li><li> Pose a question to generate conversation around a specific topic</li><li> Utilize multimedia like video, audio, or photos to help your posts stand out</li><h3> Social Media Management Software <br/>  </h3><p> Just like you use technology to streamline other parts of your firm&rsquo;s operations, technology can help you manage your firm&rsquo;s social media too.

Does it compel people to become more interested in you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four parts to a powerful bio or a Summary Section in LinkedIn. Following is a simple formula that asks questions designed to produce the four paragraphs of your bio. As you answer the questions, you will be improving and giving clarity to the most important message about you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First Paragraph: Answer the question, &ldquo;Why am I in this business?&rdquo; Think about how you got into this business, why do you what you do, and what the meaning is for you.

Professor K. Anders Ericson and his colleagues at Florida State University have studied elite performers, including musicians, athletes, actors and chess players. In each of these fields, Dr. Ericsson found that the best performers typically practice in uninterrupted sessions that last no more than 90 minutes. They begin in the morning, take a break between sessions, and rarely work for more than four and a half hours in any given day.</p><p> Makes sense, right? Tony Schwartz, CEO of The Energy Project, described in a New York Times OpEd piece how he applies this insight to his work life:</p><p> For my first three books, I sat at my desk for up to 10 hours a day. Each of the books took me at least a year to write. For my two most recent books, I wrote in three uninterrupted 90-minute sessions &ndash; beginning first thing in the morning, when my energy was highest &ndash; and took a break after each one &hellip; Writing just four and half hours a day, I completed both books in less than six months and spent my afternoons on less demanding work. (Relax! You&rsquo;ll Be More Productive; 2/9/2013)</p><p> Powerful, isn&rsquo;t it? But how do we apply the 90/10 rule to a work routine that&rsquo;s parceled into 30- and 60-minute chunks &ndash; especially when the parceling is not always controlled by us? Consider this:</p><h3> Transitions <br/>  </h3><p> Running from one 1-hour meeting to the next 1-hour meeting is mental insanity. Our mind has no time to process and reflect on what happened in one meeting; it simply isn&rsquo;t mentally ready for the next one. Shorten your meetings by 5 minutes. Create transition time. Make transitions part of your work flow. The moment you decide to do so, you will be astounded by how easy it actually is to implement.</p><h3> 5-Minute Check-Outs <br/>  </h3><p> Schedule 5-minute-intervals throughout the day when you stop and check out. You decide what &ldquo;checking out&rdquo; looks like for you. Hint: Checking emails is checking in, not checking out.</p><p> A check-out might be: Sitting in the office and closing your eyes; listening to music that calms or inspires you; doing a series of vigorous body stretches; writing in a personal journal; laying down on a sofa or the floor; being still. You decide!</p><h3> Bundle your Communications <br/>  </h3><p> I know, I know, this may sound utopian &ndash; but experiment with NOT checking emails every 5 or 10 minutes. NOT compulsively clicking on Facebook or LinkedIn. NOT acting on every whim to send a text message.</p><p> Bundling is old-school time management. We allot specific stretches of time for specific communication activities. Writing time, email time, social media time, phone-call time. In our increasingly distracted world, this is becoming harder and harder to do. When we stick with one communication mode at a time, we sharpen our communication focus. We are more impactful in every activity we perform. And we conserve the energy that gets frittered away by our frenzied, less disciplined use of time.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Think of 90/10 as the ideal. And yes, I get it, our work world is rarely ideal. But the more our habits approximate the 90/10 principle, the more energized and effective our days become. Go and experiment. Reap the rewards of a more intentional use of your time!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-26 14:49:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-26 14:49:11.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_6eC2CTE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/analyzing-the-90-10-principle-and-why-you-should-embrace-it/\", \"post_id\": \"12756\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-26 14:49:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-26 14:49:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"analyzing-the-90-10-principle-and-why-you-should-embrace-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12755\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6191\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/analyzing-9010-principle-and-why-you-should-embrace-it.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1673\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469620800,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}

After all, that&rsquo;s what we get paid to do, right? <br/>  </h3><p> Well, maybe not. Or not entirely, at least.</p><p> Not every client is created equal. When I started out in sales, I had to learn that lesson the hard way. In fact, it almost got me fired when I got it wrong the first time.</p><p> Anyone who&rsquo;s just starting out thinks that any client is a great client. Budding sales professionals. Scrappy startups. Aspiring consultants who strike out on their own after years in the corporate grind.</p><p> In many cases, the pressure to get that first gig is so great that they&rsquo;ll do virtually anything to land their first paying client.</p><p> Understandable, right?</p><p> But what if I told you that even seasoned sales professionals go after the wrong kind of business ? That even those who have ten, twenty or even thirty years of experience in sales and business development end up chasing deals that are not only not worth their time, but will harm their business rather than help it ?</p><p> Some clients are fussy. Difficult to work with. They&rsquo;ll try to squeeze you on scope, materials, or time. Some clients, in short, don&rsquo;t deserve your business.</p><p> But telling them apart can be tricky. After all, even difficult clients tend to present themselves in a favourable light, at least at first.</p><p> Over time, I&rsquo;ve found a few &laquo; tried and tested &raquo; methods that help me steer clear of those clients who will waste my time, and spend more time working with those who will be worth my time.</p><h3> Know what you do (and what you don&rsquo;t) <br/>  </h3><p> The first trick is to figure out what you do, and what you don&rsquo;t. Sounds simple enough, but if you dig a little deeper, you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s not always that clear-cut. Especially if you&rsquo;re selling services, there&rsquo;s often no clear delineation of what you offer, versus what you could offer. And a real temptation to &laquo; do more &raquo; (which can, sometimes, be a really, really good idea).</p><p> It&rsquo;s often tempting to accept a piece of business thinking &laquo; we don&rsquo;t really do that, but I&rsquo;m sure we could do it &raquo;. If you&rsquo;re selling training, you could do coaching as well. Or consulting. Or maybe even some kind of audit.</p><p> The problem is: none of this is playing to your core strengths.</p><p> Which means you&rsquo;ll have to invest substantially more resources than you would otherwise. And there&rsquo;s a real possibility of substantial scope creep.</p><p> Take it from me: unless you&rsquo;re making a strategic move, stick to what you know, and what you do best.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Develop a keen eye for telltale signs of trouble <br/>  </h3><p> In retrospect, every bad client I&rsquo;ve ever worked with gave off plenty of warning signs &ndash; I just didn&rsquo;t see them. Or, probably more accurately, I didn&rsquo;t want to see them.</p><p> Bad clients tend to be the ones who &ndash; in the early stages of the sales process &ndash; don&rsquo;t get back to you, leave things hanging and fire endless new requests at you. They&rsquo;re the ones who expect things to be turned around overnight, after sending an email at 6.00 PM. The ones who will behave as if they&rsquo;re the only client in the world.</p><p> If they&rsquo;re a pain to work with before you close the deal, imagine what they&rsquo;ll be like after you&rsquo;ve successfully won the business.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Qualify early, qualify hard <br/>  </h3><p> Here&rsquo;s a little secret: the fastest, surest, easiest way to make your win rates go up ? Chase fewer deals to begin with.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re out there chasing every potential lead, you&rsquo;ll only end up diluting your efforts, spending a lot of time with prospects who will never buy from you (and if they do, it may not even be worth your time).</p><p> The secret to higher win rates and better clients is to qualfy hard, and qualify early in the sales process.</p><p> Unfortunately, most sales professionals don&rsquo;t do enough of that. Why not ? Not enough leads entering their pipeline to start with &ndash; meaning they&rsquo;re desperately chasing every deal out there just to make the quarter.</p><h3> Find your best clients, and clone them <br/>  </h3><p> Think about your best clients. What do they have in common? What industries are they in? What products or services to they sell? What size are they? Where are they located? What did you do for them? Who are they?</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve got the answers to these questions, you can start building an ideal client profile. Meaning you can now choose who you go after, and get more dream clients into your pipeline.</p><h3> Stick to scope, and don&rsquo;t give in <br/>  </h3><p> Despite your best efforts to repel the wrong clients, you&rsquo;ll find that you&rsquo;ll still get stuck with a nightmare client from time to time. Don&rsquo;t fret, it happens to the best of us.</p><p> Nightmare clients tend to be really good at one thing : getting you to do more work for the same amount (or less) of money. But whatever you do, don&rsquo;t give in. If you do, it&rsquo;ll lead to a destructive downwards spiral of scope creep that you&rsquo;ll never be able to recover from.</p><p> Sales is all about getting new business &ndash; but not all new business is created equal. I&rsquo;ve written on the Pareto Principle before: 80% of your profits, results, joy, energy, fun and satisfaction will come from 20% of your clients.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to repel the wrong clients, so you can spend more time working with the right ones.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-26 14:51:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-26 14:51:37.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_jDHkWkr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-must-repel-the-wrong-clients-to-attract-the-right-ones/\", \"post_id\": \"12758\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-26 14:51:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-26 14:51:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-must-repel-the-wrong-clients-to-attract-the-right-ones\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12757\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6192\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-you-must-repel-wrong-clients-attract-right-ones.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"967\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469606400,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}

With Christian Magoon, founder and CEO of Amplify Investments and an ETF industry pioneer, and Financial Products Research CEO and ETF Business Review founder Rob Ivanoff sitting alongside me onstage, the conversation quickly shifted toward how marketing can make or break the success of a newly issued ETF.</p><p> With 284 exchange-traded products launched in 2015 and 132 new launches so far this year, differentiating your fund when bringing it to market is a challenging task. Not only are there a limited number of truly innovative ideas, but the top 10 issuers are bringing new products to market at a faster rate than the upstarts and boutiques in the ETF arena. The cards may appear to be stacked against the smaller-sized ETF issuers looking to break into the limelight as most firms do not have the advertising budget of industry giants like Vanguard, nor a celebrity endorsement like Kevin O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s suite of products from O&rsquo;Shares Investments.</p><p> These obstacles aside, space remains for new ETFs from smaller players to infiltrate the crowded landscape. However, it requires a coordinated attack with the right marketing, distribution and media-relations weaponry. As noted by Magoon and Ivanoff during the recent ETF panel, and as evidenced by Gregory FCA&rsquo;s countless successful ETF launches, there are a few surefire tactics ETF issuers can use to make a splash in the sea of competition.</p><h3> 1. Ensure your ETF represents something new</h3><p>  </p><p> ETFs are a dime a dozen, and unless your idea inherently captures the attention of investors with a unique value proposition, it will be a difficult sell in such a congested arena. Look for different trends in the investing world. What&rsquo;s in vogue right now? Find a product capturing the momentum of the day and ride the wave of AUM growth. We witnessed this opportunism firsthand with the launch of PureFunds&rsquo; cyber security ETF and with Alerian&rsquo;s first-to-market MLP ETF, AMLP.</p><h3> 2. Explain or demonstrate the novelty and its value <br/>  </h3><p> Investors and the financial media alike want to hear a good story. Ensure the novelty of your product can be illustrated in a way that resonates with the investing community. A product developed solely for the purpose of being unique is not enough. It must embody a rising trend or popularizing strategy that delivers value in order to capture attention. Look for holes of opportunity in the market where people want to invest but lack a cost-efficient vehicle to do so, as the aforementioned Magoon has done with his firm&rsquo;s Online Retail ETF.</p><h3> 3. Coordinate marketing and sales efforts <br/>  </h3><p> Your marketing and sales efforts need to seamlessly coincide throughout every stage of a product launch. Purchase software that pinpoints investors holding similar securities to those in your ETF and target them with your marketing materials. Distinguish your product with affinity groups by catering your messaging points and value proposition to their specific needs. Both efforts need to be firing simultaneously before and after the launch to ensure your product gains traction on the open market.</p><h3> 4. Build credibility through media relations <br/>  </h3><p> With so many options to pick from, retail investors can have a hard time choosing from the pack. For example, more than a dozen dividend-oriented ETFs have launched this year alone. Nothing differentiates your product and builds credibility in the minds of investors quite like seeing it discussed in reputable financial media outlets.

That LinkedIn profile has been tweaked and tweaked and you are pretty sure its &ldquo;Buyer-centric&rdquo;.</p><p> You have worked out how to find (curate) and maybe you have even had a go creating your own content.</p><p> This means you are a social seller, all you have to sit back and &hellip;&hellip;. What do you think happens?</p><h3> Social Selling First Principles  <br/>  </h3><p> Let&rsquo;s go back to first principles, why did we turn our LinkedIn profile, a CV to attract recruiters into a buyer-centric profile to attract buyers?</p><p> Buyers are going online and using social in &ldquo;ignore salespeople mode&rdquo; to do research for good and services. What happens if they get wise to what salespeople do? And they bypass Buyer-Centric Profiles? Or maybe you have one of those profiles that look like a \"salespeople that have been on a LinkedIn course\" type profile? Came across a sales team last week that had a LinkedIn training course the three months before and they said, \"it was nothing like the course we gave at my company Digital Leadership Associates (DLA)\". I'm not surprised, their profiles looked like sales people that had been on a LinkedIn course, rather than a Social Selling course, which we at DLS deliver.</p><p> With digital and social the world has changed and keeps changing, and with that sales people and Social Selling keeps changing.  If your LinkedIn profile is not giving you inbound, you are doing it wrong!</p><h3> So what do you do next? - Build a Community <br/>  </h3><p> As part of your selling activity you need to build a community. This is no different that what you have done off-line to manage a territory, but you need to do this on-line. What do I mean?</p><p> If for example, you sell into the Manufacturing space, you will have built up an understanding of the market and be passionate about it.  In my sales territory I know everything that goes on, and I know everybody.  You should be able to talk to your prospects and customers about the latest and greatest. What do you think about 3D Printing? Do you see Augmented Reality applicable in your areas? These may not impact on what you are selling, but it shows you have a point of view and gains you more market knowledge and insight.  The person people want to know.</p><h3> Who in Your Community is a Mover and Shaker? <br/>  </h3><p> As you prospect in the accounts you will understand whom the &ldquo;movers and shakers&rdquo; are, let&rsquo;s call them influencers. These people maybe academics, consultants, customers and prospects.  Connect with them and build relationships with them.  You should already do this off-line, but now you can do this, and at scale, online.</p><p> You will also know people in your customers; you will also have made contact with people within your competitors. Connect with them on-line.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Everything I&rsquo;ve written above can all be created and completed off-line. It was how I sold in the 1990s and still sell today. But ....</p><p> Fast-forward to the digital age and that all can replicated on-line, or put it another way. With your customers and prospects being online, it is a bit pointless you working with your Rolodex in offline mode.  Be a community builder!</p><h3> A Buyer-Centric LinkedIn Profile is Passive Social Selling, Time to up Your Game! <br/>  </h3><p> As part of personal branding, building a community and influence is paramount. It is more likely to generate for you the inbound requests, you want from buyers as you hack the buying process.</p><p> In my book, Social Selling, I discuss in practical steps how salespeople can own their Territory and build influence and community, locking the competition out. Play your cards right and like a moth to a light, the moment a prospect hits your online community they will be drawn to your commanding position.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-26 14:59:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-26 14:59:26.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_GkVXPlv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/whats-next-after-setting-up-your-personal-brand-on-twitter-and-linkedin/\", \"post_id\": \"12762\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-26 14:59:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-26 14:59:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"whats-next-after-setting-up-your-personal-brand-on-twitter-and-linkedin\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12761\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6194\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/whats-next-after-setting-your-personal-brand-twitter-and-linkedin.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"572\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469646000,"author_id":482,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5946,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Inheritance: 3 Steps to Handle the Details","link":"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details-2","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You find out you&rsquo;re receiving an inheritance and the first thing that comes to mind is &ndash; What next?Inheritances can provide incredible flexibility but without effective  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/our-services/financial-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financial planning  </a> </u> , you may miss some of the organized steps needed to get there.This process is often emotional and can create extra decision-making that seems daunting.Helping many clients through this process, we&rsquo;ve made a list of several of the more important things to accomplish when you know an inheritance may be coming your way.</p><h3> 1. Take Inventory</h3>One of the first and most important steps is to determine where accounts are located and how they are registered.  If you are the executor/executrix this will help to determine if you have access to liquid assets so that you can pay any outstanding bills and taxes.If you are not the executor, you would still like to know how the accounts are registered to assure they are handled in the most tax-efficient manner.For assets in non-retirement accounts, assets receive a step-up in basis equal to the date of death value (or the alternate valuation date which is 6 months later, if elected by the executor).<h3> 2. Stretch your IRA withdrawals</h3>You discover you are the beneficiary on an IRA, so how will you be taxed? This is not an issue for spouses, as they can change the name of the Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and make it their own. But if you are a non-spouse beneficiary, you have several options, including withdrawing the money outright, withdrawing over 5 years or stretching withdrawals over your lifetime.Your first move will be to set up an<strong>  inherited IRA</strong> in your own name before making this decision.  Because any withdrawals from a traditional IRA will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, calculate your tax liability before acting.If the deceased owner was already past the minimum distribution date (70 &frac12;), you will have to follow the distribution schedule they already started.  But if the owner was under 70 &frac12;, you likely have the option of using your own life expectancy for the mandatory annual withdrawals required by the IRS.Consulting a financial planner will help you with the account set-up and appropriate distribution schedule.<h3> 3. Determine your Risk Preferences</h3>An important factor in the amount of risk in your investment strategy depends heavily on the direction of your cash flow.  Taking large withdrawals necessitates a lower stock allocation while saving, or not withdrawing funds, allows for a higher stock allocation.The best way to determine how much you should have invested in stock investments is to complete a <u> <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/our-services/financial-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financial plan </a></u>.  The plan first helps you to determine a priority schedule in uses for the inheritance:<li> High-interest debt pay down</li><li> Savings (retirement and short-term)</li><li> Large extraordinary type of expenses</li>After factoring in these objectives along with your income, you will have year by year targets for income, savings, debts and expenses.  With this information, and from conversations with your financial planner, we begin our <u> <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/our-services/investment-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  investment management service </a></u> which helps to implement recommendations to reach the appropriate amount of risk for your situation.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 17:42:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 17:42:46.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_NkGyxH4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/?p=5083\", \"post_id\": \"5083\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 10:42:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 17:42:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details-2\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12761\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2290\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/whats-next-after-setting-your-personal-brand-twitter-and-linkedin.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"392\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"289\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2015-07-29\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438261200,"author_id":100,"chart_url":""}

The reality for many advisors is the day to day running of their practice often acts as a diversion from this most important point of focus.  As you succeed, continue to grow, and become involved with more clients, there never seems to be enough hours in the day.Then one day it happens &ndash; an ACAT form hits your desk or, if you have truly brave clients, a phone call explaining how you shouldn&rsquo;t take it personally but they are moving their account to another firm.  You ask yourself, &ldquo;Why and how this could happen?&rdquo;We&rsquo;ve all heard it. &ldquo;Frequency of client communication trumps investment performance when it comes to client satisfaction.&rdquo;Ironstone&rsquo;s research on Practice Management shows a majority of advisors candidly admitting that infrequent client communication is a common pitfall.  And when clients were asked what their primary reason for leaving an advisor was, their answer was lack of contact and/or communication.So why is there such a disconnect, and more importantly, what can be done about it?A number of items come to mind which might serve to preclude this painful event: such as more efficient time management, delegation of administrative responsibility, or even simply blocking time for reach outs to clients on a regular and consistent basis.We have had a number of advisors ask, &ldquo;What is the right amount and frequency of contact with clients?&rdquo; &ldquo;What media should be used?&rdquo;  You know your clients best, but here are some key points to consider:</p><li> Segment your clients into A, B, and C clients to ensure that you&rsquo;re delivering top-notch service to your best clients.</li><li> Manage your client&rsquo;s expectations &ndash; but also manage YOUR OWN and be sure to ask them how frequently they would like to hear from you.</li><li> Schedule client meetings a month out and confirm a week ahead so your calendar is full and your clients are prepared.</li><li> Stay in touch with investors throughout the year using social media: including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Even newsletters still work!</li><li> What is the best way to communicate? Email, Text, or Snail mail? They&rsquo;ll tell you what their delivery preference is.

That is a lot of competition.  You have to compete with people in your same building, across the street, and across the country.As if the competition wasn&rsquo;t enough, you also have another hurdle, commoditization.  The industry, for the most part, has become a commoditized business.  If you ask the typical &lsquo;Joe/Jane Investor,&rsquo; they will tell you that all advisors are the same.  After all, they all sell actively managed accounts, ETFs, insurance, mutual funds, and some alternative investments, right?A recent Pershing Study* cites 60% of investors found it hard to distinguish among advisors because most said the same things and made the same promises.Put both of these issues together and you have a challenge.  How do you stand out and make yourself different in a world where you have so much competition and are viewed as a commodity?We all know first impressions matter, whether on a blind date, a job interview, or choosing an investment advisor.  An advisor&rsquo;s<strong> value proposition</strong>is often the first impression a potential client experiences and is often the catalyst for a future relationship.  The value prop statement should answer the question, &ldquo;Why should I choose you?&rdquo;It all comes down to first, how you present yourself, and then how and<strong> when</strong>you present your value proposition.Let&rsquo;s start with the first item.  When a prospective client asks, &ldquo;what do you do?&rdquo; - there is nothing you can say, no words that can come out of your mouth so compelling, that it will stimulate curiosity on their part to learn more about your practice.  Most of the elevator speeches I have heard over the past 20 years activate a &lsquo;sales alert,&rsquo; which is highly sensitive with today&rsquo;s affluent.  The reason this holds true is, &lsquo;no one likes to be sold!&rsquo;What<strong> should</strong>you do?  First, understand the nature of the question in conventional social circles and the real opportunity it affords.  It&rsquo;s unlikely the person asking the question has any real interest in your career, it&rsquo;s merely a conversation starter.The real opportunity is for you to connect with the prospective client by not doing what<strong> every other</strong>advisor does which is talk about what they do, how they do it, and how professional they are at doing it.  Rather be OTHER FOCUSED, because the more you make it about them and less about you, the more quickly you build rapport.Here&rsquo;s an example (the scenario is a fundraiser for Children&rsquo;s Cancer Centers of America):<strong> Potential Client:</strong>So what do you do for a living?<strong> Financial Advisor:</strong>I guide a handful of families in the area who have entrusted my team to oversee their assets in order to impact the legacy of their families.  PAUSE &ndash; So how did you get involved in this fundraiser?<strong> Potential Client:</strong>A few years ago a girl in my daughter&rsquo;s dance class was diagnosed with XYZ.  It was absolutely shocking that this 8 year old kid had to go through this terrible disease, and just as shocking to see her family almost declare bankruptcy. I learned about this facility that would co-opt the cost of the treatment and I have been hooked ever since.The sooner you can move the conversation away from you and your business in that first interaction, the more likely it is you&rsquo;ll get new business in the long run.  It&rsquo;s what I like to refer to as, &ldquo;keeping the<strong> Shark Teeth</strong>in your back pocket.&rdquo;Pershing went on to say, the strongest value propositions incorporated four key elements: attributes of the advisor, benefits for the investor, a rational explanation of how the firm&rsquo;s attributes benefit the client, and language that evokes EMOTION.There is an amazing book and TED Talk by Simon Sinek (<u> <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  YouTube </a></u>) that drives home the importance of infusing emotion in your value proposition and the way in which you brand yourself which is entitled &lsquo;<strong> Start With Why</strong>&rsquo;.  If you are not familiar with Simon Sinek, you need to be.Sinek states that today&rsquo;s clients are more sophisticated than ever, but also more cynical and desire more than the same promises, guarantees, or assurances provided by the vast majority of Financial Advisors.  Thus it makes sense to move beyond functional benefits and consider self-expressive, social, and emotional benefits as a basis for a value proposition.  Every advisor is quick to say what they do and maybe how they do it.  Few can clearly articulate<strong> WHY</strong>they do what they do &ndash; and therein lies all the difference!An emotional benefit relates to the ability of the brand to make the buyer or user of the brand feel something during the purchase process or user experience.  Think Volvo: Safe / Think Coca-Cola: Refreshed / Think Apple: Creative.So ask yourself, how are you articulating your practice&rsquo;s brand and what emotion does it evoke among your clients, prospects, and centers of influence?*The Second Annual study of Advisory Success-Pershing /<u> <a href=\"http://www.pershing.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  www.pershing.com </a></u>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 17:39:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 17:39:08.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_NIHU5Xz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/?p=6000\", \"post_id\": \"6000\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 10:39:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 17:39:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-be-a-horse-of-a-different-color-framing-the-what-how-and-when-of-your-value-proposition\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5999\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2744\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-10-at-7.43.07-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"643\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"297\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2015-09-10\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442061000,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}

They are highly energetic attempting to sell their expertise as it applies to office. <strong>  Hope is high that the voters will &ldquo;buy&rdquo; what they put out. </strong> This is true for all of the political parties.</p><h3> Trust and Credibility Begin the Sale</h3>Putting &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the best&rdquo; aside, credibility and trust begin with evidence of prior experience. Consistency is next for words, actions, and deeds, in order for the audience to determine where the person might be headed.When errors are made, the best step is to admit them and move on. Just yesterday, I became slightly irritated about a time discrepancy until I recognized I&rsquo;m the one who erred. With immediacy, I took responsibility.Trust and credibility applies to everything we do in our professional and personal lives to include the job seeking process and career advancement.<h3> The Poor Spin</h3>Backtracking is never a good idea. Very few candidates seem to take responsibility. Instead, they try to put a different picture frame on what was previously said or done, in the hope all will be forgotten. Instead, the news hammers and magnifies those points turning the spin tactic into a poor tactic.<h3> The Improved SPIN</h3>A different type of <u> <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1LVwRei\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SPIN Selling System </a></u> was developed by Neil Rackham. In fact, it greatly increased my sales accomplishments. In this case, SPIN is an acronym for determining where you are best able to help your clientele. The letters stand for Situation &ndash; Problem &ndash; Implied problems and Need(s).  I highly recommend the book.It would also be smart for the candidates to read it themselves to consider what they are saying, doing, and conveying to their audiences. In particular, there is need to consider where improvement might be made.<h3> Selling One&rsquo;s Candidacy</h3><li> <strong>  Admit past errors but include lessons learned and how they may be applied to the position </strong></li><li> <strong>  Speak to the big vision hoping to be accomplished </strong></li><li> <strong>  Speak to the current major issues and how experience may serve to resolve these </strong></li><li> <strong>  Speak to needs of the audience and how some area of their life may be improved </strong></li><li> <strong>  With credibility and trust in hand, forge a relationship with the voters </strong></li><li> <strong>  Connect with voters somewhat personally to build a stronger relationship </strong></li><h3> Client Perspective</h3>Candidates are proposing to be a representative of the voters. Therefore candidates need to seriously consider the perspective of voters; particularly the undecided. Study history and how we have arrived at where we are today. Speak to the pain points and how they might be alleviated. Address what has transpired, offer new ideas for consideration, and negotiate a good conclusion with a powerful speech.Politics is one grand sale.

{"original_id":5950,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Secret To Getting What You Want In Life","link":"the-secret-to-getting-what-you-want-in-life","source_link":null,"content":"<strong> A few years back I entered a 6 mile race called the Jingle Bell Run with some of my fellow FBI agents. Within the first few yards they pulled away and left me behind. Desperate to keep my legs churning under me as fast as I could, I drew a bead on their quickly disappearing backs until they were so far ahead of me I could no longer see them.</strong>And then, as we entered the last mile, a woman pushing a stroller sailed past me. The child sitting in the stroller weighed about 40 pounds&mdash;to add insult to injury.I wish I could tell you this was a joke, but it wasn&rsquo;t. I felt both defeated and humiliated. I watched as the woman&rsquo;s back quickly disappeared into the crowd as well. By now, I was limping along with runners from the Shady Rest Retirement Community.I thought about dropping out of the race altogether, but I willed myself to keep moving ahead even though I was gasping for breath and barely able to move.The capacity to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the call of temptation and desire to quit is called willpower.Willpower is the ability to find the energy, motivation, and enthusiasm to keep going even when you&rsquo;re tired, anxious, and looking for a way out.Here are 7 ways you can use willpower to get everything you want in life:<h3> 1. Keep Your Eye On The Big Picture</h3>Make sure your goals and priorities are clear in your mind. You must be able to make the choice that matters when you run into difficulties and feel like giving up.Willpower takes energy because you must use mental toughness to control your thoughts, emotions, and behavior.<h3> 2. Connect Your Activity To Your WHY</h3>To activate your willpower, you must be able to remind yourself WHY it&rsquo;s important for you to do something.  When you have a purpose and are engaged in activities that are freighted with both value and meaning, you have the beginning of willpower because you are committed to your goal.Dump the trivia because meaningless tasks do not activate willpower.<h3> 3. Pare Down Decisions</h3>School uniforms are popular for a reason: they reduce the number of choices students have to make every morning. President Obama only wears blue or gray suits. He told Vanity Fair that he doesn&rsquo;t want to make decisions about what he wears because he has so many other decisions to make.Fewer decisions allow you to find the energy, motivation, and stamina to keep going even when you&rsquo;re tired or anxious.<h3> 4. Train Your Brain</h3>You can make the willpower centers of your brain more dense and better connected by meditating every day. Neuroscientists have found that meditation leads to better focus and self-control after just 3 hours of practice. MRI scans show increased neural connection in brain regions responsible for impulse control.Don&rsquo;t worry if you think you are &ldquo;bad at meditation.&rdquo; <u> <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201004/meditate-your-way-more-willpower\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The act of constantly pushing away intrusive thoughts </a></u> is precisely what trains the brain and strengthens willpower.<h3> 5. Defer Gratification</h3>Success usually comes down to choosing the pain of discipline over the ease of compliance. So, if you want to succeed at something, at some point you will need to ignore doing easier things in favor of doing something harder.Willpower is the ability to <u> <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  delay gratification </a></u>, resisting short-term temptations in order to meet long-term goals.<h3> 6. Be Optimistic</h3>When we increase our optimism, we increase our willpower to accomplish a task. When we mix optimism with willpower, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Studies have shown that if we raise our expectations of success, we find ways to overcome the temptations or obstacles that might pop up along the way.Our ability to overcome an obstacle depends upon how likely we think we&rsquo;ll be able to overcome it.<h3> 7. Change Your Mindset</h3>People who think that willpower is limited are always on the lookout for signs of fatigue. But people who believe that willpower is not limited only dig deeper and find more resources.<u> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/opinion/sunday/willpower-its-in-your-head.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print\" target=\"_blank\">  Recent findings by Greg Walton and Carol Dweck </a></u> fly in the face of what has been preached about willpower for years&mdash;that willpower is limited and that we need constant glucose boosts throughout the day.If we have a growth mindset, we will work harder and dig deeper to find the willpower we need to overcome our obstacle or reach our goals. According to Walton and Dweck, willpower can indeed be quite limited&mdash;but only if you believe it is. When people believe that willpower is fixed and limited, their willpower is easily depleted.But when people believe that willpower is self-renewing&mdash;that when you work hard, you&rsquo;re energized to work more; that when you&rsquo;ve resisted one temptation, you can better resist the next one&mdash;then people successfully exert more willpower. It turns out that willpower is in your head.I&rsquo;m glad I finished the Jingle Bell Run because every obstacle I work through makes the achievement that much more valuable. Giving up is often the easiest option in today&rsquo;s world, but it&rsquo;s important to think about how that choice may affect your life ten years from now.Don&rsquo;t live a life of regrets.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 17:36:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 17:36:29.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_FOQPHYG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/?p=6474\", \"post_id\": \"6474\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 10:36:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 17:36:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-secret-to-getting-what-you-want-in-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6473\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2978\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/run.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"873\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2015-10-01\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443802200,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5951,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why You Should Let Your Employees Dabble in Other Departments","link":"why-you-should-let-your-employees-dabble-in-other-departments","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Do your employees understand how other departments work? Or do they keep their heads down and focus a majority of their energies on fulfilling their own job descriptions? <br/>  </h3><p> While it makes perfect sense to expect your employees to tackle the responsibilities they were hired to tackle, there are many reasons why you should encourage your staff to step outside their comfort zones and work with folks outside their own departments &mdash; at least from time to time.</p><p> You never know when collaboration between your salespeople and engineers, for example, could end up producing an innovative tool that becomes popular overnight. Beyond that, encouraging your employees to work in other departments has a slew of other benefits, including:</p><h3> 1. It&rsquo;s a great way to break up the routine <br/>  </h3><p> You can&rsquo;t expect your employees to do the same tasks over and over again in perpetuity. Sooner or later, they&rsquo;re likely to burn out. By encouraging interdepartmental collaboration, you&rsquo;re giving your employees something to be excited about simply by switching things up. As a result, workers remain motivated and culture stays strong.</p><h3> 2. Employees get to develop professionally <br/>  </h3><p> According to our Employee Engagement Report, a mere 25% of workers feel as though their companies offer adequate professional development opportunities &mdash; this despite the fact that many workers crave them. Allow your workers to regularly put their heads together with colleagues in other departments, and you give them a way to develop new talents and learn new things &mdash; all without having to open up the company purse.</p><h3> 3. Workers can inspire one another <br/>  </h3><p> Two minds &mdash; or three or four &mdash; are often better than one. When employees from different departments that don&rsquo;t usually work with each other get together, there&rsquo;s no limit to the ideas that can materialize in conversation. Everyone has different backgrounds, different beliefs, and different approaches to work. You never know when the unlikeliest of people &mdash; say, someone in finance and someone in legal &mdash; will come up with a game-changing idea.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Employees understand the bigger picture better <br/>  </h3><p> When employees only focus on their own responsibilities, it&rsquo;s extremely difficult &mdash; if not altogether impossible &mdash; for them to understand how the company makes its secret sauce. On the other hand, when workers are able to join other departments once in a while, they gain a whole new perspective on how a different facet of their organization operates. This enables them to better understand the bigger picture, and they are also able to bring their own unique perspectives to new problems.</p><h3> 5. The team becomes that much stronger <br/>  </h3><p> In our engagement report, we also uncovered the fact that coworkers are the number one thing employees like about their jobs. When you let employees work with their peers in other departments, you increase the chances that additional personal bonds will be formed.

It went something like this:</p><p> &ldquo;So&hellip; I hope you don&rsquo;t mind me asking, but I looked you up online and you look awfully young to have started such a successful, innovative company&hellip; How old are you? Because, you look like you&rsquo;re 25.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I am not that young.&rdquo; Zhenya laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my round face. It makes me look younger. I am 41.&rdquo; There was a pause. &ldquo;Now&hellip; I find it only fair to ask you the same question.&rdquo;</p><p> I smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 35.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I used to place too much value on youth and beauty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I was in my twenties, I thought once I hit 40, I would be miserable. My age cutoff was 32. That&rsquo;s the age I decided marked me as officially being old.&rdquo; She laughed again. &ldquo;It was so silly. My forties are much, much better than my twenties or thirties. Life will get better for you too. You&rsquo;ll see. Your forties are great.&rdquo;</p><p> Not everyone has come to terms with growing older as well as Zhenya. I know someone, for example, who is so worried about becoming old that he regularly injects himself with testosterone and can&rsquo;t stop talking about all the botox he&rsquo;s going to need to &ldquo;stay relevant&rdquo; in our youth-based culture.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Believe me, I get it. It can be terrifying to see wrinkles when you stare in the mirror or get an eye roll from a teenager because you can&rsquo;t operate your new iPhone app. There&rsquo;s a lot of unpleasant things about aging. But there&rsquo;s a lot of joy too.</p><p> In fact, recent studies reveal that happiness for many people increases in their 40s, 50s and well into their 70s (providing they are in relatively good health). One study in the UK that interviewed over 300,000 adults found that the most-content age group was 65-79.</p><p> Nancy Galambos, researcher of a study at the University of Alberta, surveyed over 1,500 participants and found that those in their 40s were happier than 18-year-olds. &ldquo;Life is more difficult for younger people than for people in middle age,&rdquo; Galambos concluded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty. But by middle age, a lot of people have worked that out and are quite satisfied through the earliest child-bearing years.&rdquo;</p><p> Biographies of top 100 founders on the Forbes List reveal that 35 is the most common age to start a top company. And many successful companies were started by people in their 40s (Costco, Ford, Volvo, Christian Dior, Comcast, Starbucks). As well as people in their 50s (Morgan Stanley, Nestl&eacute;, Est&eacute;e Lauder). Or even their 60s (Bank of America, IBM).</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> A Passion for People <br/>  </h3><p> Zhenya tries to live each day with purpose. &ldquo;At any given moment,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are the youngest you&rsquo;ll ever be.&rdquo; She spends her moments thinking up ways to change the health care industry and help as many people as possible. That&rsquo;s how her company, Enigma Health, was originally founded&mdash; based on an idea she had after watching several family members go through anxiety and fear after experiencing symptoms for issues that could not be pinpointed by a doctor. She said she worked day and night to get her company going and she was in the final stages of selling it when I spoke with her.</p><p> &ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo; I asked her.</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure yet,&rdquo; she said. But it&rsquo;s going to be something to do with helping people in the healthcare industry&mdash;something she is deeply passionate about. &ldquo;The more lives I can touch in a positive way, the better.&rdquo;</p><p> Besides a focus on meaningful work, Zhenya also takes time to build lasting relationships&mdash;hosting large dinner parties for family and visiting neighbors. One of the things she misses most about Russia, where she spent the first nineteen years of her life, is the sense of community, where neighbors stop in and chat with each other over tea. So, she tries to create that community around her. Some neighbors, she says, are happy to stop and chat. Others look at you like you&rsquo;re crazy. &ldquo;You learn which ones are more open pretty quickly,&rdquo; she said.</p><p> Her main hope for her two children is that they become good, kind, caring people. And that is what she tries to reinforce through her actions.</p><h3> No Room for Anxiety <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;I used to think I had to accomplish big things when I was young. You know, if I hadn&rsquo;t done something great by 23, I would never amount to anything.&rdquo; That kind of thinking immobilizes you, she says. It puts too much pressure on you to perform and creates anxiety and negativity.</p><p> &ldquo;There will be a lot of opportunities in this life,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should sit around and wait, but it also means that you shouldn&rsquo;t put too much pressure on yourself because that isn&rsquo;t going to help anything.</p><p> &ldquo;Life is very non-linear. When you&rsquo;re in a spot you&rsquo;re not satisfied with, it is easy to project that as a trend for the rest of your life. But the reality is life is not linear and some years are slow and unsatisfying and others are amazing. You just have to use the slow years to prep yourself to be ready to take advantage of the great opportunities when they come.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-26 15:04:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-26 15:04:06.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_gRdjnLm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/medical-innovator-zhenya-abbruzzese-on-why-her-best-years-are-still-ahead/\", \"post_id\": \"12766\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-26 15:04:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-26 15:04:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"medical-innovator-zhenya-abbruzzese-on-why-her-best-years-are-still-ahead\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12765\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6196\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/medical-innovator-zhenya-abbruzzese-why-her-best-years-are-still-ahead.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1059\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"269\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-07-14\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469631600,"author_id":294,"chart_url":""}

If you're not in good health, the tasks of giving care will fall short, not to mention the hardships and risks it places on you, which range from exhaustion, illness, and burnout.</p><p> The stresses of giving care work out in different forms and several studies report as many as one in three feel anxious and strained. And one in two, report they have less time to spend with their support system.</p><h3> To help relieve potential anxiety and stress, follow these tips: <br/>  </h3><li> Put your health first. Eat wholesome foods and avoid urges for desserts and sweets. Get plenty of sleep and if fatigued during the day, take a nap. Get a regular medical checkup, and if depressed and feel extreme sadness, talk to a medical professional.</li><li> Reach out to friends and family members. Do not isolate.</li><li> Get support and ask for help. List out what needs doing and ask others to pitch in.</li><li> Locate and call local resources like the Area Agency on Aging. They can suggest and make recommendations for assistance. Contact a home care agency to request the help of an aide. Volunteers from faith-based organizations or local groups can help with cooking or driving.</li><li> Take a break and consider respite care. Ask a friend to step in while you have lunch or run an errand. Contact an adult day care center for breaks during the day. Plan a longer break by going away for the weekend and turn to assisted living or residential care facilities for help. Some accept short-term stays.</li><li> Address your emotions. Don't keep them bottled up. Call a friend or family member and share your frustrations. Join a local caregiver support group or see a professional counselor.</li><li> Once each day, do something you enjoy. Take a walk outside, call a friend on the phone, read, dance, and listen to music. Some individuals meditate, pray, and visualize.</li><li> Get prepared and organized. Use a calendar to make a to-do list. And start the day by completing one task and work your way through it. Don't panic if you can't get to them all.</li><li> Don't be a people pleaser. It's okay to set boundaries and to say no. You cannot do everything and meet everyone's demands. Resist the urge to do more than you can handle.</li><li> Avoid pessimism and give yourself credit.</li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> By taking action, you can solve issues before they become problems.

Petersen</p><h3> You&rsquo;ve heard the numbers: it costs 4 to 10 times more to acquire a new client than to retain an existing one. It&rsquo;s why smart companies focus the bulk of their marketing and development efforts on current clients, and for companies like <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Starbucks </a> , it&rsquo;s been a strategy paved in gold.</h3>But what about advisors?  It&rsquo;s an entirely different challenge when your existing clients are retirees in their late 70s, 80s, and even older. In this case, even the most brilliant marketing strategy won&rsquo;t matter if client retention is the goal. This demographic is going to dwindle. Period.So what&rsquo;s the answer? How can you continue to grow your practice&mdash;without taking on 10 times the marketing cost? Take a cue from Starbucks and focus your efforts on today&rsquo;s biggest demographic: the aging Millennial.Today there are 75.8 million Baby Boomers in the US, and they&rsquo;ve been a boon to business for decades. You know them well; they&rsquo;re your friends, your colleagues, and the majority of your clients. And as the wealthiest generation in history, they&rsquo;ve had money to spend&mdash;and invest. But while Boomers may have taken consumerism to new heights, Millennials have upped the ante, catapulting brands and dictating the winners since before they could talk (remember<a href=\"http://www.barney.com/usa/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Barney</a>?).Here&rsquo;s the great news: Millennials just surpassed Baby Boomers as the largest living generation in the US. And the oldest of this group are your prime prospects: they&rsquo;re in their mid-30s and they&rsquo;re ripe for financial help. Even better, they&rsquo;re on deck to inherit the considerable wealth of yourexistingclients &ndash;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-transfer-of-wealth-in-history-2014-6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Boomers will transfer an astounding $30 trillion to their heirs over the next several decades</a>&ndash; so earning their business is all about retention, not prospecting.But to leverage that opportunity, &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; is not the answer. Millennials have a different view of the world, and to earn their trust in the future, you need to start thinking like them, acting like them, and delivering services that matter to them. Here are 5 steps to help make your practice as valuable to a Millennial as a Starbucks latte:<h3> <strong>  1. Get them in the room. </strong></h3>Don&rsquo;t restrict your Boomer meetings to the Boomers. Invite older clients to meet, and ask them to bring along their adult kids. Focus your discussion on the big questions few families ask, but all families should address: Do you have enough saved to avoid outliving your assets? What about long term care? Does selling a life insurance policy or another financial strategy make sense to cover immediate expenses? Open up the conversation and get the family talking about the future to be sure the right plans are in place to protect the existing estate.<h3> <strong>  2. Keep the conversation going. </strong></h3>Once you&rsquo;ve established a connection, don&rsquo;t restrict your conversation to the needs of the older parent. Millennials are facing their own financial needs. They&rsquo;re worrying about how to purchase a home, how to fund college for their kids, and how to start investing for their own retirement&mdash;which promises to exceed today&rsquo;s typical length by a good decade. They have work to do, and you&rsquo;re here to help.<h3> <strong>  3. Focus your marketing events on Millennials&mdash;not Boomers. </strong></h3>If you&rsquo;ve done a good job for your Baby Boomer clients, marketing to them isn&rsquo;t your biggest priority. Sure, have a wine tasting or a golf outing now and then, but it&rsquo;s time to do some serious marketing aimed at the next generation. Host a workshop on purchasing a first home. Invite them to a high-end sporting event or concert. Schedule technology sessions to teach them how to use apps like<a href=\"http://www.mhriley.com/spendingtracker/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Spending Tracker</a>and<a href=\"http://www.mint.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Mint</a>to help them budget and save better than ever. Earn their confidence now to earn their business later. (See<a href=\"/learn/investing-in-life/ready-to-take-on-next-gen-clients-a-robosaving-strategy-may-be-the-key\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Ready to Take on Next Gen Clients? A Robosaving Strategy May be the Key</a>).<h3> <strong>  4. Protect their inheritance. </strong></h3>Now that you both know (hopefully) where their parents&rsquo; money is going, offer to help put a plan in place to protect that inheritance. Don&rsquo;t assume they want to invest in the same way or you&rsquo;ll risk losing their business.<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/01/heres-why-millennials-arent-investing.html\" target=\"_blank\"> More than 80% of Millennials aren&rsquo;t investing in the stock market.</a>The reasons? They feel they don't have enough money, they don't know how to start, or they&rsquo;re swimming in student debt. Target these items specifically and start working together to get them started on a smarter path.<h3> <strong>  5. Think&mdash;and look&mdash;like a Millennial. </strong></h3>No, you aren&rsquo;t getting any younger, but even if you&rsquo;ve got just the right amount of gray to instill confidence in your Boomer clients, their kids are looking for an advisor who understands who they are and what they value. Brighten up the office. Trade in the blue suit for a polo shirt and khakis. Present your materials on an iPad. Offer videoconferencing, free Wi-Fi, and Starbucks. Add Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) or &ldquo;green&rdquo; investing to your services. And bring in staff who can relate to the next generation and get them involved&hellip;ideally through<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Twitter</a>,<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Facebook</a>, and<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com\" target=\"_blank\"> LinkedIn</a>.The best news: one of the great things about Millennials is that they&rsquo;re not just the biggest generation to date, they&rsquo;re also the most brand loyal. That means once you earn their business, you&rsquo;ll very likely have them as a client for a very (very!) long time. Keep evolving as they do, and you may very well have a business model that supports your practice for yourownnext generation. It all starts with making client retention a top priority and keeping those Baby Boomer assets in your book of business for decades to come.

How Do You Act as a Leader When the Temperature Shoots Up?","link":"attitude-matters-how-do-you-act-as-a-leader-when-the-temperature-shoots-up","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Leading Customer Insight teams isn&rsquo;t easy. <br/>  </h3><p> As the breadth of content on this site will show, a wide variety of skills and knowledge are needed to master the role. But, perhaps the greatest difference, in those customer insight leaders I see succeed, is their attitude. Compared to others, who &ldquo;get by&ldquo;, highly successful customer insight leaders understand that attitude matters.</p><p> To that end, I&rsquo;ve been reading other leadership blogs looking for timely advice. Tips to help all leaders in business, but with particular relevance to our customer insight leader readership.</p><h3> Developing your self-discipline <br/>  </h3><p> The first one to strike me, was this post from a favourite blogger of mine, Michael Hyatt. Michael offers a wealth of good advice for leaders on his &lsquo;virtual mentor&rsquo; blog. In this particular post he addresses what can be a perennial challenge for those seeking to lead. How do you maintain your commitment? How do you stay disciplined enough to do the work, lead the team, inspire internal stakeholders &mdash; when you don&rsquo;t feel like it? Some good tips here about the importance of reconnecting with your &lsquo;why&rsquo;.</p><p> Hopefully that gave you at least 1 tip that you can put into action. All leaders struggle with their self-discipline sometimes. But what about motivating your customer insight team. How do you go beyond self-motivation, to motivate your analysts?</p><h3> Learning from behavioural science, how not to motivate your team <br/>  </h3><p> I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re a natural optimist or pessimist, but I sometimes find it easier to learn from mistakes than ideal theory. What doesn&rsquo;t work, when trying to motivate your team? Have you seen the problem? Are even your star analysts failing to deliver consistently, or just seeming to not care as much? Perhaps understanding why your current approach if failing, can help you see another way.</p><p> That is the point of this article in Success magazine. Henry Albrecht (CEO of wellness technology company, Limeade) shares four reasons why common approaches to trying to motivate teams (including customer insight teams), fail.</p><p> Each of the four reasons are backed by learning from the field of behavioural science. I certainly relate to the importance of helping work feel meaningful. Helping your analysts connect with the ultimate outcome sought can work so well, compared to obsessing over just the technical work or the Powerpoint deck or the performance metrics.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Did any of those four ring true for your team? No need to beat yourself up, most of the approaches debunked have been taught as good efficient management in the past.</p><p> Of course, the problem with your downturn in team performance could just be the weather. Have you considered the role of the season?</p><h3> Chill out over the summer &amp; have fun with your team <br/>  </h3><p> Management writer, Harvey Schachter, shares this contrarian but sensible advice in business pages of Canadian newspaper The Globe &amp; Mail. Addressing head on the fact that many people emotionally feel like summer is for fun at the beach not toil in the office, he suggests some alternative remedies. We&rsquo;ve shared before on the importance of getting enough sleep. Harvey joins calls from Michael Hyatt to also prioritise the importance of a good holiday/vacation. Getting the most out of that time can make all the difference to how valuable your team members are when they return.</p><p> Beyond that idea, Harvey also shares some interesting tips from the world of football (half-time talks) and sports management (observing others). There are also some fun &amp; practical ideas at the end of this piece.</p><p> So, there you have it. I hope that sharing those has helped you.</p><p> Enjoy the sun and enjoy leading your team. Customer Insight can make such a difference to organisations, but that change rarely comes quickly. So, do learn to also enjoy the journey as a leader. Since attitude matters, feeling positive about your role will also rub off on your team. Have fun!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 14:42:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 14:42:05.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_zIYuLcg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/attitude-matters-how-do-you-act-as-a-leader-when-the-temperature-shoots-up/\", \"post_id\": \"12774\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 14:42:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 14:42:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"attitude-matters-how-do-you-act-as-a-leader-when-the-temperature-shoots-up\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12773\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6200\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/attitude-matters-how-do-you-act-leader-when-temperature-shoots.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"912\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-07-14\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469732400,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5956,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Ways to Find Talented Millennials and Attract Them to Your Firm","link":"7-ways-to-find-talented-millennials-and-attract-them-to-your-firm","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/author/nicoleanglace/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nicole Anglace </a></p><h3> &ldquo;The real hiring crisis is not that young advisors are burning out, though; they&rsquo;re not showing up in the first place. As older advisors retire, there aren&rsquo;t enough young advisors to take their place.&rdquo; &ndash; Danielle Andrus, Think Advisor <br/>  </h3><p> NextGen employees are invaluable to the industry, as the above quote illustrates.</p><p> But traditional recruiting methods might not be effective for this talent pool. Here are seven other ways you can locate NextGen talent and attract them to your firm. </p><h3> 1. Universities <br/>  </h3><p> When reaching out to universities, focus on those with well-respected business schools, those recognized as CFA Program Partners, or those that offer additional certificates.</p><p> Another source of talent can be found by tapping into the programs that have received funding through TD Ameritrade&rsquo;s NextGen Grant Program. This program encourages the development of financial planning education by providing two universities grant money each year. This effort is made to ensure that more young advisors will be able to meet the real world demands of RIA firms.</p><p> In recent years, recipients of this grant have included the University of North Texas, Temple University, The University of Georgia, and Texas A&amp;M University. However, while these institutions are great places to look, many of these programs have small graduating classes. Therefore, keeping a wide net is a necessity.</p><h3> 2. Professors <br/>  </h3><p> Building a relationship with the professors at these universities can provide your firm with access to top talent. Those students who demonstrate a deep understand of material or those who truly care about their studies are more likely to seek out their professors in office hours. As a result of your relationship with the professor, you may be exposed to some of the department&rsquo;s top talent.</p><p> Moreover, this professor will likely be willing to provide a letter of reference for the student, which gives you a more developed image for that applicant. Likewise, many planners even become adjunct professors at local universities in an effort to both ensure the development of the industry and to build relationships with the talent in the programs. </p><p> In the event that there is not a local university with a developed financial planning program, your firm may be able to help change that. For example, JNBA formed a partnership with the University of Minnesota and eventually helped the university launch its financial planning major.</p><p> Firms of any size may be able to assist with program formation. If planned properly, minimal risk for both organizations can be achieved.  By sending an available advisor or two each week to lecture, you can get their program off the ground, building a relationship with the university and gaining access to their top talent. As the university does not need to hire instructors from an alternate source, you help minimize their risk, and the potential benefit to your firm could vastly outweigh the opportunity cost of teaching some courses. </p><h3> 3. Career Centers <br/>  </h3><p> Connecting with advisers at college career centers is another way to get access to talent. Informing these individuals of openings at your firm will have a similar effect as informing professors. Moreover, through such a relationship, you may be able to list your job openings in university specific job sites. Hubs like these are often available to alumni as well as current students. Thus, your position will likely be seen not only by the youngest Millennials, but also by those do have some industry experience. In any event, it is likely that you will notice a marked increase in directed exposure for your position. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Career Fairs <br/>  </h3><p> Due to time restraints, you may find that this method will not be viable. However, if you are able, setting up a station at a local college career fair is worth the time and expenditure. The opportunities it will provide to interact with the students will not only generate interest in your firm, but it will also allow you to glean insight into a student&rsquo;s character in a less formal environment.</p><h3> 5. Employee Referrals <br/>  </h3><p> Establishing an employee referral program can be beneficial for your practice as a whole. You could save valuable time and money that would have been lost to advertising expenses, yet you are still exposed to potentially viable applicants.</p><p> Additionally, you have a representative who can communicate directly with the applicant and express why the company ought to be considered. If you design your program to reward the employee who made the referral, your employees will certainly appreciate the ability to earn some extra cash!</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 6. Internships <br/>  </h3><p> Internships are a great way to tap into the available young talent without a long term commitment. Starting an intern program at your firm will certainly expose you to several individuals whom you may want to bring on as full-time employees, but it will also allow you to turn away individuals who lack the necessary skills for your firm.</p><p> Certainly, great success can come from human capital investments. As of October 2015, JNBA Financial Advisors in Minneapolis had a team of 24. 13 of these advisers are Millennials, 9 of whom were hired through their well-developed internship program.</p><h3> 7. Alternative options <br/>  </h3><p> If your firm is wary and doesn&rsquo;t feel that reaching out to colleges is a viable option, consider looking into the residency programs made available by recruiting services such as Advisors Ahead. According to Investment News, firms pay Advisors Ahead when they hire one of its young professionals, most of whom are new graduates, and Advisors Ahead provides their talent with salaries and helps with licensing. </p><p> According to the CEO of Advisors Ahead, most of the candidates are hired full-time by the firms that they worked with. Thus, it would appear that this talent pipeline can be very useful for a firm that is looking to tap into the next generation of advisors.</p><p> Another way to tap into the talent is by utilizing industry job boards. Financial Planning Association, The National Association  of Personal Financial Advisors, and TD Ameritrade&rsquo;s &ldquo;RIA NextGen Career Exchange&rdquo; all provide a platform for an exchange, allowing the posting of both openings and resumes to facilitate the advancement of the industry.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 14:44:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 14:44:58.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_y8WbfFh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-ways-to-find-talented-millennials-and-attract-them-to-your-firm/\", \"post_id\": \"12776\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 14:44:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 14:44:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-ways-to-find-talented-millennials-and-attract-them-to-your-firm\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12775\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6201\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/7-ways-find-talented-millennials-and-attract-them-your-firm.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"576\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-07-14\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469696400,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5957,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Ways to Control Your Emotions and Have a Great Day","link":"5-ways-to-control-your-emotions-and-have-a-great-day","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It is difficult to look the victim of a crime in the face and not feel anger toward the person who caused the pain. But as federal law enforcement, FBI agents are required to control their emotions as they conduct investigations in a fair and efficient manner.</p><p> \"When we let our emotions take control, we become a victim of our circumstances, \"&mdash; LaRae Quy</p><p> Mental toughness is managing our emotions, thoughts, and behavior in ways that set us up for success. Emotions and thinking are linked, but we are not slaves to our emotions if we can learn how to control them.</p><h3> Here are 5 ways to control your emotions&mdash;and have a great day, all backed by research: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. LOOK INTO YOUR FUTURE <br/>  </h3><p> After a long week all I wanted to do was sit, relax, and read. When a friend called and suggested we go for a rigorous hike. I hesitated. Which situation would benefit me the most?</p><p> When we have the luxury of choosing one situation over another, we have power over the emotional outcome of our day. So how do we make the right choice on how to spend it?</p><p> Psychologists have found that people who are emotionally competent (possessing the ability to recognize and control emotions) tend to choose those situations which are most beneficial to them, regardless of whether or not it provided the most pleasure.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> Don&rsquo;t let the pursuit of happiness lead you to make decisions that are based purely on fleeting emotional experiences. Instead, look into your future and make decisions that are grounded in a clear vision of long-term goals.</p><p> For example, I chose to go for the rigorous hike because physical exercise keeps both the mind and body active, even though spending time on the couch with a book felt the most appealing.</p><h3> 2. MODIFY YOUR SITUATION <br/>  </h3><p> I was early for a supervisor&rsquo;s conference and took a seat; then Earl showed up and sat down beside me. I found Earl irksome since he was the kind of guy always making snide remarks while other people talked. I decided to modify my situation&mdash;I got up, excused myself, and left the room. After chatting with people in the hallway for five minutes, I came back in. Sure enough, someone else had taken my seat next to Earl and I found another one across the room.</p><p> Sometimes getting out of a negative situation is harder than simply moving seats. Some events like losing your job, the death of a partner, or an unexpected illness are not controllable. However, no matter the stressful situation, look for ways you can be proactive and take interventional measures.</p><p> Recent research suggests that people who do not take steps to modify their situation only compound their problems. If they learn how to reframe their circumstances, they are better able to control their emotions.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> If the situation is uncontrollable, take proactive measures such as exploring new opportunities and options that might not have been available to you before. If the situation is controllable, find ways to modify it&mdash;before your emotions spill out and make matters worse.</p><p> Either way, take action.</p><h3> 3. CONCENTRATE&mdash;OR DIVERT&mdash;YOUR ATTENTION <br/>  </h3><p> A female agent, whom I will Lucy because she was always a little loose with the facts, was giving her presentation during a squad briefing. I felt a growing resentment with each word she said because the supervisor couldn&rsquo;t see through her line of bullsh*t.</p><p> She was exaggerating the facts to make herself look good so I chose to concentrate my attention squarely on Lucy, primarily because I wanted to be very clear on where she was slipping up and giving false information.</p><p> Research by Gal Sheppes suggests that when we&rsquo;re in an uncontrollable situation the best way to deal with negative emotions is to either concentrate on what is in front of us, or divert our attention.</p><p> In his studies, he found that most people preferred to divert their attention and think of something completely different when faced with a negative emotion. Since sad and distressing situations can be very exhausting, avoidance and self-distraction can be very helpful.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> Forget traditional thinking where we&rsquo;re told that finding meaning in bad experiences is a healthy strategy while distraction and disengagement are not healthy and maladaptive. Instead, scientists are now saying that choosing the right coping strategy for the right circumstances is the key to mental health. Sometimes it&rsquo;s logical to disengage emotionally, but in other contexts it may be harmful. The key is knowing which is which.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. TACKLE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS <br/>  </h3><p> Knowing that the person I was arresting was responsible for the agony and heartache of others made it difficult to treat the suspect with the respect and dignity required by law.</p><p> Instead of turning away from disturbing or unfavorable situations, mentally tough people tackle thoughts that lead to their negative emotional response. Studies have found that people can cope with unwanted emotions by &ldquo;distancing&rdquo; themselves or imagining the situation as an impartial observer.</p><p> When you imagine an event as though you&rsquo;re a bystander, you will notice that you harbor fewer aggressive and negative emotions than if you relive the incident.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> Instead of asking, &ldquo;Why do I feel that way?&rdquo; I recommend you put the question in the third person: &ldquo;Why does LaRae feel this way?&rdquo; In this way, you can visualize yourself as a mere witness to events.</p><h3> 5. LET IT LOOSE <br/>  </h3><p> One of my interviews was a pedophile who had abused his daughter. Since I needed his cooperation, I smiled, kept my face a mask, and acted unfazed by his confession.</p><p> I was repulsed by the man and had to work hard to keep my feelings from showing. Afterwards, I went for a run and took a long shower&mdash;even the smell of him made me nauseous.</p><p> Like me, most people try to suppress negative physical reactions when they are angry, frustrated, or disgusted by the situation. Studies by psychologist Roy Baumeister explain why inhibiting expressions of stress actually leads to exhaustion and is linked to health problems.

{"original_id":5958,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Thought Leadership Marketing Can Generate Referrals for Your Firm","link":"how-thought-leadership-marketing-can-generate-referrals-for-your-firm","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/author/sylvia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sylvia Montgomery </a></p><h3> Is your AEC firm interested in selling its services? Or is it looking to solve clients&rsquo; biggest problems? <br/>  </h3><p> If you answered the latter, then you understand that knowing your clients&rsquo; perspective is critical in building a reputation that generates referrals. In fact, our research indicates that a significant number of referrals are driven by a company&rsquo;s general reputation. And arguably the most effectively way to boost your reputation is through thought leadership marketing.</p><p> Thought leaders are seen as experts in their industry. They are recognized authorities that can answer the big questions within their niche. These firms aren&rsquo;t simply selling services, but creating solutions&mdash;and in doing so, gaining a significant competitive advantage.</p><p> Displays of thought leadership can play a key role in generating referrals. In fact, according to our research on referral marketing, 81.5 percent of firms receive referrals from people they have not worked with directly. These referrals aren&rsquo;t made in the dark. They are based on experiences of your firm other than a direct vendor or client relationship.</p><h3> How Your Visible Expertise Drives Referrals <br/>  </h3><p> Our research indicates that many brand-based referrals are driven by industry expertise. So what drives expertise-based referrals?</p><p> A recent survey we conducted of 523 professional services firms found that most of these referrals come from experts who have shared their knowledge with the public. Here are the most common places prospects are exposed to this kind of expertise:</p><li> Speaking engagements (30 percent of respondents).</li><li> Blog posts and articles (20 percent of respondents).</li><li> Social media engagement (17 percent of respondents).</li><li> Books (15 percent of respondents).</li><p> One takeaway is to encourage experts at your firm to solicit speaking engagements at leading industry functions. That&rsquo;s a great long-term strategy, but one that can take time, especially if your experts don&rsquo;t already have a portfolio of speaking experience. Blogging, however, can be put into place sooner and put you on the fast track to thought leadership success. Both of these approaches can be important components of an overall content strategy.</p><h3> 3 Well-Executed Examples of Thought Leadership <br/>  </h3><p> Not sure where to get started with your thought leadership marketing? Each of the following design firms is an industry leader. Each freely dispenses its knowledge in a blog that supports the firm&rsquo;s position as an industry expert.</p><h3> 1. Array Architects <br/>  </h3><p> Array Architects is one of the country&rsquo;s leaders in the design of healthcare facilities. The firm says it offers a full complement of knowledge-based services including planning, architecture, interior design and advisory services from its seven office locations. The firm describes itself as a team of architects and designers who share a strong desire to use their expertise and knowledge to design solutions &ldquo;that will help people in moments that matter most.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> On its website, the firm doesn&rsquo;t simply promote a blog or news forum&mdash;it has created a knowledge community. Here site visitors will find a blog, the firm&rsquo;s latest tweets and a place to subscribe to new articles. Describing this forum as a community immediately sets the firm&rsquo;s social marketing apart from competitors. This becomes a place for discussion, where visitors can respond to tweets or reach out directly to partners. The firm also promotes design books, case studies, videos, webinars and podcasts&mdash;examples of thought leadership marketing that can engage any potential client.</p><h3> 2. Arup  <br/>  </h3><p> Arup is a design and consulting firm that covers a wide range of markets with its services. The company describes itself as an independent firm of designers, planners, engineers, consultants and technical specialists offering a broad range of professional services. Its self-described goal is to make a positive difference in the world through its work. That may sound like a grand claim, but Arup backs it up with a global reputation and hundreds of examples on its blog that describe how team members contribute to this goal.</p><p> In addition to displaying company news and projects on its homepage, visitors can also find there a number of examples of thought leadership, including publications, videos and a blog broadly labeled as &ldquo;Thoughts.&rdquo; On the blog, readers can learn more about the individuals who make up Arup as they share their thoughts on the themes of cities, connectivity, health and resources. Not only do these thoughts demonstrate the range of services the company offers, but it exemplifies how design and engineering truly can make the world a better place.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 3. Freeman White  <br/>  </h3><p> Freeman White is a design and consulting firm focused on solving complex healthcare facility issues. In fact, the company shares example of its work providing design, engineering, improvement and planning services for many types of healthcare buildings in case studies labeled as &ldquo;outcomes.&rdquo; The company positions itself as a solution finder, establishing its competitive advantage.</p><p> Its thought leadership section, called Insights, includes articles published in leading industry magazines, as well as on its own blog. Like its outcomes, the blog aims to answer specific questions and demonstrate to readers the firm&rsquo;s strength at solving problems. Whether it&rsquo;s determining the least expensive way to solve chiller issues or how to improve operating room efficiency, the firm demonstrates that it is a knowledgeable resource where healthcare facilities can turn for expert advice.</p><h3> Creating a Multi-Pronged Approach for Demonstrating Expertise <br/>  </h3><p> Each of these three firms also exhibits thought leadership beyond their websites. Each contributes to leading industry publications and encourages members to speak at industry events, among other displays of visible expertise. Combined, these examples of thought leadership marketing give these firms a strong competitive advantage in landing new clients and projects.</p><p> Not sure where to get started? It may be simpler than you think. Each of the firms mentioned above have enhanced their reputations by creating valuable educational content. The lesson is clear: you don&rsquo;t have to be something you aren&rsquo;t. Just focus on what you already know.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 14:48:55.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 14:48:55.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_axyaqOx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-thought-leadership-marketing-can-generate-referrals-for-your-firm/\", \"post_id\": \"12780\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 14:48:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 14:48:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-thought-leadership-marketing-can-generate-referrals-for-your-firm\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12779\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6203\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-thought-leadership-marketing-can-generate-referrals-your-firm.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"783\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-07-14\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469700000,"author_id":300,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5959,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Distractions Are Dangerous - Just Take a Look at Pokémon Go","link":"distractions-are-dangerous-just-take-a-look-at-pokemon-go","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I'm going into this post knowing I'm unpopular, but with more than 40 years on this planet, I've become very comfortable with the uncomfortable. So here we go... <br/>  </h3><p> There is an innate danger with distraction. In the most basic of survival needs, we will distract an animal to hunt it. We need to eat. As animals move up the intelligence chain, they learn to do this with other animals so they can hunt them too. Distraction means we can only focus closely on one thing at a time and with that leaves areas of vulnerability. Again, this is in the simplest of ideas. <br/> <br/> Distraction has become more complicated with time though. When we added drink holders to cars, for example, this meant we were going to have something in one hand while the driver held the wheel with the other. There is report after report which shows one-handed drivers are not safer than two-handed drivers. Doesn't matter though, the drink holders persisted and we just kept adding more distractions to the vehicles over the years (radios, moon roofs, cigarette holders, etc.). Deaths have gone up too with distracted driving - in fact, there are now more deaths from distracted driving than drunk driving. <br/> <br/> Fact: Mobile devices are distractions. Hey - I love my cellphone and if you tried to take it from me, it would be a fight! I'm not giving up my connection to the rest of the world and I certainly do not support anything which says we should do away with them. But...they are distractions:</p><li> <a href=\"http://time.com/4257429/selfie-deaths/\" target=\"_blank\">  Time magazine has a list </a>  of times people have died taking a selfie</li><li> Texting while driving  <a href=\"http://safety.trw.com/texting-while-driving-now-leading-cause-of-us-teen-deaths/0710/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  kills more than 3,000 teens </a>  per year.</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/uk/192488-children-vulnerable-sexual-predators/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sexual predators can use location services  </a> to hunt new child victims</li><p> ...and now we have Pokemon Go. I live just five miles from O'Fallon, Missouri where four teens between 16 and 18 lured a Pokemon Go user to rob him at gunpoint. The Pokemon Go user was so distracted on collecting his virtual creature, he wasn't paying attention that he had wandered into a trap. I believe strongly had the person not been distracted, they would have been able to sense, \"I shouldn't go in there.\" Instead, he succumbed to the distraction of the game. He's probably lucky to be alive.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> I had a close friend on Facebook mention he almost hit a teenager who ran between cars at a Target parking lot, completely distracted in trying to capture his creature that he didn't see my friend until they slammed their brakes on. Who would have been in trouble for hitting a child though? Likely the driver - who thankfully was not distracted.  <br/> <br/> Be smart about distractions. That's all I\"m asking. Personally, I'm not in favor of this application for a variety of reasons. Outside of the obvious distractions, they are causing across communities, it's just another thing to keep people's eye fixated to their phone and not each other.  <br/> <br/> I'm opening Pandora's Box of witchy comments. I expect to see:</p><li> Do you know how many steps I got in this week because of it? </li><li> I spent the whole afternoon with my child because of this app!</li><li> Can't you have a little fun?</li><p> Unfortunately, the amount of exposure this application puts so many young people in today is nothing to shrug off. I want to only remind that distractions are dangerous - be careful in how you use this game and any other distractions which could put you in harm's way. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 14:51:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 14:51:01.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_P243lkq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/distractions-are-dangerous-just-take-a-look-at-pokemon-go/\", \"post_id\": \"12782\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 14:51:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 14:51:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"distractions-are-dangerous-just-take-a-look-at-pokemon-go\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12781\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6204\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/distractions-are-dangerous-just-take-look-pok-mon-go.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"613\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-07-14\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469728800,"author_id":441,"chart_url":""}

Two months later he is rushed to the hospital and into the operating room for an emergency appendectomy. His mother calls the hospital in a panic and asks to know what is happening with her son. The hospital says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; I cannot give you that information.&rdquo; She says &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m his mother!&rdquo; The response: &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. For all of our adult patients, we can only give information to those authorized to receive it, and you are not authorized.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve educated your clients on the need for a Power of Attorney for Healthcare (aka healthcare proxy) for themselves, listing who can make their medical treatment decisions if they are unconscious or incapable of making those decisions. Clients may also be aware that HIPAA forms, which they regularly fill out at the doctor&rsquo;s office when they have appointments, detail who can have access to their medical records.What most clients don&rsquo;t realize is that their kids need to have these documents in place as soon as they turn 18. Then they are legal adults, and no one gets access to their medical records or treatment information without express permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To avoid nightmare scenarios, take the following steps:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ensure all of your clients complete the Power of Attorney for Healthcare, listing a trusted person and at least one alternate in case the designee cannot serve. Also remind them that when they update their HIPAA forms with their doctors, they need to include those same trusted people and perhaps other family members as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep track of clients&rsquo; children as they age. Offer to start educating the children about financial matters as soon as they are old enough, so that over time they learn about building a budget, the value of compound interest, the cost of long-term debt like a mortgage or lengthy car payment plan, the benefits of regular savings, and the realities of paying for college. Then, as soon as they turn 18, make sure the now-adult children have a Power of Attorney for Healthcare, hopefully naming the parents as their healthcare proxies, and that they fill out the HIPAA forms at their doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When an adult child goes to college, recommend that parents ensure the child fills out a HIPAA form at the Student Health Service and at the hospital in the town, listing the parents and perhaps other trusted family members as people who can have access to medical records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the aforementioned young man had these documents in place, his panicked mother would have been given full access to his medical records and the details of his situation. She would also have had the right to make treatment decisions on his behalf while he was unconscious and unable to make them himself.Especially given the state of our healthcare system, your clients and their family members need to take control of assuring who has access to medical information and the right to make treatment decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing these areas with your clients helps you protect them and also extends your reach into the next generation. Any client who encounters such a situation will be forever grateful for your wise and prescient guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advisorpedia.com/viewpoints/banishing-the-big-white-elephant-when-a-client-is-grieving\">Banishing the Big White Elephant When a Client is Grieving</a></p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 17:27:06.000000","last_updated":"2024-05-29 22:55:20.323102","image_url":"2016/7/college-bound-kids-dont-forget-to-fill-out-a-vital-medical-form-once-they-turn-18.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":"","white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"<p>Addressing these areas with your clients helps you protect them and also extends your reach into the next generation.</p>","placefilter":0,"rss_include":0,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/?p=13048\", \"post_id\": \"13048\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 10:27:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 17:27:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"college-bound-kids-dont-forget-to-fill-out-a-vital-medical-form-once-they-turn-18\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"13047\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6326\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Dont-Forget-to-Fill-Out-a-Vital-Medical-Form-Once-They-Turn-18.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"923\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-08-08\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":37626,"author_id":24,"chart_url":""}

The audience nods their heads in approval and cheers.  At the end someone says, &ldquo;Wow, that was quite persuasive.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  The only problem is: &ldquo;It just ain&rsquo;t so.&rdquo; </strong></h3>Unfortunately, especially during a political year like this one, &ldquo;just ain&rsquo;t so&rdquo; happens a little too often.Mark Twain is widely reported to have said, &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t what you don&rsquo;t know that gets you into trouble, it is what you know for sure that just ain&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;<h3> <strong>  Why do I mention this and then write the words &ldquo;widely reported&rsquo;? </strong></h3>Well, according to research done in the U.S. Library of Congress&rsquo; book<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Respectfully_Quoted.html?id=qlIYAAAAIAAJ&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"> Respectfully Quoted</a>, Twain saying this &ldquo;just ain&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;As<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/12/nigel-rees-misquotes-opinions-rees.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Forbes</a>and<a href=\"http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/05/30/better-know/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> others</a>have reported, the phrase should be attributed to a Josh Billings book called<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=SGo7AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Everybody's+Friend,+or;+Josh+Billing's+Encylopedia+and+Proverbial+Philosophy+of+Wit+and+Humor&amp;dq=Everybody's+Friend,+or;+Josh+Billing's+Encylopedia+and+Proverbial+Philosophy+of+Wit+and+Humor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=\" target=\"_blank\"> Everybody&rsquo;s Friend</a>from 1874.In saying this, I am not trying point fingers at anyone and I&rsquo;m certainly not knocking Mr. Twain.Humans are hardwired to anchor on repetition and comments from prominent members of the community, and Nobel prizes have been won for research on what is called the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect\" target=\"_blank\"> Halo Effect</a>and<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\" target=\"_blank\"> Availability Bias</a>.Our behavioral tendencies are very helpful when it comes to things like children following the advice of their parents and, as an example, not touching a hot stove when they are told repeatedly it will hurt.##TRENDING##When we&rsquo;re acting as consumers, however, it&rsquo;s important to remember that marketing and sales professionals are well-versed in taking advantage of these biases.Of course, most advertising and political copy is not intentionally false.  But we can&rsquo;t be reminded often enough that, when making an important decision, it is often prudent to &ldquo;trust but verify.&rdquo;A recent article in the Wall Street Journal might serve as a good example.The story was well-written and quite memorable, focusing on what is reported to be an impressive, long-term investment track record that &ldquo;wins clients&rdquo; and &ldquo;instills confidence&rdquo;.<h3> <strong>  What was the problem? </strong></h3>According to the manager&rsquo;s own website, over the past 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 years, he has underperformed his declared investment benchmark for every single period, which is not that impressive and doesn&rsquo;t instill confidence.  As an example, after fees, he has lagged his index by approximately 5.5% per year for the past 5-years*.I am leaving out links to the article on purpose and not mentioning the manager because my point is not to call out a specific manager or the journalist writing about him.Instead, my point is that investors and voters alike should simply be aware and consider a little fact checking of pervasive articles, speeches and presentations.Before voting this fall, consider visiting the Pulitzer Prize winning fact checking website<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Politifact</a>.

{"original_id":5963,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Have You Been Hit-On While Networking? 6 Ways To Politely Decline","link":"have-you-been-hit-on-while-networking-6-ways-to-politely-decline","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Women of the business world: There&rsquo;s a type of awkward male/female interaction in the network setting that has likely taken many of you by surprise, but rarely gets discussed with or addressed by your colleagues and supervisors.</p><p> It can&rsquo;t be categorized as sexual harassment, yet it&rsquo;s not entirely appropriate to engage in, nor does it typically feel welcomed. I&rsquo;m referring to the male-initiated suggestive inquiry, or in plainer language, getting hit-on. Has a man ever made an unexpected pass at you during a networking event? If your answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, it turns out you&rsquo;re not alone, as more women than I&rsquo;d ever have imagined can lay claim to a similar experience.</p><p> SO, you find yourself in the midst of a suggestive pass from a businessman whom you had hoped to do business with. What happens next? Well, there are many forms this pass can take, and the answer can vary depending upon your individual experience, which can range from innocent to charming to downright creepy.</p><h3> Let me offer a few thoughts on the subject, designed to help ensure that you respond (not react) when the inevitable happens, and possibly even turn this awkward interaction around to work in your best business interest. <br/>  </h3><h3> Heading Him Off At The Pass <br/>  </h3><p> If you find that you&rsquo;re the type who gets hit-on often, consider a proactive approach in the business networking setting each time you engage with a man. During the &lsquo;getting to know you&rsquo; part of the conversation, be sure to mention your kids, husband or boyfriend, and then ask about his family. This not only serves as an important news flash that will deter a prospective suitor, but you will be sharing personal commonalities to help you connect with this person in the future.</p><h3> Breathe <br/>  </h3><p> When a pass is initially made toward you, a couple of physical and mental breaths will seem perfectly natural from the man&rsquo;s perspective, and will give you the opportunity to collect your thoughts before you respond. This can deter an amygdala hijackand prevent you from saying something you might regret later. As a matter of fact, Olivia Fox Cabane suggests that this kind of timing adds to your charisma, and serves to strengthen your business relationship with the person once the suggestive proposition is squashed.</p><h3> Joke About It <br/>  </h3><p> Your rejection to the man&rsquo;s pursuit doesn&rsquo;t have to be so painfully dry. Arm yourself with the ultimate disarming weapon: Humor. When the moment arrives, you&rsquo;ll be ready to respond off-the-cuff. &ldquo;My husband may not be terribly cooperative here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be forewarned that my boyfriend is an axe murderer.&rdquo; Once again, the mere mention of your spouse can be an effective defuser.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> The Soft Letdown <br/>  </h3><p> Sometimes an old high school standard can still work wonders in the adult business setting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered, but I&rsquo;m spoken for&rdquo; may just be the way to go, particularly if you can get a good read on the man, and you&rsquo;re confident that he&rsquo;s not aggressive in his pursuit. If you&rsquo;re single but are still not interested, go with the firmer yet decidedly respectful &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, but I don&rsquo;t mix business with pleasure.&rdquo;</p><h3> For The Aggressive Ones <br/>  </h3><p> If the flattery continues, consistently steering the conversation away from business, it might be time to puff yourself up like a territorial bird. You might hear something like &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the prettiest one in the room&rdquo;. Your prompt and direct reply can be &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m the smartest and most qualified as well&rdquo;. Such a sassy response communicates that you&rsquo;re a strong woman, which can tame or even intimidate some men with macho facades.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> On Keeping The Relationship Professional <br/>  </h3><p> Once you&rsquo;ve averted the unwelcomed advances of the interested party, and you&rsquo;ve managed to preserve the business end of the relationship, there are a few tips for moving forward warmly without inadvertently sending him the wrong message (i.e.: to not seem like you&rsquo;re in compliance with his initial advances, or worse, seem like you&rsquo;re hitting on him).</p><p> For instance, when you plan a business meal with him, suggest a lunch meeting instead of dinner. Lunch is far less likely to be interpreted as a potentially romantic date. While you&rsquo;re at it, make the reservations for 4 and invite some strategic colleagues. Does the company you work for employ the custom of baseball game tickets for courting clients? Use the same approach as with the lunch reservations and request some extra tickets so that other trusted colleagues can be present!</p><p> There&rsquo;s a fine line between networking in a professional environment and building friendships. Since we women have traditionally been in the minority in the networking setting, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we should be at a disadvantage. By creating your own mental boundaries before heading in, you&rsquo;re prepared to maximize the experience and perhaps even take advantage of your unique position.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 14:53:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 14:53:03.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_jRouQRk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/have-you-been-hit-on-while-networking-6-ways-to-politely-decline/\", \"post_id\": \"12784\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 14:53:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 14:53:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"have-you-been-hit-on-while-networking-6-ways-to-politely-decline\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12783\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6205\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/have-you-been-hit-while-networking-6-ways-politely-decline.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"623\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"289\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469718000,"author_id":135,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5964,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Critical Steps to Build Permanent Stress Resilience Against Market Volatility","link":"critical-steps-to-build-permanent-stress-resilience-against-market-volatility","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The market upheaval of late has many advisors juggling with potential stressors, including dealing with demanding and impatient clients, worrying about this market turbulence lasting for a long time, and re-considering their core values in order to try to take advantage of the current market conditions.</p><p> Advisors who consult with me for help, complain about symptoms such as insomnia, irritability (which puts strain on their home as well as office relationships), increased alcohol intake, and an overall inability being able to relax.  They find themselves dreading Sunday evenings (anticipating another Monday morning market upheaval) and longing for Fridays, as a break from the market roller coaster, the phone calls and mandatory explanations to their clients.</p><h3> Here are 7 critical steps to build permanent stress resilience, despite the markets, economy, etc.  <br/>  </h3><p> These are all strongly research-based neuroscience concepts (see John Arden, &ldquo;Brain2Brain,&rdquo; 2015).  Even if you have never engaged in even one of these critical steps, we now know from the emerging science of Neuroplasticity that you can quickly re-wire your brain in very positive ways by conscientiously practicing these skills.</p><h3> Step 1: Take Charge Of Your Diet <br/>  </h3><p> Yes, you read it correctly.  Your diet has a lot to do with your resiliency to stress. The old adage of starting the day with a healthy breakfast is true.  It is necessary for problem solving, working memory, attention, concentration and energy.</p><p> Skipping breakfast (a common habit of stressed advisors) contributes difficulties in all of the above, plus it leads to mood swings, depression, and anxiety.</p><p> Because so many of us tend to overeat or eat quickly satisfying food when we are stressed, it is critical to keep control of your diet by eating fewer calories, and eating smart.  If this is an issue for you, consult a registered dietician.</p><p> 20% of our brains is made up of essentially fatty acids.  This is why the international recommendation of consuming 650 mg. essentially fatty acids daily is important, and the average American consumes only about 130 mg. daily.  Omega 3 fatty acids are a really healthy option.</p><p> Good hydration is another habit that advisors frequently ignore as they are consumed with their computers and phones. Poor hydration is related to impaired mood, including depression and anxiety, and impaired cognition, including attention and forgetfulness.  Consuming alcohol (at lunch, for example), contributes to dehydration.</p><h3> Step 2: Take Charge Of Your Blood Sugar <br/>  </h3><p> Closely related to our diet is our blood sugar level. Diabetes 2 is rampant in the U.S. and probably under diagnosed in advisors because so many of you &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have the time&rdquo; for regular physicals, including blood work.</p><p> Unregulated intake of simple carbohydrates and trans-fatty acids, from sweets, chips, deep-fried foods, margarine, etc., can have devastating effects on mood, anxiety, etc., besides the physical effects on our bodies, including elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels.</p><p> But, low blood sugar is also a problem. Skipping meals, for example, can lead to low blood sugar.  When blood sugar drops below 50 mg. per ml. symptoms include:</p><li> free floating anxiety</li><li> shakiness</li><li> lightheadedness</li><li> irritability</li><li> rapid heartbeat</li><li> difficulty concentrating</li><li> memory problems</li><p> So, much of our stress resilience is connected to our diets.</p><h3> Step 3: Take Charge Of Your Sleep <br/>  </h3><p> Insomnia is a major problem among advisors. There are many causes of insomnia, which go beyond the purpose of this article.  Sadly, many people who suffer from insomnia load up on medications or alcohol in order to sleep and these substances all have side effects, including potential addiction.</p><p> Sleep deprivation not only obviously leads to fatigue, but to difficulty concentrating and impaired emotional regulation.  You can easily research the science of &ldquo;Sleep Hygiene,&rdquo; where you can discover natural ways of enhancing your sleep experience.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Step 4:  Activate Your Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) <br/>  </h3><p> Anxiety and stress issues are a function of the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS), which is activated whenever we worry or get concerned.  The SNS overreacts in order to protect us from danger, which is rarely the issue with everyday anxiety, so we are constantly in a state of heightened vigilance and concern.</p><p> This leads to heightened blood pressure, rapid breathing, difficulty concentrating and memory issues.</p><p> The relaxation system (the PNS) is activated when we are soaking in the bath, sunbathing at the beach, on a boat, etc.  This is a critical system for stress resilience, but being at the beach, etc., are relatively rare occurrences.  Here are some proven methods you can use anywhere and any time:</p><li> yoga</li><li> meditation</li><li> stretching</li><li> cuddling</li><li> Kegal exercises at your desk (look it up)</li><li> orgasm</li><h3> Step 5: Take Charge Of Your Breathing <br/>  </h3><p> Proper breathing is the fastest way to activate the PNS. Most people breath 9-16 breaths per minute. Over-breathing, which happens when we are stressed, pulls in too much oxygen and reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood stream, affecting the ph of the blood and causing anxious feelings, even panic attacks.</p><p> Slow, deep breathing through the diaphragm reverses that process and quickly activates the PNS. Here is the quickest way to do it:  Breath in through your nose to the count of 4, hold it for 4 seconds, and forcefully exhale through your mouth to the count of 7. Keep your hands folded on your stomach to make sure your stomach moves out when you inhale and comes back in when you exhale.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Step 6: Take Charge Of Your Thinking <br/>  </h3><p> All of our stress begins with our thinking habits and self-talk about the events in our lives.  The events, themselves, do not cause our stress. For example, if the market drops several hundred points, that event does not cause your stress.  Your stress is only caused by negative, self-defeating thinking and self-talk about that event.  (&ldquo;Great, now my most difficult clients will be on the phone demanding to speak to me.&rdquo;)</p><p> I have written much about breaking free of automatic thinking and stress-producing self-talk (see &ldquo;The Financial Advisor&rsquo;s Ultimate Stress Mastery Guide.&rdquo;) Suffice it to say that all of these stress-producing habits are learned and anything that is learned can be un-learned with practice.</p><h3> Step 7: Laugh As Often As Your Can <br/>  </h3><p> Humor and laughing provides a potent psychological boost, releases healthy endorphins and has been linked with resiliency building, warding off illnesses and even extending life.  If you make sure that you take the time to watch funny sitcoms and movies, read humorous articles, hang around with funny people, etc., you are really boosting your stress resilience. Other findings of the power of laughter include:</p><li> reduced anxiety and stress</li><li> lifted depression</li><li> improved cognitive functioning</li><li> decreased cortisol (stress hormone)</li><li> increases in natural cancer-killing cells in the body</li><li> longer life</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 14:55:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 14:55:17.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_UMeJq4k.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/critical-steps-to-build-permanent-stress-resilience-against-market-volatility/\", \"post_id\": \"12785\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 14:55:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 14:55:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"critical-steps-to-build-permanent-stress-resilience-against-market-volatility\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12783\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6206\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/have-you-been-hit-while-networking-6-ways-politely-decline.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"422\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"289\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469692800,"author_id":153,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5965,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Sturdy Market Volatility Plan to Prevent Market Dips From Disrupting Your Day","link":"a-sturdy-market-volatility-plan-to-prevent-market-dips-from-disrupting-your-day","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Ryan Scott</p><p> In early July, the US markets declined 2%; the largest one-day market dip in the last two years. It was Greece, this time, which left a bad taste in investors&rsquo; mouths and proved to us once again that the markets don&rsquo;t always steadily increase over time. It seemed like a bad day for investors and a bad day for advisors.  </p><p> And right now, the market volatility continues! On bad market days, advisors may be overwhelmed by their client&rsquo;s emotional responses to the market movements. How can you be pro-active and gauge the \"market mood\" of your clients? </p><h3> Below is a 4-step market volatility plan to prevent market dips from disrupting your day. <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Lay the ground work with clients on loss aversion to open up discussions: <br/>  </h3><p> We all know that people hate losses, but research originally conducted by Daniel Kahneman and more recently by the AARP quantifies this level of hate. Their research indicates that an average person is 2 times more averse to losses compared to their value of gains, and retirees are 5 times more averse to losses than their value of gains.</p><p> While this fact is interesting, the &ldquo;average&rdquo; person is never sitting across the table from an advisor. In fact, our research indicates that only 38% of people have what the AARP study describes as normal levels of risk (e.g. Group 4 of 7) and the 2:1 ratio introduced by the research can be as high as 10:1 for the most conservative investors. To zero in on the exact level of pain or pleasure shown the graph above, advisors have to objectively measure the level of loss aversion by a validated instrument. Once this level of loss aversion is uncovered, a conversation needs to be had with the client (and their spouse). The goal of this loss aversion discussion is to identify the gut reactions clients experience with losses and identify what level of exposure they can tolerate to market volatility.</p><h3> 2. Develop a Market Volatility Plan (MVP): <br/>  </h3><p> A 2% dip in the market is a fearful event for some clients, but an opportunity for others. Objectively segmenting clients into these groups allows advisors to better prepare for their discussions by knowing how the client will look at the market scenario (either with a positive or negative outlook). One solution, Market Mood, will segment clients automatically by the level of market fear and prioritize advisors&rsquo; working days. If an advisor doesn&rsquo;t have Market Mood, this could also be done manually once you have developed an understanding on the following behavioral finance principles:</p><p> a. Most clients that have more aggressive risk profiles look at small market declines with optimism, in hopes of making a return on the current market volatility. The key for advisors is to allow the client to make investment decisions rationally by appropriately presenting the risks and rewards.</p><p> b. Most clients that have conservative risk profiles make irrational decisions when they are losing money. These people require attention immediately or their emotions will get the best of them.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 3. Identify the Communication style of your clients: <br/>  </h3><p> Clients understand and retain the most information about market events when they are approached with their preferred communication and learning style. It&rsquo;s critically important that the client&rsquo;s preferred communication style is documented and available to each client-facing representative in a firm.</p><p> a. Introverted clients prefer to be contacted via email <br/> b. Extroverted clients like to meet in person <br/> c. Fast-paced clients like to get to the point with a phone call <br/> d. Patient clients like to keep discussions calm</p><h3> 4. Document and manage your client&rsquo;s behavioral biases: <br/>  </h3><p> Behavioral biases are the blind-spot of investing. When confronted with new investing situations, clients will inherently let their biases drive their decision-making processes. The key to managing your client&rsquo;s decisions in volatile markets is to first identify and document a client&rsquo;s biases and train your staff to look out for the warning signs.</p><p> I am a creative person. The struggle with people like me is that they become easily bored and have the desire to constantly &ldquo;re-invent the wheel&rdquo;. In Behavioral Finance, we call this a Newness Bias. Just like a Doctor would document someone&rsquo;s hypertension or diabetes on their medical records, advisors need to have client &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; documented. I am likely to call my advisor trying to de-rail the train from our existing plan because the market made a quick dip, having these details documented, allow the advisory staff to help steer the train back onto the tracks.</p><h3> Execute on your action items <br/>  </h3><p> Once the Market Volatility Plan is created, all you need to do is execute!</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 14:57:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 14:57:05.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_JnUgf6z.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-sturdy-market-volatility-plan-to-prevent-market-dips-from-disrupting-your-day/\", \"post_id\": \"12787\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 14:57:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 14:57:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-sturdy-market-volatility-plan-to-prevent-market-dips-from-disrupting-your-day\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12786\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6207\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sturdy-market-volatility-plan-prevent-market-dips-disrupting-your-day.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"614\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"289\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469703600,"author_id":384,"chart_url":""}

She worried about running out of money in retirement when she would be too old to work.The thought of not having enough money to live on in retirement is a fear that plagues mature women. You may have heard the term, Bag Lady Syndrome, which is the fear of becoming poor and homeless in retirement. The interesting thing about this fear is that it plagues even high income earning women (those who make $200,000+), according to an Allianz study on Women, Money and Power.However, when you look at the reality of the financial challenges women face in retirement, it&rsquo;s obvious that these fears are validated.For instance, according to a USA Today article, women account for eighty percent of those living to age one hundred. For every ten centenarians, eight of them are women. It also stated that of those men and women who do survive to age 100, women are more likely than men to be living in a nursing home.One of the top money fears women have about retirement is the inability to continue their lifestyle comfortably. The thought of having to move to a nursing home is unsettling for various reasons.One way for women to get motivated to take charge and plan for a secure retirement is to take heed and listen to what studies are telling us:<li> 62% of women whish they have saved more, and 55% wish they had begun saving earlier.</li><li> 53% of baby boomer women are concerned about out living their sources of retirement income.</li><li> For those born in 1950, life expectancy for women was 5.5 years more than for men.</li><li> 49% of women over the age of 75 live alone.</li><li> 74% of women agree that they do not know as much as they should about retirement investing.</li><li> Women are less confident that they will have enough money to live comfortably throughout retirement.</li><li> 28% of Baby boomer women don&rsquo;t think they can afford to retire.</li>Ladies, don&rsquo;t let your lack of confidence with money hold you back from taking the next step to securing your own financial wellbeing for your retirement years. You are not alone in feeling ill-equipped to handle finances. Studies show that most women feel this way.##TRENDING##Consider what the Allianz study (2013) reveals about women who take the initiative and work with a financial professional:<li> 77% felt more confident and prepared for their financial future.</li><li> 72% felt more independent and self-sufficient.</li><li> 45% were more likely to teach their kids about finances.</li>So my question to you is what&rsquo;s one thing you can do today to start creating your own retirement security?In my recent blog post, <a href=\"/grow/development/women-money-retirement-3-basic-steps-to-create-retirement-security\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Women &amp; Retirement: How to Reduce Financial Fears</a>, I share three tips and five great articles for you to start increasing your financial literacy and reduce your fears.

While it seems it is the only way to get the business there is a better way.</p><p> Getting a commitment from a potential client is not just important to the advisor, but is often a necessary step to motivating the prospect to make a decision that is good for them.  The old school approach to closing typically focuses on forcing a commitment with little to no room for clients to feel comfortable raising questions:</p><li> &ldquo;When can we get the process started? &ldquo;</li><li> &ldquo;All you need to do is sign here.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Is there any reason we can&rsquo;t get started today?&rdquo;</li><p> This traditional approach has tainted the well for so many women. With little understanding and less than stellar communication and education from advisors, many women don&rsquo;t even know what questions to ask, and often feel obligated to move forward.  </p><p> Today&rsquo;s process requires more transparency, education, and a collaborative process where both the advisor and client are truly committed to achieving their primary financial goal. This new approach focuses less on prospecting and more on building relationships because It eliminates selling and focuses on inspiring potential clients with alternative options. This new more female-friendly approach transforms closing into a process that motivates clients to do what is right for them.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> In order to make this new approach work you must learn new skills that emphasize clarity and understanding.</p><p> Closing skills can no longer be an isolated tactic but the culmination to a process that is highly collaborative and engaging.</p><li> It all starts with an understanding, understanding who the client is and an understanding as to why you as the advisor care about them.  If your market is women, then ask yourself &lsquo;Why do I care about women?&rsquo; If it&rsquo;s business owners, then ask yourself &lsquo;Why do I care so much about business owner?&rsquo;. Regardless of your focus you must be able to articulate why through your personal story. This will dramatically accelerate your ability to build a trusting relationship.</li><li> Your process must inspire prospects to want to work with you. Using language, terms and analogies that are congruent with their world by eliminating financial jargon and terminology transforms the process into one that is totally authentic and transparent. Instead of promoting a &ldquo;financial plan&rdquo; perhaps you rename it a Personal Income Plan (for women) or a Succession Plan (for business owners).

{"original_id":5968,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Transferable Business Value: Understanding The Role Of A Growth Strategy","link":"transferable-business-value-understanding-the-role-of-a-growth-strategy","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> In this series, we&rsquo;re examining the elements (or value drivers) that build transferable value: the value of a company without the owner at the helm. <br/>  </h3><p> This is the type of value buyers look and pay for. Today we consider the multi-faceted growth plan that most businesses require if owners are to sell or transfer their companies for the amount of cash they need and want for their post-business lives.</p><p> If your clients&rsquo; businesses currently have sufficient value and cash flow to yield financial security when they sell or transfer it, your focus need not be on creating growth strategies. For the vast majority of owners, however, formulating and executing a growth plan is at the core of their Exit Plans.</p><p> As Exit Planners, the growth plans we create are designed to achieve one goal: to provide the amount of cash owners will need at their exits to attain both financial security and their other objectives. Whether you call it a &ldquo;growth plan,&rdquo; a &ldquo;business plan&rdquo; or a &ldquo;budget,&rdquo; the point is that to exit on their terms&mdash;including departure date&mdash;owners need a road map that describes what needs to happen, by when, and who is going to be accountable for achieving each task.</p><p> Your timeframe to achieve the growth needed begins today and ends on your anticipated exit date.</p><p> I recently spoke with BEI member Tom Majcher of Majcher Group LLC, an investment banker, about his experience designing growth plans for owners&rsquo; Exit Plans.. &ldquo;</p><p> Tom related the following story.</p><p> &ldquo;When I began working with &lsquo;Yolanda,&rsquo; the owner of &lsquo;Company ABC,&rsquo; to create her Exit Plan, we determined that she needed a company with $20 million in annual revenue to meet her exit goals. ABC had steadily improved revenue to $8 million, but profits were decreasing.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Using $20 million in revenue as their target, Tom and Yolanda sat down to create a plan to grow revenue and profitability.</p><p> The elements of the growth plan for Company ABC included:</p><li> A management restructure. Most growth plans for established companies include some level of restructuring at the management level. In the case of ABC, Yolanda was the only &ldquo;manager&rdquo; and she had reached the limit of her ability to grow business revenue and cash flow.</li><p> &ldquo;Our first task,&rdquo; recalls Majcher, &ldquo;was to find, hire, and retain an entire management team, beginning with a well-experienced COO. Yolanda was hard-working and incredibly capable, but limited in the skills and financial resources necessary to grow the company. We created a plan to reward the new COO with significant ownership in the company provided it grew as we planned.&rdquo;</p><li> A formal, annual budget. Once the new COO was on board, Yolanda and Tom worked with him to create an annual budget that assigned responsibilities to the rest of the newly hired managers, set timelines, and projected revenue and cash flow over a seven-year time frame. In writing, the plan summarized what needed to be done, by whom and by what date using bullet points and attached pro formas.</li><li> Additional financing. With its financial ducks in a row, Yolanda and her COO were prepared to obtain the additional financing necessary to fund the anticipated growth of her capital-intensive company.</li><p> As a result, Company ABC blossomed: its management team implemented state-of-the-art systems and achieved the goals Yolanda had set for it. Five years after meeting Tom, Yolanda sold a company that had reached its revenue and cash flow objectives for cash to a private equity fund.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> Yolanda was integral to making growth of her company happen: she had built great customer and employee relationships as a foundation. But she also had the humility to know what she didn&rsquo;t have (a plan!) and to bring in Tom, a knowledgeable advisor. Yolanda was also willing to change her role in the company for the sake of growth. Without that combination of Yolanda&rsquo;s insight and Tom&rsquo;s prompting and expertise, her company would have continued to drift along and it is unlikely that she would have exited as successfully as she did.</p><p> Combining next-level management (the mother of all value drivers) with a written growth plan is, in our experience, a powerful one-two punch. With your input, owners and top management can create the plan for how a company will achieve the owner&rsquo;s goals. Without the input of experienced advisors, owners simply don&rsquo;t know who to turn to for advice on moving their company forward. As a result, their companies stagnate and their exits remain a wistful dream.</p><p> As we&rsquo;ve tried to demonstrate in this series, creating and implementing an effective Exit Plan requires the efforts of a coordinated team of advisors. When it comes to helping an owner drive business growth (or other challenges), Exit Planners take a three-step approach:</p><li> Recognize the challenge facing owners. (In this case the need to accelerate growth.)</li><li> Communicate the challenge to owners in a manner that a) puts meeting the challenge in the context of their successful exits and b) prompts them to take action.</li><li> Recommend the appropriate professional advisor. That&rsquo;s one purpose of creating your network of advisors.</li><p> As we hope Tom&rsquo;s case study illustrates, creating and implementing growth plans for your owner clients is a vital element of creating their successful exits.</p><p>  </p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 15:04:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 15:04:40.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_7euoobU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/transferable-business-value-understanding-the-role-of-a-growth-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"12793\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 15:04:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 15:04:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"transferable-business-value-understanding-the-role-of-a-growth-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12792\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6210\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/transferable-business-value-understanding-role-growth-strategy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"732\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469714400,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5970,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Shining a Bright Light on the High Costs of Breaking Away","link":"shining-a-bright-light-on-the-high-costs-of-breaking-away","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Once You Break Free of the Wirehouse, You Need to Run From the Platforms and Aggregators, Too!</h3><p> <br/> There is always a dark side to success.  The RIA market has been booming for years, consistently taking assets away from the traditional bank/wirehouse community, and now manages nearly $3 trillion in assets.</p><p> As the overall assets under management has risen in the RIA community, a slew of opportunistic middlemen have put up their shingles, offering &ldquo;platforms&rdquo; or an &ldquo;aggregator solution&rdquo; to help captive advisors break away and remove the operational aspects of the transition to independence - a truly valuable service that is needed by breakaway teams who have never had to manage these critical issues before. </p><p> The rub here is that these middlemen are using the lack of experience and knowledge of these advisors against them to extract exorbitant rents.   As a result, the high costs associated with the aggregators and platform providers is limiting and slowing down the breakaway movement, especially for the larger teams &ndash; a very unfortunate result for not only those advisors and their clients, but also the industry as a whole.</p><p> In many ways, the financial crisis of 2008 was the greatest thing to ever happen to the RIA industry.  High net worth clients began to value the open architecture, transparency, and conflict-free business models offered by independent advisors.  Once clients began asking for it, advisors began flocking in droves to the independent channel.  Most, if not all, of these advisors had never set up or run their own business before, so a cottage industry evolved helping these teams enter the independent channel.  The typical advisor thought, &ldquo;I want to go independent, but I just want to focus on my clients.  I don&rsquo;t want to worry about running my own business.&rdquo;  They were flocking to plug-and-play solutions, regardless of the cost.  They just had to get out of the shackles of the wirehouse world, and they needed to do it quickly.</p><p> Fast-forward to today: the industry has continued to evolve and billion-dollar RIAs are no longer the rare unicorns that they once were.  In California alone, there are over 40 fee-only RIAs that manage over $1 billion in assets.  RIAs have lifted their heads from their client servicing responsibilities to realize they have built real businesses!  They have started hiring dedicated managers of their businesses to handle HR, IT, Compliance, and Business Development.   They have documented business plans, with specific revenue targets and growth strategies.  These aren&rsquo;t lifestyle practices any longer, these are true sustainable business built for the future.</p><p> There is a lot at stake for a wirehouse team considering setting up their own RIA.  Following the 2008 financial crisis, it was enough to attract clients simply by saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an independent advisor conducting business under the Fiduciary Standard.&rdquo;  As previously mentioned, there is now fierce competition of real businesses competing for RIA clients.  No one wants to figure out the transition experience on their own (See &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.riabiz.com/a/5058823186284544/a-breakaway-artist-confesses-the-mistakes-he-made-in-ushering-pbigs-hou-sear-team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  A Breakaway Artist </a> Confesses the Mistakes He Made Ushering PBIG&rsquo;s Hou-Sear Team&rdquo;) -- the fear of losing clients during transition is just too high.</p><h3> Unfortunately, while the industry has evolved to become more sophisticated, the transition solutions for wirehouse advisors, particularly the billion-dollar teams, have not.</h3><p> <br/> Currently, due to the lack of alternatives, these teams meet with the legacy opportunistic platform providers/aggregators that can offer the valuable startup services such as real estate, office setup, technology, branding, website, and even &ldquo;swag&rdquo; that they need to exit their current firm.  The sales pitch they receive is that by plugging into these larger organizations, they can provide teams economies of scale where they can negotiate great pricing with the various vendors and service providers on their behalf.  Here&rsquo;s the fly in the ointment: for these services, the aggregators want a percentage of firm ownership ( <u>  bottom-line </u> earnings) and the platform providers charge expensive basis points on AUM.  </p><p> Breakaway advisors find themselves wondering where the promised value-add services are, now that they are established RIAS writing big checks every year to these middlemen.  Confirming this trend, we are now beginning to see high-profile stories of advisors who had joined the aggregator platforms, only to realize they can do better on their own, such as PagnatoKarp (See &ldquo;After chats with <a href=\"http://www.riabiz.com/a/5005917670080512/after-chats-phyllis-borzi-a-flagship-hightower-team-executes-a-deliberate-breakaway-to-form-a-25-billion-ria\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Phyllis Borzi  </u> </a> , a flagship HighTower team executes a &lsquo;deliberate&rsquo; breakaway to for a $2.5-billion RIA&rdquo;</p><p> As an example, consider a $2 billion team with $15 million in revenue and $10 million of bottom-line earnings.  If an aggregator wants 50% equity for their services, that would cost this team $5 million per year, in perpetuity.  If a platform provider wants to charge 5 bps for their services, that will cost this team $1 million per year for the length of the contract. </p><p> These teams sit back and realize, &ldquo;With $2 billion of AUM, I can get great pricing on IT, Compliance, and Custody all on my own.  I don&rsquo;t need a long-term relationship, I really just need help setting up my RIA and transitioning clients.  This long-term contract seems awfully expensive just for transition services!&rdquo; </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> When running the numbers, teams realize that it is not economical to make the move to an expensive aggregator or platform provider solution, and as a result, end up staying with their wirehouse firm &ndash; a suboptimal outcome not only for their clients, but also for themselves and the industry as a whole.</p><p> For the truly entrepreneurial advisors, they realize very quickly that the equity and/or AUM pricing eliminates operating leverage &ndash; something they are trying to achieve by going independent.  Operating leverage is a simple, yet powerful business concept where every dollar of additional revenue is more profitable than the last, because operating expenses don&rsquo;t grow at the same rate as revenue.  In the wirehouse world, an advisor&rsquo;s payout percentage doesn&rsquo;t change once they top out on the production grid, resulting in no operating leverage. </p><p> RIAs, however, enjoy economies of scale and own 100% of their revenues, and <u>  do </u> gain leverage from each incremental revenue dollar.  That is, unless they&rsquo;ve sold a percentage of bottom-line earnings, or have agreed to pay a fixed rate based on AUM.  In those scenarios, the payment to these service providers continues to rise as earnings and/or AUM increase, effectively wiping out precious operating leverage.</p><p> What billion-dollar teams need today to transition out of the wirehouse world and start their own RIA is to use their inherent economies of scale to obtain the resources and preferred pricing promised by the platforms and aggregators. </p><p> To get up and running, teams only need to work with experienced consultants who operate on a fee-based, project basis for the RIA business&rsquo; startup needs (full disclosure:  I am the Founder &amp; CEO of one of these firms, PFI Advisors).  Once the clients have transitioned out of the wirehouse and the RIA infrastructure is in place, advisors quickly realize that they are a self-contained business, easily capable of handling the day-to-day operations of their own firm.</p><p> There is no need to pay for these services through the aggregators or platform providers by giving up valuable equity or paying steep ongoing basis points on a multi-year contract.  Rather, by tapping into the deep expertise and knowledge of industry transition experts &ndash; those that are independent and not tied to a specific platform &ndash; advisors can achieve a quick start up with the latest transition needs.</p><p> Teams can pursue their RIA dreams in confidence, knowing that they have the right advice and support to build their dream firm the right way, without having to give up a significant portion of their firm.</p><p> This article is based upon a recent white paper, &ldquo;Pursuing the RIA Dream: New Transition Models for Billion-Dollar Breakaway Advisor Teams.&rdquo; To obtain a copy, click <a href=\"http://pfiadvisors.com/pfi-advisors-inaugural-white-paper-new-transition-models-for-billion-dollar-breakaway-teams/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> .</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 15:40:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 15:40:09.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_zBFg7ln.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/shining-a-bright-light-on-the-high-costs-of-breaking-away/\", \"post_id\": \"12796\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 15:40:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 15:40:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"shining-a-bright-light-on-the-high-costs-of-breaking-away\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12797\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6212\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/shining-bright-light-high-costs-breaking-away.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1878\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469727000,"author_id":333,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5971,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How One Financial Planner Saves for Retirement","link":"how-one-financial-planner-saves-for-retirement","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My name is Damon Gonzalez.  I am 38 years old and if everything goes as planned, I will be financially independent in the next two to five years.  I fortunately love my job and hope to work into old age.  Financial pundits make forecasts and try tell you what stock they think you need to own for the next quarter, but have you ever wondered what they actually do with their own money?  Although I am a little uncomfortable sharing, I thought it would be refreshing to share how my wife and I have planned for our own retirement.</p><h3> Invest in Yourself</h3><p> <br/> All honest work is valuable, but it is hard to build wealth on a meager income.  Every once in awhile you will read a story about a <a href=\"http://www.nathanielturner.com/oseolamccarty.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  cleaning woman </a> who gave a substantial amount of money to charity, or a <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/17/13921601-7-million-in-gold-found-in-dead-nevada-mans-home?lite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  man who died with $7 million worth of gold </a> in his $100,000 house.  These stories fascinate us because they are so rare and unexpected.  There are ways to build a successful retirement on almost any income, but having a higher income obviously helps a lot.</p><p> If you want to build wealth, your best investment is being the best you that you can be.  That means getting enough sleep, eating well, not abusing drugs and alcohol, and working hard.  An education (not just going to school) that allows you to become a professional or start your own business is probably the best money and time you will ever spend. Don&rsquo;t shy away from investing in yourself.</p><p> My wife worked very hard to get a masters degree in tax and slaved long hours to work her way up at a Big 4 accounting firm.  Later in life, she transferred the skills she&rsquo;d picked up from accounting and the relationships she made along the way into a career as a recruiter.</p><p> I started out as a financial advisor when I was 22 and had no idea how hard it would be to build a business from the ground up.  For the first few years, while my friends were going out and having fun, I was cold calling and working five and a half days a week.  My manager even made me work extra hours so I could take a weekend off to be in a friend&rsquo;s wedding. In addition to the long hours I was logging at work, I used my free time to study for a Certified Financial Planner&trade; designation.  To this day, I take classes at the community college and read dry academic books about investing and financial planning on the weekends to keep my skills sharp in this very competitive world.</p><p> I strongly believe that an investment of time and money into building your skills is the most important part of a financial plan.</p><h3> Take Care of the Downside</h3><p> <br/> Bad things often happen to good people.  You never know if you are going to get sick or hurt or what accident is waiting around the bend.  Having a cash reserve is the second step in creating a sound financial plan.  It seems like an unexpected emergency comes up every year.  You may not be able to predict what will happen, but factoring the probability of something happening is important and can save you a lot of money, energy and sanity down the road.</p><p> In my case, this year our 12 year old HVAC system broke a month after we spent a substantial amount of money repairing our home from a hailstorm. As a general rule of thumb, my wife and I try to keep about $20,000 in our cash reserves and have a liquid brokerage account that we can tap into in the unlikely event that our emergency requires greater financial support than that.  Since bank accounts are paying close to zero, I prefer to keep a smaller reserve in cash so we can have more money working for us in our liquid brokerage account</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> We recognize that our most valuable asset is not our house or a 401(k). Rather, it is our ability to get up each day and go to work.  A good financial plan protects the downside and your most valuable asset&mdash;you.  I hate paying thousands of dollars in premiums each year for something I don&rsquo;t want or expect to happen, but an accident or sickness can ruin your financial life and it is nice to know that we will not be a burden to our families if one or both of us become disabled.</p><p> My wife has a $500,000 term policy and I have about $1.5 million in permanent life insurance that will help the survivor out in the event of a premature death.  We also have the maximum amount of home and auto insurance our carries allow as well as an umbrella policy.  Lastly, long-term care insurance is not just for the elderly.  We bought a policy when we first got married and are glad we did, because a new policy today would cost more than double what we currently pay.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Sock it a Way</h3><p> <br/> Once you have invested in yourself, can save, and have taken care of the downside, it is time to start building wealth.  You might be surprised to learn that my wife and I don&rsquo;t have a budget.  We are natural savers; we pay ourselves first and make spending decisions with what is left over.  Setting up automatic savings into 401(k)s, brokerage accounts, and IRAs works really well for the bulk of Americans.</p><p> We also have been leery of &lsquo;lifestyle creep&rsquo;.  As our incomes have gone up, we have kept our lifestyle at the same, steady level. When you subtract the principal we pay on our mortgage, taxes, giving, and savings, our spending only comes out to about 35% of our gross income.  Keeping our expenses low and choosing not to have children has helped us achieve our financial goals.</p><p> Studies show that you can maximize your happiness by spending on experiences and on others instead of on stuff.  While we could afford much nicer things, I don&rsquo;t think we would be any happier if we had them.  We would much rather be financially independent than splurge on things that would only be acquired to try and impress others. </p><p> Although we spend well below our means, we don&rsquo;t feel like we are missing out on anything.  I get an enormous amount of joy by spending much of my free time reading books ($100/yr), watching Netflix ($285/yr) and playing basketball at my gym ($155/yr).  I also mow my own lawn and am happy to eat most of my meals at home.  I recently sold my 16 year old Camry with 240,000 miles on it and replaced it with a $25,000 vehicle that I am very pleased with.  Wall Street wants you to focus on the Sirens of getting rich quick with a good stock tip.  The reality for most people is simply this: how much they save is more important than the return they receive on those savings.  After all, the S&amp;P 500 is <a href=\"http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/SPX-Dow-Nasdaq-Since-Their-2000-Highs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  barely up after inflation </a> since the year 2000.    </p><h3> How We Invest</h3><p> <br/> The first thing my wife and I do each year is make the maximum allowed contributions to our 401(k) plans on a pre-tax basis.  Because I am self employed, my company can make an additional profit sharing contribution of 25 percent of my W2 wages into the 401(k).  Unless the government dramatically changes the tax rules, we should be able to pull this money out at the very low 15 percent tax bracket when we are retired.  100% of my wife&rsquo;s 401k is in a boring balanced fund that is 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds and cash.  My 401(k) is invested half in one bond fund and half in 3 stock index funds.</p><p> After we save into the 401(k) plans, we save into a whole life insurance policy and an indexed universal life insurance policy that were designed for retirement savings.  I like these policies for their tax benefits and because they don&rsquo;t lose when stocks drop.  We don&rsquo;t need really high returns to reach our goals, so why take on a bunch of unnecessary risk?</p><p> We also contribute the maximum amount we can each year to a Healthcare Savings Account.  This gives us another tax deduction for the current year and another cash reserve that can be used to pay for medical emergencies.  We pay for health care expenses from this account tax free, and anything we don&rsquo;t spend gets moved over into a balanced fund for long term growth.  We have almost $20,000 saved in this account and it will be nice to be able to rely on it to pay our healthcare expenses when we are older.</p><p> Another way we force ourselves to save is through our 15 year mortgage.  We bought our current house when I was 35 and there was comfort in knowing that if we never paid extra toward the principal, we would have a paid-for house by the time I reached age 50.  The inventor of the 30 year amortization table was a mad genius.  It almost doesn&rsquo;t matter how low your interest rate is; you pay very little in principal in the first 10 years and many people move or refinance before they build up much equity in their home.  There are benefits to getting a 30 year mortgage instead and investing the difference, but at the end of the day I don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t like debt and it feels great to be knocking almost $20,000 per year off the principal of our mortgage.</p><p> After we have covered these first four buckets, we either pay extra towards our mortgage or save to our taxable brokerage account.  The target mix for the brokerage account is simple like my 401(k): half in stocks and half in municipal bonds.  Since we don&rsquo;t keep a ton of cash reserves, it is good to have some conservative, tax free bonds in our liquid account in case we need to sell something while stocks are in the middle of a bear market.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> I am sure some people will be disappointed with how boring my financial plan is.  It would be a lot more exciting to read about how I discovered some formula to get 25 percent annual returns.  Unfortunately, the markets are almost impossible to beat over long periods of time and the best thing most of us can do is buy low-cost index funds, reduce our taxes, and buy and hold a portfolio that we can stick with for decades. There is no get-rich-quick scheme that will fix our financial problems overnight. There is only hard work driven by a solid plan.</p><p> The research in The Millionaire Next Door concluded that most millionaires didn&rsquo;t win the lottery or get a big inheritance.  The most reliable way to become a millionaire is to work hard, avoid lifestyle creep, and keep saving year after year.

Here's How to Adapt","link":"robo-advisors-make-you-nervous-heres-how-to-adapt","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"//insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=qoe326g&amp;ct=0:v0ks54e&amp;fmt=3\" width=\"1\"/></p><p> Written by: Jay Gragnani, Dorsey, Wright &amp; Associates, a Nasdaq Company</p><p> In <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/combined\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Martian </a> , Matt Damon&rsquo;s character leveraged science, technology, and every single resource he had to survive. From growing his own food and creating water, to building his own tools, to figuring out how to communicate with NASA to get home alive, his ability to adapt to constant change saved his life.</p><p> While it may feel dramatic to compare a lost astronaut&rsquo;s circumstances to the current environment in financial services, it may feel just as threatening to advisors facing the recent onslaught of new regulations and emerging technologies. Perhaps the best example of this perceived threat is the industry&rsquo;s reaction to robo-advisor platforms. Instead of seeing this advancement as a powerful resource and taking advantage of the opportunity, many advisors are paralyzed by fear. Today&rsquo;s industry headlines continue to call out robo-advisors as a major threat to advisory practices. But are they? Or are they simply the next step in the evolution of financial services?</p><p> In my 10+ years at <a href=\"http://www.dorseywright.com?source=Otherwebsite&amp;sd=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Dorsey, Wright &amp; Associates </a> , a Nasdaq Company, I&rsquo;ve seen how technology can change things for the better. In truth, if we hadn&rsquo;t adopted technology to support our business, it would look nothing like it does today. In the early days of Dorsey Wright, Point &amp; Figure charts were calculated and updated by the analysts &ndash; by hand. Hundreds of stocks every single day were updated in this manner.  In the mid-90&rsquo;s, with the launch of the website, the Point &amp; Figure charts were able to be updated and calculated by computers.  The capacity went from hundreds of charts to thousands of charts to be updated and maintained every night. Then cloud-based technology came to the rescue. The rooms full of mainframe computers vanished (remember those?!), and we were able to escalate our efforts at a rapid pace.</p><p> Using this new technology, we have been able to exponentially increase the capacity for relative strength chart calculations as well as increase the speed at which these updates are completed.   On the DWA Global Technical Research Platform we&rsquo;re now able to automate Point &amp; Figure charts and rankings for more than <u>  7 million securities and instruments on a daily basis </u> . In 40 sectors. In 77 countries worldwide. And because of our use of the DWA Platform, our team now has more resources without adding many more  people. Talk about change! As an ETF strategist and an index provider, we have used technology to help advisors stay on top of change, not lag behind it, and to leverage it to their full advantage.</p><p> For me, it&rsquo;s easy to see how powerful technology can be, partly because I witness its impact every day. If we were to receive 100 times the number of requests tomorrow than we did today, there would be no impact on our resources or our ability to do our job. The cloud gives us the flexibility to ramp up&mdash;and ramp down&mdash;to match the needs of the business. For us, technology has been the driving force of change, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be where we are today without it.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> As an adaptive advisor, what would you give to have a solution that could help service your clients 24/7 and free up your time to add greater value where it&rsquo;s needed most? How much value would you place on a marketing campaign that would attract the attention of next-generation clients&mdash;without requiring extra effort from your staff? Here are just a few quick examples of workflows and technology that are available now to help you build a better, stronger practice:</p><li> <strong>  Automated Portfolio Construction </strong> : These workflows streamline portfolio construction by enabling you to screen universes of securities and investments based on technical analysis. Holdings that fall out of favor based on the analysis can be highlighted for further investigation or automatically sold and replaced by a higher-ranked holding.</li><li> <strong>  Automated Portfolio Management Triggers </strong> : Automating parts of your asset allocation workflow can help you make recommendations that are backed by objective analysis. While there are plenty of ways to tackle this goal, one of the first steps is to automate changes in asset class and sector leadership to help inform and drive your allocation decisions.</li><li> <strong>  Investment Ideas Mining: </strong> Finding the time to identify and communicate investment ideas has never been easier than it is today using cloud technology. You can set up alerts when individual securities, portfolios, or instruments such as an ETF hit a major milestone; weed out ideas that fall out of favor; or segment your ideas by sector, geography or risk tolerance. The possibilities are almost endless.</li><li> <strong>  Mobile </strong> : Your clients and prospects expect mobile access and communication. While older clients may limit their mobile use to viewing account information and receiving emails, the next generation expects much more: from graphical portfolio reports to immediate text alerts. If you aren&rsquo;t already adopting mobile technologies, don&rsquo;t waste another minute.</li><p> <br/> In The Martian, Matt Damon knew that only two things could save him: his ability to adapt to his circumstances, and his ability to make the best possible use of every resource he had on hand. For advisors, the same is true. Now is the time to get excited about how technology can evolve your business. Adapt as quickly as you can. Explore the possibilities. And do whatever it takes to create a better future for yourself, your practice, and your clients. By embracing all technology has to offer, you&rsquo;ll not only gain the power to attract the next generation of clients to your practice, but you&rsquo;ll also have the resources you need to deliver better, faster service to retain them for years to come&mdash;all at a lower cost to you than ever.</p><p> Read more from Nasdaq Global Indexes at www.busines.nasdaq.com/nasdaq-index-insights.</p><p> To learn more the DWA Technical Research platform, <a href=\"http://www.dorseywright.com/trial?source=OtherWebsite&amp;sd=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  click here to take a free 21-day trial </a> .

I&rsquo;ve resolved the only way they can find these elusive people is to breed or grow them. </h3><p> <br/> The Medieval European merchant and craft guilds come to mind as a model for wealth management.  In this pre-mercantilist era, tradesmen banded together to sustain their common interest and respective crafts (i.e. masonry, glassworks, millinery, etc.).  The quality of what they stood for was inviolate and, transcending their crafts, bound their villages and regions together.  Notwithstanding their anti-competitive economics, the products of these guilds were widely-accepted as providing artisanal quality and, therefore, a perceived value and demand.</p><p> The wealth management industry could return to such an artisanal model with improved advisor identification and by committing resources to training and development to advisors through an apprenticeship to a journeyman stage and onto a final master stage.  Those who are masters and grand-masters will understand their duty to mentor the next generation to sustain their \"craft.\"</p><p> The pathway to becoming a counselor to families of great wealth and complexity is misaligned.  There is no early identification methodology &ndash; firms react to what the market presents to them; they often cannibalize their neighbor&rsquo;s talent or have a passive response to whatever the market produces, largely products of what the &ldquo;academy&rdquo; presents to them.  That is, individuals largely focused on degrees or vocational paths heavily tilted to finance and the capital markets where mathematics, analysis, and empiricism is predominant; not the study of the human dimension.</p><p> The academy and our industry has responded to a degree with programs (i.e. Texas Tech&rsquo;s CFP program) and credentials (CFA, CFP, CPA-PFS, CIMA, CAIA, etc.) but these formal training programs are &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; by market participants, not &ldquo;pushed.&rdquo;  </p><p> Without too grossly simplifying the issue, most financial firms including wealth management firms are populated by left-brained, rational, logical, analytical types and, rarely, by right-brained &ldquo;feelers&rdquo; or intuitive types.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Wealth management firms need to profile the intrinsic aspects or personal characteristics of the ideal advisor/counselor and have early identification systems in place to identify and recruit them.  There are many fine workplace assessment tools available today to assess personality tendencies and behavioral motivations. </p><p> Then, they need to invest in the professional development paths for these emerging professionals. The Millennials are famously forcing change, too.  If they&rsquo;re bored or perceive their employers are not investing in them, they&rsquo;ll vote with their feet and leave for another firm.</p><p> Both the client experience and firm economics can be served when firms invest in their people for the long-term.  So-called &ldquo;middle office&rdquo; personnel (i.e. apprentices and journeymen) can provide immediate operating leverage stretching senior client-facing professionals&rsquo; (i.e. masters) capacity.  Importantly, these next gen advisors can also drive the long-term enterprise value of firms as an artisanal quality service is a wealth management firm&rsquo;s ultimate value proposition and should logically drive demand and have less price resistance.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-28 11:21:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-28 11:21:38.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_IhmSK9I.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/breeding-the-next-generation-advisor/\", \"post_id\": \"12803\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-28 11:21:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-28 11:21:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"breeding-the-next-generation-advisor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12802\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6215\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/breeding-next-generation-advisor.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"692\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469782800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5974,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Net Present Value of a Lost Customer?","link":"the-net-present-value-of-a-lost-customer","source_link":null,"content":"<p> During my days in business building, I spent considerable energy in understanding the full cost of acquiring a customer, and then the net annual profit opportunity resulting in doing good business with that customer. In my case, the profit breakeven point was around eighteen months in an active customer relationship. In other words, the net profit of an individual customer relationship did not turn positive until the second half of the second year of doing business with that customer.</p><h3> The corollary to this lesson, of course, is that resolving customer dissatisfaction, even if it involves some expense, is often more profitable than the cost of the full cycle of replacing a lost customer.</h3><p> <br/> This lesson was brought back to mind this week, when I had the frustrating task of trying to find a critical part for an older (but not that old) laser printer for my home office. You have probably had a similar experience. Here&rsquo;s how it went:</p><p> My printer displayed a message telling me that the &lsquo;waste toner tank&rsquo; had to be replaced. I was in a hurry to fix the issue before going on a business trip, so I went to my local office supplies retailer&mdash;the same place where I purchase about $500 worth of toner cartridges about three times a year. The bad news was that because my printer was a few years old, they no longer carried the particular item that I needed. They suggested I try going to the store&rsquo;s online facility that should carry the item. The online search yielded nothing. I then went to three other online sites without success and eventually contacted the manufacturer.</p><p> The manufacturer service number linked me, via a VOIP connection, to a contracted-out service rep. The VOIP connection was so bad that I had to repeat every word by spelling out my information&mdash;name &lsquo;B&rsquo; for &lsquo;Bob,&rsquo; &lsquo;A&rsquo; for Apple, and so on. Finally the very nice person suggested a website for the company&rsquo;s parts department; which also no longer carried the item.</p><p> By now, I had resolved that I needed to just buy a new printer. The issue though, was that because I am a risk-averse person, I always have a supply of all of the colour toner cartridges that my existing printer uses&mdash;about $500 worth.</p><p> I went back to my local office supplies store. I enquired of the person that I spoke to there as to whether, if I purchased a new printer, they would take back my unused toner cartridges for some form of credit toward the new piece of equipment. The answer I received was, &ldquo;No &ndash; it&rsquo;s past 30 days since you bought it.&rdquo;</p><p> Frustrated, astonished, but desperate, I bought a new printer&mdash;a different make from my old one&mdash;and left the store.</p><p> I shall never buy another product, or supplies, from that store&mdash;and remember that I had been spending at least $1,500 a year there&mdash;and I will never purchase another product of the manufacturer of my old printer.</p><p> There is an old proverb that goes something like, &ldquo;let everyone leave the marketplace with a little silver in their pocket.&rdquo; The fact is that I would probably have been satisfied if the store person I had spoken to had offered me $10-20 off the purchase of a new printer for each of the unused toner cartridges I had for my old one. But he didn&rsquo;t. His attention was totally focussed on his own, short-term agenda, rather than contemplating the customer loyalty that I had shown that store&mdash;which a quick search of his database would have confirmed.</p><p> Sadly, over and above the rigours of SKU management, no one has taught this person the NPV of customer retention.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-28 12:06:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-28 12:06:26.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_QjHgYsH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-net-present-value-of-a-lost-customer/\", \"post_id\": \"12805\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-28 12:06:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-28 12:06:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-net-present-value-of-a-lost-customer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12804\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6216\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/net-present-value-lost-customer.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"741\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469779200,"author_id":377,"chart_url":""}

Mean. Unforgiving.</h3><p> <br/> But what if I told you that I have a way to get people to be less rude&hellip;.using science?</p><p> In this post, I will teach you how to:</p><p> Get people to be less rude.</p><p> More efficient.</p><p> Easier to work with.</p><p> Yes, yes and yes.</p><p> The Science</p><p> This all comes down to influencing behavior. Let&rsquo;s start with an experiment from the 1990s to illustrate this idea:</p><p> In 1996, researcher John Bargh did an <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8765481\" target=\"_blank\">  experiment </a> to see if he could influence behavior with a simple activity. The researchers had three groups of participants.</p><li> <p>  The first group, called the &ldquo;Rude Condition&rdquo;, had to unscramble a list of rude words like bold, aggressive, disturb. </p></li><li> <p>  The second group, called &ldquo;Polite Condition&rdquo;, had a series of polite words like patient, respect and respectful. </p></li><li> <p>  The last group, the &ldquo;Neutral Condition&rdquo;, had words that were neither polite nor rude. </p></li><p> When a participant was done unscrambling the words, they were given a simple task. They were told to walk down the hallway to tell the researcher they were finished. Unbeknownst to them, the researcher would be in a long fake discussion with another researcher when the participant arrived. The experiment was to test how long it would take for each group to interrupt the researcher to tell him that they were done.</p><p> The <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8765481\" target=\"_blank\">  results </a> ?</p><p> Within 10 minutes, 60% of the rude group had interrupted, while only 40% of the neutral group and 20% of the polite group had interceded.</p><p> So what does this mean? This experiment teaches us that people can be subconsciously primed to act differently.</p><p> How can we use this to our advantage AND avoid the disadvantages of subconscious priming? In one word: Wording.</p><p> You can prime people for the reaction you want with priming emails.</p><p> This is a huge advantage (and potential pitfall) of technology people often forget. Emails, texting, e-vites and social networks allow us to prime people before they take action. Here&rsquo;s how:</p><p> Use action language you want to inspire and avoid negative words you do not want to evoke.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at two examples. The first is a bad priming email:</p><h3> Bad Priming Email:</h3><p> <br/> Hi All,</p><p> As usual we have the weekly call tomorrow, Tuesday. Again, we are a little stressed for time and might have some trouble getting through the tasks on the agenda. I need everyone to please tighten up their points and avoid asking slow or lengthy questions on the call&mdash;you can send them out in an email later if you need.  I attached the agenda.</p><p> V</p><p> And now for a good priming email:</p><h3> Good Priming Email:</h3><p> <br/> Hi Team,</p><p> Tomorrow is our weekly goals call. I&rsquo;m hoping we can be really efficient because we do have a lot to discuss. If everyone can take a look at their points and prepare a well-organized overview that would be great, because then we will have plenty of time for succinct questions, if people have them. Remember you can also easily send them in an email after the call. I attached our agenda.</p><p> Best,</p><p> V</p><p> Both emails are saying the exact same thing--we have a meeting tomorrow, we have a lot to discuss, prepare your points, email us later with anything additional, etc. BUT the emails are primed entirely different with distinct language. When I started to change my emails for more positive priming, I found that people were more efficient and excited for the call. It also started a chain of nice follow-up emails. My responses to the first email usually followed my same pattern of using negative, stressful words and phrases. Amazingly, the second email produces kind, efficient language. Just like in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8765481\" target=\"_blank\">  John Bargh&rsquo;s experiment </a> !</p><h3> Words: <li>  Use positive priming words like efficient, together, helpful, goal, well-organized and team. </li> <li>  Avoid negative priming words like stress, pressure, tighten, rush, and tasks.  <br/>    </li></h3><p> Special note: This is not meant to be tricky or manipulative; it&rsquo;s simply expressing what you want to happen with positive language instead of negative.</p><p> In fact, I am now teaching this in my training with my employees and am very transparent about using it. Many of them very much appreciate this effort and use it themselves! I also find their priming emails easier to respond to, less stressful and organized. Another benefit is that even writing this way yourself, helps you feel less stressed because you are not using those words.</p><p> I encourage you to try priming not just in emails, but also in:</p><li> Texts</li><li> Handouts</li><li> Powerpoints</li><li> Social network updates</li><li> Evites <br/>  </li><p> Priming is such an interesting topic, especially because it allows you to see its effect on your employees, colleagues, clients right away.

During my more than a decade relationship with the brand, I&rsquo;ve never ceased to be amazed by the commitment of Starbucks leaders when it comes to continuous improvement for both the customer and employee experience.</p><p> Recently, for example, Starbucks has loosened up the employee (referred to as partner) dress code &ndash; expanding the acceptable clothing color pallet beyond black, khaki, and white. They have also given the &ldquo;green light&rdquo; on green or whatever hair color suits the fancy of the partner.</p><p> In addition to partner engagement, leadership is also targeting customer experience enhancements driven by process changes and technology deployment. From a process perspective, Starbucks continues to explore ways to increase the speed of service. In fact, the brand recently opened its first &ldquo;express store&rdquo; in London&rsquo;s Canary Wharf. That express store has divided the customer experience into 3 phases (order, pay and collect) and streamlines all processes and product options in order to cut the service time across the three phases by a factor of 50%. In addition to the London store, similar express stores will open soon in Toronto, Chicago, and New York.</p><p> When it comes to technology, Starbucks is elevating its mobile app to better fit a customer&rsquo;s past purchase behavior. During an earnings call, Starbucks Chief Strategy Officer Matt Ryan noted, &ldquo;We now have the opportunity, both in an email, which we&rsquo;ve just begun, and this quarter, in our app, to do suggested selling. So we will be suggesting and making personalized offers within the context of our app that will allow people to see things that are right for them.&rdquo;</p><p> Since most of us aren&rsquo;t running coffee shops, what can we learn from these recent Starbucks moves:</p><p> In 7 words:</p><h3> Make the Experience Faster and More Personal</h3><p> <br/> While service speed and emotional engaging service may seem like opposite goals, Starbucks leadership is looking to expedite delivery AND make an authentic personal emotional connection with team members and customers.</p><p> When employee and customer engagement becomes challenging set a course for expedited service delivery that seeks to meet customers where they are!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-28 12:34:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-28 12:34:24.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_vqyk0l9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/make-the-experience-faster-and-more-personal/\", \"post_id\": \"12810\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-28 12:34:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-28 12:34:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"make-the-experience-faster-and-more-personal\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12809\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6218\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/make-experience-faster-and-more-personal.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"497\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469786400,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5978,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Trends to Keep Your Content Creation Skills Sharp and On Point","link":"4-trends-to-keep-your-content-creation-skills-sharp-and-on-point","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The presence of online content is equally as ubiquitous as social media; while it may sound bold to compare anything to social media&rsquo;s prevalence, it just goes to show how powerful content marketing has become. <br/>  </h3><p> While we are just over halfway done with 2016, there have already been some major shifts in the content landscape; some to an irreversible degree.</p><p> As the year progresses these dramatic transformations will continue to unfold. Thankfully, the heart and soul of content has not, and will not change; valuable, actionable, informative, and unique is still the name of the game. What will change, however, is the way in which content appears, the way it is delivered, and who is bringing this content to the table.</p><h3> If you want to keep your content creation skills sharp and on point, then check out these four trends to monitor throughout the year. <br/>  </h3><h3> #1: Text-Based Content Begins Its Demise <br/>  </h3><p> Things have been heading in this direction for a few years now, but it looks like 2016 is going to be the tipping point where the shift begins; video begins to strip text of its content crown. It has been predicted by various sources that before the decade is out video will account for the majority of all online traffic.</p><p> This is starting to become extremely apparent as live streaming platforms like Blab, Periscope, Meerkat, Twitch, and a variety of others come into existence. Most of which are flourishing to the extent that major social media outlets can&rsquo;t help but take notice.</p><p> Facebook recently introduced Facebook Live, Google has unveiled YouTube Connect, Snapchat 2.0 has its own broadcast feature, and so on. Not only that, but recently Instagram began to integrate video more heavily into its platform as well.</p><p> As the average attention span continues to decline and written content persists in oversaturating the web, people will look to video as a quick, engaging, and entertaining way to consume information; and all social channels will be happy to oblige.</p><h3> #2: New Publishing Platforms Prevail <br/>  </h3><p> As of late, a new trend in publishing has emerged where social media websites are attempting to transform themselves into &ldquo;cul-de-sacs&rdquo; by offering content creators the option to publish their materials directly through the site. This effectively provides users with articles that load instantly and keeps users on the social platform instead of sending them elsewhere.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> While Facebook may have started this upheaval, they are not the only ones joining the fight. Google recently announced its version of Instant Articles: Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, which aims to provide mobile users with the same responsiveness of Facebook&rsquo;s publishing option for mobile devices. Twitter has collaborated on this project alongside Google and links in Twitter posts will reportedly be sent to AMP sites as soon as they become more widespread.</p><p> Similarly, Snapchat&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discover&rdquo; section is also wrestling to become publisher supreme with various media outlets like Vice, CNN, BuzzFeed, National Geographic, and other prominent names all featured.</p><p> Social is your content&rsquo;s new publisher whether you like it or not.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> #3: Content Becomes Highly Interactive <br/>  </h3><p> All throughout 2015 leading into today, virtual reality has been one of the most talked about and anticipated technologies to hit the market since the iPhone. With platforms like the Facebook-owned Oculus Rift ready to hit shelves later this year, it is only a matter of time until content makes its way onto these devices.</p><p> These products have the potential to custom-tailor highly interactive content like never before. The possibilities and social media integration capabilities alone almost guarantee that content for these platforms is already in the works.</p><h3> #4:  A Different Kind of Influencer <br/>  </h3><p> Influencer marketing has officially broken into the mainstream and become a widely accepted modality. In 2016, things are going to get shaken up as company employees will be thrown into the mix through employee advocacy programs.</p><p> In May of last year, Scredible published a report documenting that 54% of 20 &ndash; 45-year-old professionals believe their social media accounts will be a career asset in the next five years. This means that more individuals are pushing to become influencers whether consciously or unconsciously. With the tools and information available online, anyone can make that leap and many companies will be happy to support.</p><p> 2016 is the year that content changes forever. Prepare yourself by following these trends closely, becoming an early adopter of the new technologies, and getting your content on the front lines of the content revolution.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-28 16:31:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-28 16:31:36.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_VORFaVt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-trends-to-keep-your-content-creation-skills-sharp-and-on-point/\", \"post_id\": \"12821\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-28 16:31:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-28 16:31:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-trends-to-keep-your-content-creation-skills-sharp-and-on-point\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12820\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6220\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/4-trends-keep-your-content-creation-skills-sharp-and-point.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"557\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469804400,"author_id":484,"chart_url":""}

What are the most elemental ingredients that need to be &ldquo;accelerated?&rdquo; Here are four fundamental ones:</p><p> <strong>  Trust.  </strong> This is the client&rsquo;s belief that you are: competent to deliver what they need; focused on their agenda not yours (i.e., will put their interests first); reliable and consistent; and have integrity.</p><p> <strong>  Value.  </strong> When you add lots of value early in the relationship, it helps build that feeling of trust and it creates an eager desire to have more from you. It pulls the client into the relationship.</p><p> <strong>  Emotional Connection. </strong>  I like to call this &ldquo;Emotional Resonance.&rdquo; The other person needs to feel a personal connection to you&mdash;they must feel like they know who you are and are comfortable sharing their concerns and needs with you. To create this you need face time, but you also need to be skilled at asking the right questions and willing to show a quality of openness yourself.</p><p> <strong>  Relevance to their Current Goals. </strong>  You may offer trust, value, and emotional connection but the client must perceive you as offering something very specifically relevant to their current and most urgent priorities.</p><p> So ask yourself: Am I doing the right things to build trust? Am I adding real value in our discussions? Have I connected personally and built rapport? And, am I focusing on issues of immediate and urgent concern to this person&mdash;their concerns, not what I want to sell?</p><h3> Nine Acceleration Strategies <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Offer an issue-specific working session. </strong></p><p> First, identify an issue of real importance to your client. Second, establish your credibility in that area by illustrating what you&rsquo;re doing to successfully address it with other clients, and/or providing insight through a point of view or framework that helps your client see the issue more clearly. Then, offer to run a working session&mdash;a few hours or even half a day&mdash;to explore it more deeply. One CFO told me, when referring to one of his trusted advisors, &ldquo;This was their ticket to building a deeper relationship with me: Taking a &lsquo;deep dive&rsquo; every year into a topic of interest.&rdquo;</p><p> Is there a working session&mdash;a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo;&mdash;you could propose to a client?</p><p> <strong>  2. Get your client out of the office. </strong></p><p> One of the fastest ways to accelerate the development of a relationship is to change the relationship environment. Take your client out to lunch or dinner. Go to a conference with them. Create an offsite event that includes lots of time for informal discussions and personal bonding.</p><p> Are you creating opportunities interact with your client outside the office?</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> <strong>  3. Use speed. </strong></p><p> Speed is an underutilized and undervalued quality that can have a huge impact on a relationship. My belief is this: The longer it takes you to diagnose the problem and the longer your delivery for any given project or solution gets dragged out beyond your initial estimate, the less profitable it becomes and the less impact it has. Speed things up with your client! For example:</p><p> &bull; After meeting with your client, get back to them quickly (within 24 hours) with a summary of what you discussed and the next steps. <br/> &bull; Diagnose rapidly. Don&rsquo;t take weeks or months to &ldquo;assess&rdquo; the problem. It&rsquo;s impressive when you can quickly identify what&rsquo;s wrong and how to fix it. <br/> &bull; Finish your first engagement on time and on budget. Don&rsquo;t stretch it out&mdash;except under certain circumstances (for example, it the problem is far worse than anyone thought), it will lose impact.</p><p> Are you using speed to create impact and short-term value for your client? Or is your work getting dragged out?</p><p> <strong>  4. Use questions, early on, to connect personally. </strong></p><p> The best way to start creating the &ldquo;emotional resonance&rdquo; that I mentioned at the beginning is through thoughtful questions that engage the other person on an emotional rather than purely rational level. These include questions about their background, their past experiences, where they grew up, how they like to spend time outside of work; and, questions that appeal to the right brain, versus the analytical left brain, such as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious, what are working on right now that your are most passionate about?&rdquo;</p><p> Are you asking thoughtful questions that engage and draw out your client on a more personal level?</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><p> <strong>  5. Transfer trust from someone else. </strong></p><p> An introduction or recommendation from someone your prospect or client already trusts is a powerful way to accelerate trust with you. Many CEOs have told me, point-blank: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unlikely I will meet with someone I don&rsquo;t already know unless they have been recommended to me by a colleague or friend I trust.&rdquo; A good word on your behalf from another senior executive will catalyze your relationship.</p><p> Do you know someone who can provide a reference or testimonial that will &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; a stalled relationship?</p><p> <strong>  6. Do an assessment. </strong></p><p> A brief assessment that is low-cost or even free can be a terrific way of gaining early face time and engagement, either with a new prospect or with an existing client. An assessment of an important problem or opportunity provides valuable information quickly to the client, it is low risk, it creates a showcase for your problem-solving skills and insights, and it usually provides opportunities for the face time that builds trust.</p><p> Is there an issue around which you could offer to do a rapid assessment for your client?</p><p> <strong>  7. Help them through a crucible. </strong></p><p> A crucible has several different meanings. One is &ldquo;an occasion of severe test or trial.&rdquo; Another is &ldquo;a place or situation in which different elements interact to produce something new.&rdquo; Crucible experiences are super-catalysts for relationship acceleration. You can&rsquo;t &ldquo;create&rdquo; a crisis that you then help your client confront. But you can be alert to one, and be prepared to jump in and help.</p><p> Has there been a re-organization? A new CEO? Is new technology and digitization threatening your client&rsquo;s traditional business model? Is your client struggling to set priorities and lead incisively? Is there a performance gap?  These can all present opportunities to help your client through a crucible. And after you do, the relationship will be on a different, higher plane.</p><p> The second type of crucible is also quite interesting. Could you help your client assess how different elements (trends, technologies, competitive actions, etc.) are coming together to change industry dynamics? Could you help them innovate by enabling the intersection of disparate ideas/information (e.g., about the interaction of customer behavior and digital technology)?</p><p> Is there a crucible you can help your client understand and/or overcome?</p><p> <strong>  8. Invest to figure out their real agenda. </strong></p><p> Remember, most busy executives won&rsquo;t make a lot of time for a relationship with you unless they perceive that you are highly relevant to their agenda of critical priorities and goals. But it&rsquo;s not always so easy to find out their real agenda. I&rsquo;m willing to invest a lot to understand what&rsquo;s really important to my client&mdash;without that information I&rsquo;m not as relevant as I could be, and getting the face time that builds trust and likeability becomes problematic.</p><p> This is a big topic, but think about simple things like talking to more junior staff members who are knowledgeable about their boss&rsquo;s priorities, developing points of view about key issues in their business that will stimulate a discussion about what&rsquo;s really bothering them, sharing examples about what your other clients are doing (to achieve the same effect), doing secondary research to uncover issues, and so on.</p><p> Do you really understand your client&rsquo;s business and personal agendas?</p><p> <strong>  9. Finally, be generous. </strong></p><p> Generosity is a key enabler of the relationship-building process. If you think the relationship is worth developing, be generous with your time, your ideas, your knowledge of the industry or function you&rsquo;re working in, and so on. Sure, a small percentage of clients may take advantage of this and not reciprocate or appreciate your efforts, but most will. A little generosity&mdash;authentic generosity, not one that is purely aimed at creating reciprocal behavior&mdash;goes a long way towards building trust.</p><p> What acts of generosity have you performed lately?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-28 16:42:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-28 16:42:22.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_rcROlGB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/strategies-that-can-help-accelerate-a-client-relationship/\", \"post_id\": \"12823\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-28 16:42:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-28 16:42:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"strategies-that-can-help-accelerate-a-client-relationship\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12822\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6221\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/strategies-can-help-accelerate-client-relationship.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"757\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469779200,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5980,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Use Refinancing for Anyone Cash-Strapped in Retirement","link":"how-to-use-refinancing-for-anyone-cash-strapped-in-retirement","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Recently mortgage rates dropped to their lowest rates in history. At the moment, rates are sitting at an amazing 3.25% to 3.75% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. <br/>  </h3><p> For anyone still holding on to high-interest debt&mdash;including retirees&mdash;this is great news. Surprised to hear the word &ldquo;retiree&rdquo; in that statement? You&rsquo;re not alone. Common wisdom has long held that retirement is not the time to rework debt, but today&rsquo;s low-interest rates are anything but common, and in some cases they can be the welcome bearer of financial opportunity. That was certainly the case for Martha.</p><p> When Martha was widowed 10 years ago, she bought a townhome in a senior-citizen community that was closer to her son and grandkids. Just 58 years old at the time, she was still working and could easily afford her mortgage, car payment, and other expenses on her salary. When we met last week, however, we had some new challenges to tackle.</p><p> Now 68, Martha was unwittingly thrown into full retirement when she was laid off from her job last year. Without a paycheck, her monthly income has been reduced significantly to $2,850. She&rsquo;s receiving $1,750 from Social Security, $100 from her pension, and $1,000 after-tax net from an IRA withdrawal, but with a mortgage payment of $750, plus Homeowners Association (HOA) fees of $250 a month and a $175 car payment, her expendable income is very limited, to say the least.</p><p> When I first mentioned the idea of refinancing to Martha, she was surprised. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I could qualify now that I&rsquo;m retired. Is it really possible?&rdquo; I assured her that as long we could verify her income, refinancing was very possible&mdash;even if that income is coming from retirement savings rather than a salary. Working together, we came up with a great plan that puts today&rsquo;s interest rates to work for Martha&rsquo;s cash-strapped situation. Here&rsquo;s how we did it:</p><li> The interest rate on Martha&rsquo;s $100,000 mortgage is currently at 4.375%, and she owes $6,000 on her car. We started by seeking a new mortgage rate of 3.25% to 3.73% to immediately reduce her biggest monthly payment.</li><li> Choosing the lowest available rate didn&rsquo;t make sense since the closing costs were quoted at $3,500, which would take a couple of years to pay back. To combat the challenge, we shopped around and were able to get a $107,000 loan at 3.625%, with low closing costs of only $1,000.</li><li> To verify Martha&rsquo;s income, the lender requested an income verification letter from Guerin Financial stating the likelihood of being able to withdraw $1,000 a month from her IRA for many years to come.</li><li> To add to her monthly net income, we used the new mortgage to pay off her car loan. This put an additional $175 a month in Martha&rsquo;s pocket.</li><li> We rolled Martha&rsquo;s closing costs into the refinanced amount to eliminate out-of-pocket costs associated with the refinance.</li><li> By reducing her mortgage interest rate from 4.375% to 3.625% and eliminating her car payment, we were able to reduce her monthly payments by $265 a month, or $3,180 a year.</li><li> To sweeten the deal, assuming she closes in August, her first payment won&rsquo;t be due until October, saving her an additional two months of mortgage payments, totaling $1,500.</li><p> The new plan makes it financially possible for Martha to stay in her townhome for much longer, and the cash savings will improve her quality of life.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> If you&rsquo;re in retirement now and paying 4% or more on an existing mortgage, refinancing may be a good option to help lower your monthly payments and eliminate other high-interest debt. Be sure to keep these tips in mind and, of course, work with your financial advisor to be sure refinancing is the right choice for your specific situation:</p><li> <strong>  Keep your eye on  </strong> <strong>  interest rate  </strong> <strong>  changes  </strong> to take advantage of the current environment.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to refinancing your mortgage </strong> . Including a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), a car loan, or other high-interest debt may save you even more money.</li><li> <strong>  Shop different lenders and compare quotes.  </strong> Martha&rsquo;s lender was flexible with how we structured closing costs with the interest rate. A lower rate of 3.5% would have increased her closing cost by $1,000, so we opted for the slightly higher rate. </li><li> <strong>  Be sure you can verify your income.  </strong> Income verification can be tricky for retirees. Consult your financial advisor to decide whether you can support income requirements and to help with the income verification process.</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-28 16:48:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-28 16:48:34.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_mlkIPfl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-use-refinancing-for-anyone-cash-strapped-in-retirement/\", \"post_id\": \"12825\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-28 16:48:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-28 16:48:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-use-refinancing-for-anyone-cash-strapped-in-retirement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12824\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6222\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-use-refinancing-anyone-cash-strapped-retirement.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"887\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469782800,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}

Two Key Strategies to Embrace","link":"how-does-customer-experience-fuel-innovation-two-key-strategies-to-embrace","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> How does customer experience fuel innovation? <br/>  </h3><p> I was honored to be a guest on #innochat on Thursday, July 21. Innochat is a weekly Twitter chat (Thursdays, 9am PT) about innovation and covers a wide range of topics and angles. If you love talking innovation, make time for this chat every Thursday. <br/> <br/> The topic on July 21 was one of my favorites: customer experience, of course. Not just customer experience, though, but how customer experience drives or fuels innovation. This is a hot topic. We want (need) to see companies innovate for the customer, but many companies still struggle with what that means, how to do it, and what it takes to truly be innovative; instead, they imitate. I think Kerry Bodine said it well in her 2013 Harvard Business Review article: </p><p> \"Everyone talks about customer experience innovation, but no one knows quite what it is or how to attain it. In fact, when we ask customer experience professionals how they&rsquo;re driving their innovation efforts, we find several misguided approaches that actually thwart differentiation and waste massive amounts of time and money in the process.\"</p><p> You're not innovative if you imitate; innovation is all about creating a clear differentiation between you and the next guy. What value does your brand bring to the table that no other brand does? How does it make customers' lives - and the jobs they are trying to do - easier?  <br/> <br/> The questions posed to the group were pretty straightforward, yet thought-provoking; they also seeded future #innochats, when the self-named \"innocats\" (love that) can dive deeper into customer experience innovation. This is an important topic with many different angles to cover. The questions we discussed were:</p><li> What role do you think that customer experience plays in innovation?</li><li> How does customer experience relate to user experience?</li><li> What is the relationship between customer service and customer experience?</li><li> How does the view of customer experience from the outside-in compare with the inside-out view?</li><li> How do we balance the importance of customer experience with other issues?</li><p> For a transcript of the chat, visit Innochat and scroll to the bottom of the page.</p><h3> Two really big (and key) things to think about as you look at your organization's ability to innovate a great customer experience are your customers and your culture: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Understand your customers <br/>  </h3><p> In order to innovate for your customers, you need to engage with them, listen to them, understand who they are and so much more - but most importantly, you need to understand what they are trying to do: what task, what job, what they are trying to achieve. </p><p> \"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!\" - Theodore Levitt</p><h3> 2. Create a culture of innovation <br/>  </h3><p> The culture needs to allow employees to be creative and entrepreneurial. Don't stifle new ideas and innovation. Allow employees to pose, develop, and try new ways of doing the same old thing. Encourage efficiency, simplicity, and killing old rules and making new ones. I can speak from experience when I say that that stifling creativity, growth, and innovation is painful and kills employee engagement quicker than anything.   <br/> <br/> A few years ago, I wrote about the Culture of Curiosity. Perhaps that's a place to start. Advocating and driving such a culture throws inside-out and outside-in thinking aside for the moment and calls for upside-down thinking. Toss everything you know out the window for the moment, and think differently.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> \"Around here, however, we don't look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we're curious...and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.\" - Walt Disney Company</p><p> If employees are constantly asking questions and being curious, they get to:</p><li> Learn more about their customers</li><li> Better understand customer needs and, more importantly, the jobs they are trying to do</li><li> Learn about partners, the market, emerging trends, etc.</li><li> Ideate and innovate</li><li> Create new/better products, features, and services</li><li> Eliminate processes and policies that are harmful to the experience</li><li> Change the way the company does business (for the better)</li><p> \"The problem is that, at a lot of big companies, process becomes a substitute for thinking. You're encouraged to behave like a little gear in a complex machine. Frankly, it allows you to keep people who aren't that smart, who aren't that creative.\" - Elon Musk</p><p> If you keep doing the same thing, you're going to keep getting the same results, right? With some of the statistics about customer experience as bad as they continue to be, I think companies are continuing to do the same thing. So it's time to start asking some serious questions and not be afraid of the answers - or the consequences and changes as a result.</p><p> Innovation and change go hand in hand. That's a good thing.

So, how do snap out of the autopilot habit? You have to start plugging in as a leader.</p><p> Here are four questions that you need to answer, not just when hiring, not once a year, not even once a week but, every single day.</p><h3> 1. Who are they? <br/>  </h3><p> You need to really plug into your employees. Not just on a professional level, but on a personal level. Who are they? What is their family like? What are their hobbies? This doesn&rsquo;t mean you become your employees&rsquo; best friend. What it does mean is that you get to know them, show interest in them as individuals, and show that you care about them and their lives.</p><h3> 2. What do they know? <br/>  </h3><p> You need to plug into your employees&rsquo; knowledge. Each of your employees brings with them a specific set of skills and a unique collection of experiences. What do they know? When you know what your employees bring to the table, you know how they can best benefit the organization and, you also know how you can best benefit them.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 3. What do they want? <br/>  </h3><p> You need to plug into what your employees want. What are their goals? What are they passionate about? When you know what they want, not only can you earn their trust and loyalty by helping them achieve their goals, you are in a better position to motivate and inspire them. When you help your employees achieve the things they want, you give them meaning and the satisfaction of being part of something important.</p><h3> 4. What do they need? <br/>  </h3><p> You need to plug into the needs of your employees. Employees are more effective, more productive, and more dedicated when their needs are met in the workplace. Do they need additional training? Are they lacking necessary resources? What type of work environment do they need in order to give their best effort? When you meet the needs of your employees, their performance will rise to a whole new level.</p><h3> Plug In <br/>  </h3><p> You can&rsquo;t lead effectively if you go through your day operating on autopilot. Break the autopilot cycle by plugging in. Who are your employees? What do they know? What do they want? What do they need? These are the questions that you need to answer on a daily basis. When you know the answers, you can truly start leading.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-28 17:09:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-28 17:09:32.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_rJWPPAJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-much-of-your-time-is-spent-on-autopilot-ask-yourself-these-4-questions-daily/\", \"post_id\": \"12829\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-28 17:09:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-28 17:09:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-much-of-your-time-is-spent-on-autopilot-ask-yourself-these-4-questions-daily\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12828\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6224\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/How-Much-of-Your-Time-Is-Spent-on-Autopilot-Ask-Yourself-These-4-Questions-Daily.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"872\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469811600,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

Trying to catch the life you want hidden inside your dreams will never come to fruition if your attempts are when you&rsquo;re sleep. Living the life you want and having work-life balance doesn&rsquo;t have to be a dream. In fact, it&rsquo;s closer than you realize if you are REALLY ready to put yourself first!</p><p> There are a million reasons why you haven&rsquo;t been able to put yourself on your list. For starters, you&rsquo;ve been making yourself available to everyone around you at any given time, no matter the cost. Your career is also a one-sided association. Sure, you receive a check for your work but the compensation for your efforts and office politics you are inherently required to navigate thru far exceed your earnings.     </p><p> Let&rsquo;s stop talking about creating the life you want, one filled with balance, time, fulfillment and joy. How about you start making a conscientious effort to move towards it, without the reasons that quickly turn into our ritualistic excuses&hellip;  I&rsquo;ve decided to pull out a few key questions that I ask the bold women and a few brave men that I work with inside our coaching circles and share them with you here. Are you ready?</p><p> I advise you to pull out pen and paper for this next section.</p><h3> <strong>  The Gentle 8 </strong> (a few easy questions) <br/>  </h3><li> On an average week, how many hours do you work?</li><li> Do you work more than one job? If so, how many (including Part-time and Per-diem positions)?</li><li> It&rsquo;s clear that money matters. Do you make enough money to cover your basic necessities comfortably?</li><li> If yes, are you worried that you can&rsquo;t live the life you want unless you work the amount of hours you currently do? If no, have you had a transition in your life over the last 24 months that has impacted your ability to pay your basic bills?</li><li> How does money make you feel? When you are not working to pay for basic living needs, what are you working for? In other words, when you are working overtime that is not required by your employer, how often is the effort solely for something you want?</li><li> Do you have an emergency fund beyond your retirement savings?</li><li> What are your current hobbies? What are your current passions in life?</li><li> When was the last time you took more than 2 hours to enjoy time with yourself, alone? Do you have a hard time sitting still or being alone? If so, why do you think that is? <br/>  </li><p> You have a nurturing spirit and everyone close to you knows it. At some point the position of go-to was bestowed unto you by those around you and, over time, the burden has worn you down.  The reality is you haven&rsquo;t done a great job at helping them to understand your limits. To this point, you&rsquo;ve been a seemingly bottomless source of love, energy, resources, and knowledge.</p><p> Many of the people who continuously take from you are called Energy Zappers. They come to you consistently for help and guidance; and, albeit unintentionally, they&rsquo;ve left you exhausted. Often times Energy Zappers are repeat offenders. Sometimes, it can be those closest to you. You may be confused as to why you feel immensely lethargic in the presence of a best friend or a sudden fit of anger when a certain family member calls you asking for help or a favor. The crucial characteristic in a relationship with Zappers is you&rsquo;re faithfully there for them but they&rsquo;re never around when you need them. The feeling you have, around specific people, which I&rsquo;m sure you can envision right now &ndash; that&rsquo;s called being zapped.</p><p> Right now you&rsquo;re asking yourself, <strong>  &ldquo;How do I keep allowing myself to get zapped?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  The Honest 7 </strong> ( It&rsquo;s time to take a deep dive in and get honest with yourself) <br/>  </h3><li> Over the last two to five years, how many people have you had to cut out of your life?</li><li>  Did you cut these people out of your life because of an incident or because of exhaustion?</li><li> Were you able to have a conversation with the person(s) about why you needed to distance yourself from them?</li><li> Did you choose not to have the conversation?</li><li> Whether you had the conversation or not, what were you concerned about?</li><li> Do you have people in your life that you currently need to disconnect from but you&rsquo;re having a difficult time doing so?</li><li> Do you avoid ending relationships out of fear of being alone, not wanting to hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings, hoping that time will heal the relationship, etc.?</li><p> Willing to go deeper?</p><h3> <strong>  The 9 Dive </strong> (Let&rsquo;s Pull the curtain back and expose the black mold underneath) <br/>  </h3><li> Where do you feel most vulnerable, in your relationships, at work, in life?</li><li> How do you feel when you have to say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to someone you work with?</li><li> How do you feel when you have to say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to someone you work for?</li><li> How do you feel when you have to say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to someone you love?</li><li> How do you feel when you have to say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to someone you are friends with?</li><li> How does it feel when others say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to you?</li><li> Do you think saying &lsquo;No&rsquo; limits your ability to receive abundance of any kind?</li><li> Will there be a consequence for saying &lsquo;No&rdquo; from those who are accustomed to you saying yes?</li><li> Are you prepared to handle the backlash, tantrums or begging that may come from those you take a stand with by voicing what may be the 1 st &lsquo;No&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve ever heard from you? <br/>  </li><p> Staying guarded is feasible if you&rsquo;re willing and it doesn&rsquo;t require you to get into a fighter&rsquo;s stance each time someone approaches you for a favor &ndash; though, you may want to, at times.</p><h3> <strong>  3 Things to Remember to Keep Your Guard Strong. </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> You have every right to say &lsquo;No&rsquo;. But you have to learn to accept that saying &lsquo;No&rsquo; is okay before anyone else will be willing to accept the same. </li><li> Before making a serious commitment (of any kind) take an account of where you are at that time, how you are feeling and how that obligation will fit into your life in addition to what it will do for that person (or company).</li><li> Remember, if the airplane experiences extreme turbulence and the oxygen masks drop from the ceiling, you cannot help anyone else if you do not put on your oxygen mask first. I know this may be an overused metaphor but the meaning is apropos. There&rsquo;s nothing immoral about putting you first.   </li><p> <br/> <strong>  &ldquo;Out of all the important things you must fix, the most important is you.&rdquo; </strong> - Naketa R.

{"original_id":5984,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Ready for CRM2 Changes in Your Business?","link":"are-you-ready-for-crm2-changes-in-your-business","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The only constant is change. With July 15, 2016, come and gone, are you ready for CRM2 changes in your business? <br/>  </h3><p> Working with advisors, the number one challenge that CRM2 brings is capacity. The number one practice management problem for financial advisors is lack of capacity to serve clients.</p><p> This comes from the Book &ldquo;Practice Made More Perfect&rdquo;, Mark C. Tibergien &amp; Rebecca Pomering Bloomberg Press 2011. Capacity for financial advisors includes a shortfall of not enough ideal clients or too many clients. It is more than just time management, it is practice management.</p><h3> The problem is going to get worse  <br/>  </h3><p> But the capacity problem is only going to get worse in 2016 and 2017. When I ask advisors in workshops across the country &ldquo;When your clients see the fees for advice for the first time, will they want or expect more service?&rdquo; Most advisors answer, &ldquo;Yes they will want or expect more&rdquo;. Then I ask, &ldquo;How much more will your clients want or expect from you and your team?&rdquo; If you have 200 clients and they will all need some time to explain the fees, discuss your value and deliver more service, how will you tackle this problem?</p><p> For example, you have two hundred clients and you expect that they will all need at least one or two more hours to deliver more comprehensive value proposition and more service, then where is the 200-400 extra hours going to come from in 2016? Do you plan to work more hours next year? Do you want to tell your spouse and family to cancel holidays next year? If you are at capacity now, where will 200-400 hours come from? How will you deliver more and meet expectations, articulate and deliver your value? Problem, yes, big challenge, yes, ignored by most, yes.</p><p> Until it becomes a problem, we tend to ignore things because we are too busy today to tackle the problem. It creeps up on us and hits us on a Wednesday afternoon, when an ideal client comes in and wants an updated comprehensive approach to their finances by the end of the week. It comes when a progress update meeting results in loads of paperwork that has to be completed and you are running out to your kid&rsquo;s hockey game.</p><h3> Is this a potential problem in your business? <br/>  </h3><p> The only way to find out is to discuss your fees, and value delivered to your existing clients by building and maintaining a formal feedback process and having critical conversations around your value promise.</p><p> Without feedback we cannot know what the client expectations are, especially if we have not discussed fees in dollar terms before, and what you deliver for the fees.</p><p> Finding out that you are meeting and exceeding client expectations in the new world of CRM2 regulation will give you comfort knowing the only capacity issue you will have is how many new ideal clients you can manage next year. If you are meeting and exceeding expectations, and delivering a high-value process, investors will beat a path to your door.</p><h3> How will you manage your capacity? <br/>  </h3><p> Top advisors manage their capacity by taking more time off. They have the systems and processes in place with their staff to service clients and manage expectations. They have the processes to deliver comprehensive services and do regular feedback to meet and exceed expectations. They are great at delegating and building processes such as client checklists, service checklists and follow up checklists to meet and exceed expectations and have a way of articulating their value that clients understand. They have practised it, over and over and use it consistently to service their ideal clients. They focus their time and energy on the things that bring value to their ideal clients and delegate the rest. Then they take more time off. Remember, Wayne Gretzky did not sharpen his own skates.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> It starts with stronger conversations <br/>  </h3><p> Robo-advisors have difficulty with this. With stronger conversations, you will thrive in the new world of regulatory change, digital advisors, and confidently grow your business regardless of any disruption that comes your way.

{"original_id":5985,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Know The Market: Guess Free Selling Delivers Superior Profits","link":"know-the-market-guess-free-selling-delivers-superior-profits","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;Commodity&rdquo;: a good for which there is a demand, but which is supplied without qualitative differentiation across a market. <br/>  </h3><p> In 1984 Scientific American published an article about &ldquo;Bargaining&rdquo; based on work done by Edward T. Hall for the US Department of State. It introduces the notion of a &ldquo;Pivot-Price&rdquo;. </p><p> Hall uses a Middle Eastern market as a backdrop to illustrate the phenomenon that &ndash; &ldquo;whether for a squash in a bazaar or a hydroelectric dam&rdquo; it is important to be keenly aware of the central number around which the good or service is actually selling in the market at any given time. </p><p> Much like a trader must know the latest bid/ask value of a stock he specializes in, salespeople need to be specialists in the &ldquo;markets&rdquo; for the key products or services they sell, dispassionate of their own personal opinions of up or down, before entering into a sales process or a negotiation. We call these key prices &ldquo;hot-buttons&rdquo; because they represent the numbers for standardized products which may be very familiar to the buyer or are easily accessible to the prospect from on-line or other sources like a competitor. Caution: the buyer is probability more knowledgeable about the &ldquo;total pricing equation&rdquo;, the net price after discounts, rebates, etc., than you are as the seller. This is especially true for smaller vendors selling to larger customers.</p><p> Markets are becoming more efficient by the day. With the advent of the on-line marketplace and the rise of standardized goods and certified practices, even complex or proprietary goods or services that are bought on a regular basis have well defined and efficient markets. If the product you are selling is common enough in the marketplace it tends to become what we call &ldquo;commoditized&rdquo;. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> This means that the quality of the specific product or standardized service level is taken as a given; and if you fail to  deliver the case for a GFS Investment, then the only thing that will define you and your company is price. You are effectively relegated to little more than a number, and once that is established it is irreversible. To generate superior margin you must know the GFS process and take your customers and prospects through the Investment step in a GFS way.</p><p> Hall goes on to point out that substantial errors in unqualified pricing can lead to serious consequences. Too high &ndash; the customer doubts your knowledge of the market or your opinion of them as a buyer and rejects you and your offer. Too low &ndash; the buyer will buy of course, but you&rsquo;ve set a &ldquo;discount expectation&rdquo; in the mind of the buyer that will haunt you in future negotiations. The key GFS word here is &ldquo;unqualified&rdquo;.</p><p> Again, failing to establish the investment value (for detail see &ldquo;Investment&rdquo; in your book) condemns you to &ldquo;price prison&rdquo; meaning you&rsquo;ll sell at the latest (read cheapest) price in the market and often below it, especially when concluding new business.</p><p> But Hall&rsquo;s work suggests the following silver lining. Sellers who are both market savvy and systematic in the GFS process will command a consistent premium to the competition because every market has premium price if the seller has made the effort to establish its value. This requires organizational discipline and a commitment to the GFS process</p><p> Guidelines about GFS pricing:</p><p> 1) Know your prospects/customers &ldquo;hot button&rdquo; items &ndash; know the markets for these items including the latest discounts and rebates being offered.</p><p> 2) Stay current on what competitors are quoting/offering on &ldquo;hot-button&rdquo; items. Best to have a staff member who is responsible for keeping tabs on the competition including new products that may threaten an established line.</p><p> 3) Practice the GFS process until it is second nature. Never allow your customer to get to price first. Remember Investment follows Authority and precedes Presentation; stay in the GFS process throughout.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-28 17:24:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-28 17:24:21.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_VMb1Opy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/know-the-market-guess-free-selling-delivers-superior-profits/\", \"post_id\": \"12835\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-28 17:24:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-28 17:24:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"know-the-market-guess-free-selling-delivers-superior-profits\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12834\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6227\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/know-market-guess-free-selling-delivers-superior-profits.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"909\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469808000,"author_id":432,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5986,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Got a Job Offer? How to Best Negotiate Without Risking the Offer","link":"got-a-job-offer-how-to-best-negotiate-without-risking-the-offer","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Getting a job offer is a very exciting time. It often comes as a huge relief after a prolonged period of emotional and financial stress for you and your family. <br/>  </h3><p> It feels like a massive weight has been lifted from your shoulders. This is one of the reasons why so many of us mishandle this very important final step in the job search. We so badly want to secure the job that we are afraid to do anything that might make it go away. We rush to get the deal closed as quickly and quietly as we can because we just can&rsquo;t bear the thought of screwing it all up at this point. It&rsquo;s a completely understandable fear. Understandable &hellip; but unwarranted, and very bad for your career.</p><p> As a hiring manager, I have the opportunity to make job offers all the time. I&rsquo;ve also received a few offers myself over the years. I&rsquo;m surprised how consistently candidates either don&rsquo;t negotiate at all or approach the offer negotiation stage without a proper plan. If you&rsquo;re not completely comfortable with negotiations &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;re definitely not alone. Here are some tips I&rsquo;ve used over the years to get the most out of job offer negotiations without putting the offer itself at risk.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s start by making one very important first point: You should be negotiating 100% of the job offers you receive.</p><p> There is no scenario where not negotiating is okay. I realize it can be easy to convince ourselves that negotiating adds risk or might offend the future employer, and a host of other reasons to avoid it &ndash; but they are all wrong.</p><p> You need to negotiate your job offer.</p><p> There are two major reasons why this is the case. Reason number one is that if you don&rsquo;t negotiate, you&rsquo;re virtually always accepting the employers low ball offer. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve said something like, &ldquo;Okay so we&rsquo;ll offer 65K and take 70K if she counters &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Basically every offer is made with a contingency buffer of 5%-10%. You need to take advantage of this buffer or you&rsquo;re just leaving free money on the table.</p><p> The second reason you should always negotiate is that not negotiating sends a very bad message to your prospective manager.</p><p> As a hiring manager, I want my future staff members negotiating &ndash; it tells me they are serious professionals who know how to communicate their value and have the strength to fight for it.</p><p> There are so many practical applications of negotiation skill in almost any job whether it&rsquo;s negotiating priorities with internal teams or negotiating terms with a vendor or customer.</p><p> Negotiation is just a basic professional skill we all need to develop. In fact, each time I make an offer and the candidate doesn&rsquo;t negotiate, I worry if I&rsquo;ve hired the wrong person. That may sound a bit harsh, but it&rsquo;s true. The good news is if you negotiate correctly, you introduce almost no risk into the equation and reap all the benefits.</p><h3> Here are 4 basic rules I use to guide my job offer negotiations. Try them out next time you have the chance. <br/>  </h3><h3> 1.    Keep it friendly and constantly reaffirm interest <br/>  </h3><p> I first learned this valuable lesson when I was travelling in Egypt and Morocco after university.</p><p> The market vendors there have a magical way of negotiating extremely hard but making you feel good about it the entire time. A practical lesson you can take from that is to constantly reaffirm how excited you are about the job while you&rsquo;re asking for better compensation.</p><p> By contrast, one thing you should never do is use feigned reluctance as a bargaining tool. &ldquo;Playing hard to get&rdquo; is one of the absolute worst things you can do when negotiating an offer. When I counter an offer I find several occasions to reiterate just how much I want the role and just how perfect I think I am for the job. And I never use ultimatums.</p><p> You want to create an image in the mind of the employer that this is the perfect match for both parties and all that stands in the way of a win-win is a small concession. If you keep negotiations positive and avoid presenting ultimatums or binary decisions you never have to worry about the offer being pulled. This is vital to being able to negotiate with confidence.</p><h3> 2. Always present a package of options <br/>  </h3><p> Most compensation packages have several components to them and most employers have a variety of vehicles by which they can affect compensation.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a mistake to fixate on any one offer component when you negotiate. Too many of us focus too much on base salary.</p><p> For example, we will respond to a base salary offer of 50K with a base salary counter of 55K. The problem with this approach is twofold.</p><p> First off you haven&rsquo;t provided a very good opportunity for a win-win resolution to the negotiation by framing it as a binary decision i.e. either you give me exactly what I want or you don&rsquo;t. And secondly you aren&rsquo;t giving the employer enough flexibility to be able to easily accommodate your request.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> By making the offer decision binary you&rsquo;ve painted the employer into a corner. This is level one negotiating. Level two negotiating is about creating a package of negotiation points so the employer can pick and choose and customize a revised offer that gives everyone a chance to win. For example, rather than the counter a base salary of 50K with 55K, I would say something like:</p><p> Thank you very much for the offer. I am extremely excited for the opportunity to work with the company and I&rsquo;m confident I can make an immediate and positive contribution. In terms of compensation specifically, I&rsquo;m hoping we can find a way to create a package that is more in line with my skills and experience, and that can work for everyone. I would very happily execute an offer that contained the following amendments:</p><li> Base Salary: $52,500</li><li> Annual Performance Bonus: $5,000</li><li> Sign on Bonus: $2,500</li><p> By presenting a package like this you've done a bunch of very good things.</p><p> First off you&rsquo;ve given yourself a chance at the home run i.e. that they give you everything you&rsquo;ve asked for, which in this case goes far beyond the 5K increase you would have otherwise requested.</p><p> Secondly, most of the increase you've asked for is in the form of bonuses which are contingent on you achieving a certain level of success. This takes the risk out of the equation for the company and gives you the chance to earn more money.</p><p> Lastly, this gives the employer the chance to reject parts of your counter while still giving you a win i.e. They can reject the sign-on bonus and the base salary and you still end up with 55K or they can reject the performance bonus and you also end up with 55K. There are many more paths to success with this approach.</p><p> One final detail to mention &ndash; notice in my example message that I don&rsquo;t position this counter offer as an ultimatum. I only say how happy I would be execute the offer if certain things were amended. I make no mention at all of what I might do if they don&rsquo;t acquiesce. This allows me to stay confident in my negotiation strategy and not worry that they might walk away. My worst case in this scenario is that they&rsquo;ll say no to the changes I proposed and I&rsquo;ll have to stick with the original offer. Whereas if I had framed it as &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t accept this offer because of xyz,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d be introducing a bunch of risk into the equation unnecessarily. Stay positive and don&rsquo;t make ultimatums.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 3. Never &hellip; ever negotiate vacation time <br/>  </h3><p> I won&rsquo;t spend too much time on this one but it&rsquo;s something I feel quite passionately about. You are much better off negotiating for more salary or bonus or stock options than negotiating on vacation.</p><p> People who negotiate for more vacation send a very clear message that have a poor work ethic. I&rsquo;ve had several occasions where I chose one candidate over another solely based on this point. Do not, under any circumstance negotiate your vacation time &ndash; find something else to ask for.</p><h3> 4. Don&rsquo;t negotiate live or over the phone <br/>  </h3><p> This is another one I personally feel strongly about though I&rsquo;m sure some people may disagree. I never negotiate live or over the phone if I can help it. The reason is I want to think very carefully about everything I say and ask for.</p><p> I want the benefit of time to consider an offer before countering and to craft my response in the best way possible. Having to respond in real time presents too many opportunities for mistakes and doesn&rsquo;t give me the time I need to build a thoughtful counter offer. If I&rsquo;m presented with an offer in person or on the phone I&rsquo;ll just politely ask for 24 hours to speak to my spouse about it and then respond via email later.</p><p> An important point here is that I don&rsquo;t ask for time to &ldquo;think it over&rdquo; because that sounds too negative &ndash; like maybe I don&rsquo;t want the job after all. I prefer to ask for time to speak with my family about it because that is a perfectly reasonable thing to request and sends no negative message whatsoever.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-28 17:34:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-28 17:34:15.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_JFKxZSi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/got-a-job-offer-how-to-best-negotiate-without-risking-the-offer/\", \"post_id\": \"12837\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-28 17:34:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-28 17:34:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"got-a-job-offer-how-to-best-negotiate-without-risking-the-offer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12836\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6228\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/got-job-offer-how-best-negotiate-without-risking-offer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"732\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1469818800,"author_id":74,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5989,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Digital HR Can Help Attract and Retain Talent","link":"how-digital-hr-can-help-attract-and-retain-talent","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Growing a sustainable advisory business relies heavily on acquiring and retaining talent. With many key business processes undergoing a technological transformation, can digital HR keep up with the pace of this evolution?</h3><p> <br/> In fact,  <a href=\"http://www.workforce.com/2015/02/27/talent-management-orientation-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CEOs are counting on their HR staff </a>  to do just that, reports  Workforce . &ldquo;As CEOs try to figure out how to adapt their talent strategies, they will rely on HR leaders to guide their path&mdash;but only if HR can demonstrate how their talent management programs can deliver measurable business benefits,&rdquo; the publication writes.</p><p> According to PricewaterhouseCooper&rsquo;s 17th annual global CEO survey, 93 percent of CEOs said they recognize the need to change their talent strategies. At the same time, almost two-thirds of them have failed to make those changes.  Why? Because, according to the survey, &ldquo;only 34 percent of CEOs feel that HR is well prepared to capitalize on transformational trends, and 9 percent say it is not prepared at all,&rdquo; Workforce  writes.</p><p> &ldquo;HR needs to become digital to attract, retain and engage talent in a digital world,&rdquo; writes Jan Brouwer, Capgemini&rsquo;s senior vice president for HR Transformation, in his presentation,  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/capgemini/creating-value-with-digital-hr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Creating Value With Digital HR </a> . This falls into four main areas:</p><li> Talent acquisition</li><li> Talent management</li><li> Engagement</li><li> Compensation and benefits <br/>  </li><p> To become digital, HR functions need to take advantage of the same technologies as the rest of the company. Take mobility. While some people still apply for jobs via a desktop computer, many use a tablet or a smartphone. &ldquo;Some 28 percent of Americans&ndash;including 53 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds&mdash;have used a smartphone in one way or another as part of a job search,&rdquo; reports the Pew Research Center in its study <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/11/19/searching-for-work-in-the-digital-era/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Searching for Work in the Digital Era </a> . Job websites, as well as the job application itself, need to support mobile users, writes Luke Siuty for  Workforce.</p><p> &ldquo;Job seekers are increasingly using digital channels and devices to search for jobs,&rdquo; Brouwer writes. &ldquo;An organization&rsquo;s presence across digital channels has a strong impact on job seeker preferences.&rdquo; At the same time, companies can use digital channels to help define and enhance the corporate brand, which makes it easier to  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/4-reasons-youre-having-trouble-hiring-techies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  attract talent in a competitive world </a> , he adds.</p><h3> Taking advantage of technology</h3><p> <br/> And just like corporate and customer apps need to be as easy and intuitive as people&rsquo;s personal apps, HR apps do as well,  <a href=\"http://www.bersin.com/uploadedFiles/011416-predictions-2016-final2.pdf?aliId=74842429\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  according </a>  to Bersin by Deloitte lead author Josh Bersin in the  Predictions for 2016  research report. &ldquo;It is our job to design HR apps (e.g., recruiting, onboarding, learning, performance, feedback, communication, time and attendance, expenses, payroll, etc.) that are as easy to use as Facebook or Instagram,&rdquo; he declares. &ldquo;You should be thinking &lsquo;all of my HR programs are apps.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> Thinking of HR functionality in the context of applications makes it easier to think of them in terms of process and workflow. Perhaps more than any other department, HR depends on document-driven processes to get things done. Core HR functions that can be improved with  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/ecmblog/what-is-hr-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HR automation </a>  include:</p><li> <strong>  Timesheets </strong> . Send regular reminder emails for employees to review their timesheets</li><li> <strong>  Benefits </strong> . Track when employees become eligible for benefits enrollment</li><li> <strong>  Health and safety </strong> . Send update emails to floor monitors when an employee leaves the organization or moves to a new floor</li><li> <strong>  Employee recruitment </strong> . Automatically store applications submitted online and assign them to a recruiter for review</li><li> <strong>  Employee onboarding </strong> . Send confidentiality agreements, waivers and other forms to new hires and store them once completed</li><li> <strong>  Tax forms </strong> . Facilitate the distribution of W2s and other tax documents with employee email reminders</li><li> <strong>  Employee records management </strong> . Retain employee records according to government regulations <br/>  </li><p> HR is also starting to take advantage of human resources management software built on technologies such as analytics, big data, and the Internet of Things for functions ranging from understanding why employees are stressed to predicting which potential future employees might be ready to leave their current employers, Bersin writes. &ldquo;Today we measure retention, turnover, compensation, and quality of hire,&rdquo; he writes. &ldquo;Soon we will measure people&rsquo;s social networks, their behaviors, their locations, and maybe even their heartbeats.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Building a culture of continuous improvement</h3><p> <br/> And in the same way that developers are moving from waterfall to agile, organizations are also moving away from  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/performance-reviews-youre-fired/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  traditional once- or twice-yearly performance evaluations </a>  to programs of continuous improvement.  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/04/reinventing-performance-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  In a public survey  </a> Deloitte conducted recently, more than half the executives surveyed (58 percent) believe that their current performance management approach drives neither employee engagement nor high performance.</p><p> Companies that have eliminated annual performance reviews include Accenture, Adobe, Deloitte, the Gap, KPMG, Medivo, and Microsoft&mdash;altogether, about six percent of Fortune 500 companies.</p><p> In fact, 45 percent of HR leaders said they believe annual performance reviews are not an accurate appraisal of an employee&rsquo;s work, Brouwer writes. Instead, organizations are moving to digital tools such as crowdsourcing to develop more accurate perceptions of employees, according to the Capgemini study, Using Digital Tools to Unlock HR&rsquo;s True Potential .</p><h3> Improving engagement</h3><p> <br/> The other side of the employee performance evaluation coin is employee engagement. Engaged employees are motivated employees, and  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/want-to-keep-your-employees-keep-them-happy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  employees that stick around </a>  even in a competitive market. Consequently, HR departments are looking for ways to measure and improve employee engagement, Bersin writes, with 86 percent of companies rating culture and engagement a top priority in 2015, he adds. Similarly, &ldquo;workplace culture and behaviors&rdquo; came in second only to &ldquo;focusing on pipeline of future leaders&rdquo; as something CEOs were changing to attract and retain talent, according to  <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2016/landing-page/pwc-19th-annual-global-ceo-survey.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  PricewaterhouseCooper&rsquo;s 19  th   global CEO survey </a> .</p><p> So in the same way that the annual performance review is going away in favor of continuous improvement, the annual employee survey is too. &ldquo;Pulse survey tools, anonymous social networking tools, sentiment analysis tools, and a variety of culture assessment models are now available to help,&rdquo; Bersin writes. &ldquo;The trend is toward letting employees &lsquo;Like&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yelp&rsquo; things at work&mdash;and this process gives us valuable data about work practices, safety situations, customer service issues, and, of course, management.&rdquo;</p><p> In fact, in the same way that the CIO can shift from being the &ldquo;chief infrastructure officer&rdquo; to &ldquo;chief innovation officer,&rdquo; using technology to upgrade HR can move the HR officer from essentially administrative tasks to being a real partner in  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/07/people-before-strategy-a-new-role-for-the-chro\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  unleashing a company&rsquo;s human capital </a> , write Ram Charan,   Dominic Barton, and Dennis Carey in  Harvard Business Review .</p><p> Ultimately, these developments mean that a digital HR will be working with employees the same way that organizations as a whole endeavor to work with their clients: gaining information about them to better gauge their needs and respond to their wishes. The goal, then, is that the company will be rewarded, whether it&rsquo;s with good investment strategies or productive employees.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   If you&rsquo;re interested in learning how HR processes can be digitized, check out this   </u> </strong> <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/resource/ebook-ultimate-guide-hr-automation/?utm_source=text&amp;utm_medium=simplicityblog&amp;utm_campaign=Digital-HR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <strong>   free eBook on HR automation  </strong> </a> <strong>  <u>   .  </u> </strong></p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-31 11:17:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-31 11:17:53.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/how-digital-hr-can-help-attract-and-retain-talent.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-digital-hr-can-help-attract-and-retain-talent/\", \"post_id\": \"12844\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-31 11:17:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-31 11:17:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-digital-hr-can-help-attract-and-retain-talent\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12843\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6231\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-digital-hr-can-help-attract-and-retain-talent.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1107\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470045600,"author_id":480,"chart_url":""}

Most sales reps get a prospect on the phone and then go through a long winded presentation, seldom checking in, and then at the end vaguely asking for the order with a weak statement like:</p><p> &ldquo;So what do you think?&rdquo;</p><p> A client of mine once described his sales team as &ldquo;spraying and praying.&rdquo;  They &ldquo;sprayed&rdquo; a long presentation, and then at the end &ldquo;prayed&rdquo; the prospect was onboard and wanted to buy.</p><p> If that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re doing it now, then you know how sick of a feeling it is to finally ask for the deal (and usually be turned down).</p><p> Top producers handle this in a very different way.  First, top producers get much better quality leads out because they follow Top Characteristic Number Four of fully qualifying their leads.</p><p> Next, when they get a prospect back on the phone, before they jump into their demo or presentation, they take the time up front to requalify their prospect so there are no surprises when it comes to asking for the sale at the end.</p><p> What they are requalifying for are things like decision making ability of the person they are pitching, the timeline for making the decision (especially using a trial close like: &ldquo;And if at the end you like what you see today, is this something you can move forward with?&rdquo;), and any other qualifying areas that weren&rsquo;t covered during the qualifying call.</p><p> Here is a list of some sample questions you can ask at the beginning of your presentation:</p><p> &ldquo;I know you mentioned last time that you were particularly interested in learning about ________.  Is there any other area you wanted to see today?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;You mentioned that you were the one who would decide on something like this &ndash; is that still the case?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;I know you said you wanted to find a solution as soon as possible, so let me ask you: if this is everything you&rsquo;re looking for, are you prepared to move on this today?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;You know ________, we talked about the range of investment being between $10,000 to $50,000 depending on which program you went with.  If you do like this today, what kind of commitment are you thinking of making?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy we have some time to go over how all this works and let me ask you: If after you see all this you agree this is what you&rsquo;re looking for, is this something you can give me the go ahead to put to work for you today?&rdquo;</p><p> If some of these questions seem daunting to you, it&rsquo;s probably because you haven&rsquo;t been thoroughly qualifying your prospects to begin with.  You may be more used to the &ldquo;spray and pray&rdquo; model. </p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> I&rsquo;m here to tell you that you&rsquo;ll close more deals, avoid more frustration, and confidently close more deals if you begin requalifying your prospects up front. </p><p> The benefits of doing this are many.  To start with, if you find that a prospect isn&rsquo;t going to make a decision at the end but rather has lots of concerns or objections already, then you can adjust your pitch accordingly.  You can shorten it or ask for their main interests points and address those first.  Then after you&rsquo;ve answered any questions, you can begin overcoming some of the obstacles or ascertaining if this is a prospect who is ever going to close or not.</p><p> If you find that most of your prospects aren&rsquo;t going to make a decision at the end of your presentation, then you can go back to your qualifying script and put in more definite questions so you get better qualified leads for your next closes.</p><p> On the other hand, if you find out that your prospect is indeed ready to go, then you can use more tie downs and trial closes during your presentation and then confidently ask for and get the sales sooner. </p><p> Either way, you&rsquo;ll know where you stand at the beginning of your pitch and what you&rsquo;ve got to do to win the deal.</p><p> Take some time this week to restructure the opening of your presentation or demo and put some of the requalifying questions you&rsquo;ve read above.  Or, adapt some of your own.  The more you ask these kinds of questions, the stronger of a closer you&rsquo;ll become.</p><p> And one last note: Don&rsquo;t be afraid that you&rsquo;re going to scare off buyers by doing this.  Know one thing: buyers will respond to these kinds of questions.  Only non-buyers will give you trouble, and wouldn&rsquo;t you rather know up front who is going to buy and who isn&rsquo;t?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-31 11:29:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-31 11:29:22.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_B8FkPVc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-need-to-take-some-time-to-restructure-the-opening-of-your-sales-presentations/\", \"post_id\": \"12846\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-31 11:29:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-31 11:29:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-need-to-take-some-time-to-restructure-the-opening-of-your-sales-presentations\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12845\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6232\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-you-need-take-some-time-restructure-opening-your-sales-presentations.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"546\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470052800,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

Offering a simple, automated investment platform at rock-bottom fees, robo advisors have caused a massive stir in the wealth management industry in recent years. Growth has accelerated, as robo advisors sign up new consumers and gather more assets. At the same time, there has been a fascination around the future of robos in the advisory channel. Would robo advisors challenge the traditional human advisor&mdash;or would these digital advisory platforms be an ally for creating greater value?</p><p> The  <a href=\"https://www.jeffnat.com/knowledge-bank/articles/advisor-authority-the-innovation-and-issues-that-rias-and-fee-based-advisors-care-about-most/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2015 Advisor Authority Study </a> , conducted by Jefferson National and Harris Poll, found that advisors who managed the most assets and who earned the most personal income are the most tech-obsessed. They are far more likely to leverage robos, spend more on technology overall, and adopt technology into their practice at twice the rate of the typical advisor. For these advisors using technology is key to enhance the client experience on the front end, and create a more efficient and scalable practice on the back end.</p><p> Now, as more advisors are going robo, at the same time that more robo advisors are turning their attention from consumers to the advisory channel, we have seen a corresponding trend in the robo space: consolidation and acquisition.</p><h3> <b>  INEVITABLE CONSOLIDATION </b></h3><p> <br/> Over the past year, the top three independent robo advisors by AUM &mdash; Betterment, Wealthfront and Personal Capital &mdash; more than doubled their combined assets from roughly $3.8 billion at the end of 2014, to roughly $7.9 billion at the end of 2015. An impressive growth rate for a business model predicated on building a broad base of clients with relatively low balance accounts. Interestingly, the 2015 Advisor Authority Study found that advisors who use robo-advice are employing the tools for older, wealthier clients &mdash; contrary to popular belief.</p><p> As any industry matures, consolidation is inevitable. For financial services broadly, and for robos in particular, there are a various forces at work:</p><li> <strong>  Insatiable Demand for Innovation: </strong> Consumer demands shift and evolve at a faster rate than ever before. Now,  <i>  speed of information and immediate access have become a prerequisite </i> , largely driven by technology companies like Apple, Google and the many on-demand services that are changing the &ldquo;user experience.&rdquo; But few startups have the capital required to continuously meet the market&rsquo;s demand for ongoing innovation. Instead, most robos must turn to a partner with deep pockets to stay ahead of the game.</li><li> <strong>  Acquisition is Pervasive: </strong> Since its launch in 1985, Google has acquired nearly 200 companies. Facebook has acquired more than 50 companies over the past decade. Likewise, many larger players in the financial services industry&mdash; such as custodians, discount brokers, wirehouses, banks, asset managers and TAMPs looking to bolster their user experience and digital asset management capabilities &mdash; consider robo advisors attractive targets. It&rsquo;s inevitable that many of today&rsquo;s robos will be purchased &mdash; or perish.</li><li> <strong>  The DOL Fiduciary Ruling:  </strong> This could be the year that demand for robos takes off. The new ruling has propelled a shift from a commission-based sales to a fee-based compensation model. To be compliant with the new rule, while confronting  downward pressure on fees, some of the largest RIAs, wealth managers, broker dealers, wirehouses and banks will look to incorporate robo advice &ndash; whether licensing existing robo services or buying them outright.</li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <b>  CONSOLIDATION TREND </b></h3><p> <br/> Now two trends are converging: first, larger players are increasingly seeing the benefit of a digital wealth advisory platform; second, robo advisors have started to see that their future lies in playing nice with the traditional human advisor. Both of these trends converge in the acquisition and consolidation of digital wealth platforms. A recent webinar by Aite Group &mdash;  <i>  10 Trends in Wealth Management, 2016: From Digital Advice to Regulation &mdash;  </i> examined the importance of both trends:</p><p> <strong>  Incumbents Turned Disruptors: </strong> While initially slow to recognize the robo opportunity, larger institutions are now taking the lead and disrupting their own industry. As they verticalize their operations, these institutions are beginning to build their own in-house robo platforms, acquire smaller players, or partner up. These include BlackRock&rsquo;s acquisition of FutureAdvisor, Envestnet&rsquo;s acquisition of Finance Logix, and Fidelity&rsquo;s partnership with Betterment (prior to building their own robo, Fidelity Go). The focus of these industry acquisitions is changing. Once viewed primarily as revenue-generators, now acquisitions focus more on improving the user experience.</p><li> <strong>  Shifting to Advisors: </strong> Many robo advisors have recognized that the future of the advisory industry is neither solely digital nor a human-only &mdash; but rather a mix of human touch and digital experience. Betterment, for example, has seen an opportunity working with advisory firms through programs like Betterment Institutional and Betterment 401(k). Other robos are also moving in that direction. SigFig is phasing out direct-to-consumer distribution to focus on the advisory channel, and Jempstep made the transition from retail investors to institutions, and was promptly acquired by Invesco. <br/>  </li><h3> <b>  WHO WINS? </b></h3><p> <br/> So what will be the end result once the dust settles on the recent wave of acquisitions and consolidation?</p><p> It demonstrates how the industry&rsquo;s focus on the consumer&rsquo;s best interests and preferences is driving positive change in wealth management. In order to create the best value for their clients, advisors are focusing on the entire user experience, to create a more fulsome and holistic approach to advice that takes into account how it  <i>  looks, feels and adds value </i> . Robo advisors and other technology companies across the industry, such as data aggregators, CRM platforms, portfolio risk platforms and rebalancing tools, are a means to achieve the goals of improving the client experience and differentiating the advisor&rsquo;s offering.</p><p> Ongoing innovation in financial services continues to grow at a pace that has never been seen before. The beneficiary will be the advisor and the consumer. In the end, technology is no replacement for holistic guided financial advice. And as clients build more wealth, their need for guided advice only continues to grow. But as the rapid pace of consolidation and acquisition across the industry leads to the adoption of these digital advisory platforms by a growing number of advisors and their clients, they may find that bridging the robo divide helps them become more connected than ever before. </p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-31 11:52:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-31 11:52:09.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_fQNpYuB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-robos-see-that-their-future-lies-in-playing-nice/\", \"post_id\": \"12848\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-31 11:52:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-31 11:52:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-robos-see-that-their-future-lies-in-playing-nice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12847\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6233\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/advisors-robos-see-their-future-lies-playing-nice.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1180\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470038400,"author_id":355,"chart_url":""}

You've probably heard that term, maybe from HR, maybe from company leaders. But why does something like having organizational values matter for your company? Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t start a road trip without a map, right? The clearer a goal is, the better the chance that it will be achieved.</h3><p> <br/> Your company values are the foundation of the organization&rsquo;s identity. They&rsquo;re the concepts and qualities that your company considers most important. Strong organizational values shape the perspective, behaviors, and priorities of everyone who works there, from top leaders on down.</p><h3> Your Company&rsquo;s North Star</h3><p> Organizational values help you define who you are &mdash; to your staff, to the people investing in your business, and even to yourself. They shape your culture and create a self-defined standard for you to hold yourself accountable to. Like your own navigational fixed point, they help you make decisions:</p><li> Hiring and firing decisions</li><li> Business expansion decisions</li><li> Day-to-day decisions <br/>  </li><p> When something has you stuck, you can refer back to your own values and mission to see which of your options holds true to your beliefs.</p><p> Sadly, not everyone in the workplace has this guide. Our  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/resources/employee-engagement-survey-2013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2013 Engagement Survey </a>  found that only 42% of employees can say that they know their organization&rsquo;s vision, mission, and values. Less than half the workforce knows what they should be working toward at their company every day.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s not just employees&rsquo; fault for not knowing. 39% of employees polled by  <a href=\"http://blessingwhite.com/research-report/2013/01/01/employee-engagement-research-report-update-jan-2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  BlessingWhite </a>  say their senior leaders don&rsquo;t act in accordance with a company&rsquo;s guiding principles. So workers aren&rsquo;t getting a strong message about what their organization&rsquo;s values are. In the meantime, they&rsquo;re still doing essential work for the company . . . but it might not be done in the way that would best serve the company&rsquo;s vision.</p><p> Wouldn&rsquo;t you want your employees&rsquo; decisions to be directed by your most important principles and ideas?</p><h3> Boosting Employee Happiness</h3><p> <br/> In our  <a href=\"http://www.tinyhr.com/2015-tinypulse-best-industry-ranking-report?__hstc=225544837.3526daa8d89fa2757eeb70994ed08b25.1468173224980.1469533286240.1469967790244.7&amp;__hssc=225544837.2.1469967790244&amp;__hsfp=3644121245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2015 Industry Ranking Report </a> , we found that workers in construction and facilities services industry ranked number one out of all industries for employee happiness. We took a look at how employees in this sector responded to one of the TINYpulse questions: &ldquo;Do you feel our company values are aligned with your values?&rdquo; Their answers make it clear that sharing values with your company and your coworkers makes you happier on the job:</p><p> &ldquo;The company values have a customer-centric mindset as do I. Our challenge is how to effectively provide superior customer service and communication from a process-driven place.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I share the values of the company in my personal life. That is one of the things that make it very easy to love working here.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;One of the most satisfying things about working here is the close alignment of the company values to my own. That my peers overwhelmingly share the same values is icing on the cake.&rdquo;</p><p> What&rsquo;s more, neuroscience supports the connection between organizational values and happiness.Stanford University&rsquo;s Jamil Zaki conducted research on how people&rsquo;s values relate to being part of a group, and here are some of the most interesting ideas for company leaders.</p><li> <strong>  Social connection: </strong>  It&rsquo;s important to us that our values are shared by the rest of our social group. In Zaki&rsquo;s research, people who were told that their opinions were the same as the rest of the group experienced a reward response in their brains.</li><li> <strong>  Shifting values: </strong>  Zaki also found that if a person learned that their value judgments were different from their peers, they shifted their opinions closer to the group&rsquo;s. In other words, social connections can actually change a person&rsquo;s values. So company values help by giving them a shared set of values to agree upon. <br/>  </li><h3> Boosting Employee Retention</h3><p> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve brought in the right talent with your company values, they&rsquo;ll want to stick around too. A  <a href=\"http://www.hr.com/en?t=/Default/gateway&amp;application=blog&amp;elementID=1256841503798\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  study by Right Management </a>  found that employees&rsquo; commitment to their company&rsquo;s values is a key driver of their engagement. It&rsquo;s no surprise, since people need meaningful work in order to feel engaged. A series of tasks with no connection to a wider company identity is not going to inspire an employee&rsquo;s commitment. But feeling like you&rsquo;re together on the same mission can be deeply fulfilling.</p><p> So organizational values can help you recruit and retain happy, engaged employees who know how to play their part in achieving your company mission.

But I&rsquo;ve done enough diagnosing, supporting, and helping to transform careers over the years that I&rsquo;ve seen some consistent patterns. Don&rsquo;t get stuck in these common traps.</p><h3> <strong>  <strong>   1. Relentless Self Promotion  </strong> </strong></h3><p> <br/> The minute people begin to think you&rsquo;re more interested in your career than the organization&rsquo;s mission you&rsquo;re sunk. Do great work, find a sponsor, and stop tooting your own horn.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Non Stop Energy </strong></h3><p> <br/> Everyone loves a go-getter, do-it-all-fast kind of guy&ndash;at the frontline and middle manager level. But the time I spend in the C-Suites across a variety of industries reinforces what I&rsquo;ve believed for a long time. Energy and intensity are great, but if you want to play with the big guys project an aura of calm, cool-headed control.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Keeping Your Head Down </strong></h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;re so focused on your team and your team&rsquo;s results you miss the bigger picture. Work on strengthening your peripheral vision.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  4. Competing With Peers </strong></h3><p> <br/> Real leadership takes more than being consistently at the top of the stack rank. Winning Well leaders know the important balance of results AND relationships. If it&rsquo;s unlikely your peers will want to crack open some bubbly with you when you get that big promotion, chances are you may never get the chance to know.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Inability to Let it Go </strong></h3><p> <br/> Tenacity is one thing. But as they say, when the horse is dead, get off. Sometimes the answer is no, and you need to let it go. Winning Well leaders learn when to keep trying and when it&rsquo;s time to move on (at least for the time being).</p><h3> The Inspiration For This Post</h3><p> <br/> One of my favorite clients has been using my Results That Last: 7 Roles Every Manager Must Master  program as the foundation for his mentoring circle work. Each week, they go through one module together, discuss the content and tools, and then they each go off and do the exercise with their teams before meeting again to review the next module.</p><p> Sometimes he brings in internal executives as guest speakers who are particularly good in the role they will be discussing that day. He&rsquo;s also doing the 360 degree feedback tool twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the program. I love the approach, and he&rsquo;s seen a significant lift in business metrics. (If you want to learn more how you can use the course in this way, or other creative approaches, please call me on 443.750.1249.)</p><p>  As various questions comes up, he&rsquo;s been batting them my way for additional perspective. I was intrigued by the one that came up last week.</p><p> If we were coaching a person that has been a supervisor or leader for 10 plus years &hellip; What has held them back?  What characteristics have they been missing or overlooked? What haven&rsquo;t they done that others have?  (The road map is not paved or golden? Or is it?)</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-31 12:34:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-31 12:34:18.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_33bTEqB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-behaviors-that-keep-you-from-getting-promoted/\", \"post_id\": \"12851\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-31 12:34:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-31 12:34:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-behaviors-that-keep-you-from-getting-promoted\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12850\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6235\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-behaviors-keep-you-getting-promoted.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"420\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470078000,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5994,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Leadership Skills That Require Zero Talent","link":"10-leadership-skills-that-require-zero-talent","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I am an avid crossfitter and I am a leadership development coach. As of two weeks ago these were two separate aspects of my personality that did not cross over, until&hellip;</p><p> &hellip;I arrived at my crossfit gym one morning to see a &ldquo;Goals &amp; Gainz&rdquo; list on the board outlining 10 traits that required zero talent, all of which are proven leadership traits.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"277\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/goals-and-gains.png\" width=\"617\"/></p><p> It&rsquo;s common for new and established leaders to have moments of self-doubt and engage in social and professional comparisons. We live in a time when geniuses abound, but we have to remind ourselves that success often comes down to perseverance, not genius. It&rsquo;s about consistency and follow through. That&rsquo;s where the genius lies.</p><p> The skills to succeed aren&rsquo;t God-given; they aren&rsquo;t based on IQ or circumstance. They are skills anyone can acquire with practice. If you want to be rise to the stature of Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg then research their professional success and emulate them if need be.</p><p> Aspiring leaders and entrepreneurs can easily emulate the greats to develop their own leadership style that will push them to the top.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Being on Time </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can be as good at arriving on time as Richard Branson. This is a character trait that is so easy to accomplish and promotes respect for all parties involved. Chronic lateness does exactly the opposite.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Work Ethic </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> You can have the same work ethic as Marc Cuban. In fact most business icons have written books about their work ethic. Pick one up and research their routines. You will need to believe in the virtue of hard work. Even an early windfall or premature success will not sustain without the backbone of hard work to keep it going.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Effort </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can exert just as much effort as Bill Gates. The key is to be willing, and also to exert the right kind of effort so you don&rsquo;t waste your time. Effort separates most successful leaders from the rest of the pack. They do not stop and they work at their goals like there are 1,000 rumpelstiltskins trying to beat them at their own game.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Body Language </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can convey the same body language as Sheryl Sandberg. Study the greats and see how they communicate nonverbally. Get a coach if need be to see where you might need work on your communication. Nonverbal cues may not be the secret to propel you to the top but they can definitely hinder you from getting there. Some traditions take body language very seriously.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  5. Energy </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can harness the same energy as Oprah. While some of us might be born with a natural zest, it&rsquo;s easily attainable and just takes the right medicine: sleep, proper diet, meditation, exercise, and some fun. It&rsquo;s not rocket science; it&rsquo;s the natural consequence of living healthy.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> <strong>  6. Attitude </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can have the same attitude as Franklin Roosevelt. It may have to be cultivated if you don&rsquo;t have the leadership attitude to begin with, but you can get it if you want it. You can learn from a mentor and by emulating the greats. The more you emulate the more it becomes who you are.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Passion </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can have as much passion as Arianna Huffington. If you&rsquo;re doing what you love and aligned with your goals the passion will come if you want it. You have to want it though, or the passion lays dormant inside of you. Once you begin and keep going, the passion will grow.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Being Prepared </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can be as prepared as Roger Federer. Tennis players are a great example of preparation as they practice hitting drills for most of their lives so that when they are in a match they have the muscle memory to hit the shot the way they need to. They can then concentrate on where they want to hit the ball without worrying if they have the skill to execute it. Similarly, prepare yourself so you have the ingrained skills to execute your ideas.</p><h3> <strong>  9. Doing Extra </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can go the extra mile just like Barbara Corcoran grew Corcoran Realty into the empire it is. It&rsquo;s just a matter of doing it and not stopping. You always have a choice of doing or not doing. Choose doing and you&rsquo;ll see the fruits of your labor if you do a little more. Even when you&rsquo;re burnt out you probably have at least 20% more in you to give, if you&rsquo;re willing.</p><h3> <strong>  10. Being Coachable </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is where you make it or break it. Recognize there is no leader that has done it alone. Most leaders had someone &ndash; be it a mentor, a coach, a book, a role model &ndash; from whom they learned. Being Coachable is about cultivating curiosity and resisting the status quo bias, which urges you to keep things as they are. Read, learn, grow, evolve, keep an open mind, frame challenges as opportunities.</p><p> When jazz musicians are learning their craft they first learn &ndash; note for note &ndash; the solos of their idols. Once they have those solos under their belt they develop their own style, but they don&rsquo;t develop their own style until they&rsquo;ve first emulated the greats. Likewise, aspiring leaders and entrepreneurs can easily emulate the greats to develop their own leadership style that will push them to the top.</p><p> &ldquo;If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants&rdquo; &ndash; Isaac Newton.</p><p> The only talent required for any of these skills is the humility to accept that we all learn from those that came before us.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-31 12:48:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-31 12:48:26.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_VnZUCFN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-leadership-skills-that-require-zero-talent/\", \"post_id\": \"12854\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-31 12:48:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-31 12:48:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-leadership-skills-that-require-zero-talent\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12852\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6236\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/10-leadership-skills-require-zero-talent.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"888\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470060000,"author_id":156,"chart_url":""}

Her absence has me thinking about estate planning as it relates to children.</h3><p> <br/> When your children are young, it makes sense to divide your estate equally among them. However, as your kids get older and reach their 20s and 30s, you may discover that one child is more financially responsible than another. How does this affect your estate plan?</p><p> When creating your  <a href=\"http://www.nj.gov/state/dos_will_registry.html\" target=\"_blank\">  estate plan </a>  and deciding how your property and assets should be divided after you die, consider the following factors:</p><li> <strong>  Caregiver </strong>  &mdash; What if one child stuck around to take care of you later in life while your other children moved away? You may want to leave more to him or her since he or she sacrificed part of their life to take care of you.</li><li> <strong>  Life situations </strong>  &mdash; One child may be a single lawyer with few expenses while the other may have a large family to support on a modest salary. Should both children receive the same amount?</li><li> <strong>  Younger children may need more support </strong>  &mdash; Is there a drastic age disparity between your children? You may have older children who are independent adults and a younger child who is just broaching adulthood.</li><li> <strong>  Trust protection  </strong> &ndash; Ask yourself these questions: Are your children in rocky marriages? Are they in high risk professions? Are your children bad at handling money? Should my children receive their shares outright or would it be better to for them to receive their shares in a trust that will help protect them from themselves/divorce/creditors?</li><p> <br/> At the end of the day, no matter how you structure your plan, one thing is certain: you must inform your children &mdash; you do not want them surprised by your estate plan. In my experience, siblings are so distraught over the outcome of a  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  will </a> , they often seek a  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/12/left-out-of-the-will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  will contest </a>  when it could have been avoided by a conversation during the  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  testator </a> &rsquo;s lifetime.

It&rsquo;s only $100!&rdquo;</p><p> The startled desk clerk, Rosie, responds with the standard &ldquo;it&rsquo;s our policy&rdquo; schtick, but the guest isn&rsquo;t buying it at all.</p><p> &ldquo;Who wrote that policy? Do they understand customer service?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the clerk offers, &ldquo;the general manager is new. And I don&rsquo;t like his policies any more than you do. But I don&rsquo;t want to get in trouble.&rdquo;</p><p> The unrelenting guest continues, &ldquo;I want to speak with the general manager pronto.&rdquo;</p><p> Rosie suggests that she might be able to get the general manager to meet the now furious guest in the dining room. As the guest moves away, the panic stricken Rosie calls in for help from the front desk manager.</p><p> &ldquo;I have an unhappy guest, but I think I made it worse. I really said some stupid stuff about the boss and now the guest wants to speak with him.

But there was nothing really new. It was simply traditional media in a new wrapper &mdash; nothing new at all. We are now entering the era of &ldquo;new media.&rdquo; Media is now aggregated, not a place, a.k.a. the website destination is dead. People choose their media vs. being beholden to media schedules, formats or those who we &ldquo;should&rdquo; be listening to. Publishers are people, not oracles, and print is most certainly unsustainable, and therefore as good as dead. User-generated content, the democratization of content, publishing and the ability to share consume and publish anytime, anywhere is setting the stage for each and every one of us to be the center of our own media channel.</p><h3> The key is harnessing the power of social influence in a compelling way that connects authentic story-telling with brand and product interaction. </h3><p> <br/> This is a radical departure from the current media and eCommerce environment as consumers seek information when and where they want it vs. proceeding along a predictable purchase path.

Here's What To Do","link":"embarrassed-by-your-company-website-design-heres-what-to-do","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Your website exists for your customers. So, who does it serve when your customers search for your products or services and can&rsquo;t find your company website, or can&rsquo;t find what they&rsquo;re looking for when they do?</p><p> <strong>  For many businesses, website design is a passive task. Your team designs it once and it&rsquo;s checked off your to-do list. </strong>  But in a time when customers expect  <a href=\"http://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/tip/Customers-expect-increasingly-personalized-Web-experiences\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  increasingly personalized web experiences </a> , your website&rsquo;s outdated functionality and lack of helpful information sends prospective customers the signal that you aren&rsquo;t prepared to do business.</p><p> Even worse, it sends the signal that business is stagnant and not prepared to take on new business, which makes it even less appealing to work with you. After all, what thriving, modern business today doesn&rsquo;t update their website with new information on a regular basis?</p><p> <strong>  What can you do when your website is an embarrassment? </strong>  Take action. Here are three moves you should make when it&rsquo;s time to bring your company website design up to par:</p><h3> 1. Test your website with real people.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The best way to find out if your website design meets the needs of potential customers is to test the website with real customers. </strong>  You can do it manually by identifying 5-10 customers with great working relationships and asking them to participate in a website review, or you can use  <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  paid online tools </a>  that will organize the review for you ( <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-website-review-userisdrunk?__hstc=268771694.10dc17e19b2f01fe268a19ca623f98da.1458749375530.1468171061778.1469971639243.16&amp;__hssc=268771694.5.1469971639243&amp;__hsfp=3644121245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  but preferably not a drunk one </a> ). Either way, this test will allow you to make informed decisions based on impartial feedback.</p><p> Even if testing your website with real people is too technical or involved, you can improve what you say on your website by noting the questions and problems that your customers and prospects are facing. Are you talking more about your company or their issues? Seeking out an unbiased opinion or even a  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/marketing-opportunity-review\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  professional opinion </a>  can give you ideas you&rsquo;ve never thought of.</p><p> <strong>  Definitely don&rsquo;t:    </strong> Ask your friends to review your company website. Unless your friends happen to be your ideal target customer, the feedback you get may send you off course to meeting the needs of the people who won&rsquo;t purchase from your business anyway.</p><h3> 2. Budget incremental improvements to your website design.</h3><p> <br/> Very few of us would drive a car that had a flat tire for a day, let alone for a few months. So why would you expect your website to continue to generate new business for you if you invest nothing in maintaining it?</p><p> <strong>  In between complete overhauls  , all B2B companies need to invest in the following: </strong></p><li> Updating your content management system</li><li> Testing messaging on your homepage</li><li> Improving click rates from page to page and optimizing the conversion funnel (leading people down the path to becoming a sales opportunity)</li><li> Writing a company blog that answers common customer questions</li><li> Updating product/service information</li><li> Measuring response rates for automated email workflows or lead followups and optimizing them with better messaging</li><p> <strong>  Your website is an ongoing investment. </strong>  If you&rsquo;re delaying a major overhaul until a future point in time, that&rsquo;s fine, but you must invest time and money in incremental improvements as you go. Try a  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/growth-driven-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  growth driven design </a>  approach where you make small changes to your website &mdash; sometimes as little as one page at a time &mdash; and measure the improvements.</p><p> Also: Learn what a &ldquo;growth driven design&rdquo; approach is and how working on your website over time can actually make it less painful in the long run.</p><p> <strong>  Definitely don&rsquo;t: </strong>  Let your website design grow stale. Your website is not a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; marketing tool. Even the most advanced website design will need to be maintained and tweaked over the years to remain an effective sales tool.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 3. Consider planning for a new website design.</h3><p> <br/> The process of redesigning a website can be so painful that we once had a CEO tell us &ldquo;You can do marketing for us, just don&rsquo;t redesign our website.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. In fact, website redesigns should be a rewarding, positive project. The problem is that many companies try to cut costs by working with less-than-professional providers.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t let your fear of a bad experience keep you from investing in what your business needs. </strong>   <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/web-design-questionnaire\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ask the right questions </a>  during your planning to ensure your website will be a business development engine for your business.</p><p> Become familiar with the process so you know who needs to be involved when and how much time and effort is required on your team&rsquo;s part.</p><p> <strong>  Definitely don&rsquo;t: </strong>   Ask a neighbor, friend, boss&rsquo;s kid to redesign the website. If you want a professional website, work with a specialist with experience, like your in-house web designer or a professional website design agency. Anything less will leave you with an embarrassing redesign that will also cost you business.</p><p> <strong>  Your outdated website is pushing away prospects rather than attracting them, and you can&rsquo;t afford to leave it as it is. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Review these suggestions and ask yourself the tough questions. </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Is our website living up to potential?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What don&rsquo;t I know that I need to know?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Are my assumptions about the company website wrong?&rdquo;</p><p> It might be time to turn that embarrassing website into a business development machine.

However, when it comes to building a successful law firm, there are many attorneys still struggling to find that formula.</p><p> A recent post at Digital Marketer detailed  <a href=\"http://www.digitalmarketer.com/essential-business-questions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  three essential questions that every business must answer if they want to succeed </a>  and these questions certainly apply to the legal profession.</p><h3> Question #1: What value do you provide?</h3><p> <br/> We are not talking about your &ldquo;product&rdquo; &mdash; whatever type of law it is that you practice. We are not talking about your hopes and dreams for your practice because your clients do not care about that. We are talking about what kind of value you deliver to your clients. If someone hires you, what will they have tomorrow that they didn&rsquo;t have today? How will they feel after working with you? How will their lives or the things or people they care about be better because they hired you? These are the questions you must answer to articulate the value you bring to a working relationship with your clients.</p><h3> Question #2: Whom do you serve?</h3><p> <br/> The idea of practicing law to serve the ideal called &ldquo;justice&rdquo; may be noble but it will not put dinner on the table. The ideal you must serve is the client and you must organize your firm around your ideal client. Identifying and defining your ideal client will tell you who your target market should be.  Without knowing your target market, you are wasting money marketing to the universe of &ldquo;everyone.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Question #3: How will you say no?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not unusual for attorneys, especially those just starting out, to take on any client with a pulse. This is a mistake because you will work yourself and your staff to death on marginal business.</p><p> One of the biggest misconceptions is if you market like a specialist and niche your legal practice, your business is going to dramatically diminish. The truth is, when you niche your legal practice, you speak and communicate more powerfully to your ideal market than if you say you can help anyone and everyone.</p><p> Of course, there may be a few prospects you will no longer reach&hellip;but because you are stating a compelling reason why your ideal target should do business with you, your firm will begin to attract your ideal target market more powerfully.</p><p> This is exactly what you want. You want to attract the people or companies that are most likely to do business with you initially, repeatedly and at the highest profit margin.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-31 14:59:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-31 14:59:16.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_qPRBppG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-crucial-questions-your-law-firm-must-answer-to-succeed/\", \"post_id\": \"12867\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-31 14:59:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-31 14:59:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-crucial-questions-your-law-firm-must-answer-to-succeed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12866\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6242\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/3-crucial-questions-your-law-firm-must-answer-succeed.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"918\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470070800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Determine what is working, where you have holes in your plan, what you can focus on to improve your position and what potential threats exist that could waylay your success.</p><p> Increasing your awareness of potential financial threats to your goals needs to be a normal and regular part of your financial planning.  The impact of prolonged illnesses, divorce, death, legal liabilities, job loss, business downturns and other unanticipated events can shake your ability to move your life&rsquo;s mission forward in a strong and positive manner. But your active participation in the quantitative and qualitative (feelings) side of preparation can assist in making the best of a bad situation.</p><p> You should also include an understanding of your level of Emotional Intelligence, or EI, and work to improve and strengthen your resilience. Daniel Goleman&rsquo;s book,  Emotional Intelligence,  offers an important insight on EI and how vital it is in your life and your ability to navigate challenges. Consider the benefits of understanding and dealing with your capacity to recognize your own and other people&rsquo;s emotions and to discriminate between a variety of feelings and deal with them appropriately.  When life is smooth and easy, your EI, while important, doesn&rsquo;t even touch the scale of its importance when the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; hits the fan and chaos ensues. That&rsquo;s when a strong and well-developed level of emotional intelligence is so vital.</p><p> Combining your financial IQ with your emotional IQ provides a more rounded and appropriate view of your life from both a numbers perspective and a qualitative point of view. While you might have one or the other in alignment, not until both are working together do you have a heightened ability to deal with and resolve unexpected problems and challenges. Life rarely provides a written invitation to the next event, so your readiness is important and necessary.</p><p> Life&rsquo;s disruptions happen and are more manageable when you are properly prepared. The lack of proper preparation and readiness will leave you exposed to financial and emotional stresses and chaos.  Take a SWOT analysis of your financial and emotional life. Work with professionals who can help outline the possible threats and offer insights and suggestions that may help. Focus on your Emotional Intelligence to provide the balance and stability that is necessary during times of stress. Remember, you cannot prevent all unknowable or unforeseeable events from happening, but you can be better prepared!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-31 15:09:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-31 15:09:27.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/07/living-through-lifes-financial-disruptions.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/living-through-lifes-financial-disruptions/\", \"post_id\": \"12869\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-31 15:09:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-31 15:09:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"living-through-lifes-financial-disruptions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12868\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6243\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/living-through-lifes-financial-disruptions.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"642\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470042000,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6002,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Best Apps for Travel Hacks","link":"10-best-apps-for-travel-hacks","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Traveling has always been a &ldquo;fly by the seat of your pants&rdquo; kind of experience. You can plan, visualize and proceed cautiously, but nothing ever proceeds exactly the way you imagine.</h3><p> <br/> While travel is still inherently filled with guessing and uncertainty,  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/10-money-apps-conquer-your-finances-in-the-new-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the age of apps </a>  has made the experience much more manageable. What used to be done in the moment can now be handled ahead of time, and what used to require footwork now just requires a few taps on a touch screen.</p><p> So how can you embrace the digital age of traveling simplicity? Read on for some of my favorite travel apps.</p><p> 1.  <a href=\"https://citymapper.com/chicago/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CityMapper </a>  &ndash; This app will tell you the best way to get to your final destination without having to rely on expensive cabs. This is perfect for people who want to save money, but are confused by public transportation. It will also let you book an Uber directly from the app, if that ends up being your best option.</p><p> 2.  <a href=\"https://www.hoteltonight.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HotelTonight </a>  &ndash; Having trouble with your Airbnb? Maybe your hostel ended up getting bedbugs? If you&rsquo;re in a squeeze and need a place to stay, HotelTonight may be your savior. This app finds the best hotel deals right now and lets you book the hotel stay directly from the app. Need a room for tomorrow night too? Don&rsquo;t worry, you can now book a hotel up to seven days out.</p><p> 3.  <a href=\"https://www.hipmunk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hipmunk </a>  &ndash; Developed by one of the founders of Reddit, Hipmunk aggregates flights based on price and length. It allows you to set custom alerts so you can find the best time to book your particular flight and you can also set a departure city to find the best deals coming out of your particular area.</p><p> 4.  <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Airbnb </a>  &ndash; Once you have your destination, look for a place to stay using the Airbnb app. You can search based on your vacation time, amenities and reviews. Booking an apartment or house can be much cheaper than using a hotel, especially if you find one with a kitchen.</p><p> 5.  <a href=\"https://www.hopper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hopper </a>  &ndash; Finding the best deal on a flight can seem like pure luck, but that&rsquo;s where Hopper comes in. It tracks flight prices and alerts you when the lowest price is available. Unfortunately, this app is not available for Android yet, so only iPhone users can find the best deals.</p><p> 6.  <a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  WhatsApp </a>  &ndash; Staying in touch while you&rsquo;re abroad has gotten much easier. WhatsApp allows you to communicate with friends and family back home without paying roaming charges or needing access to a data connection.</p><p> 7.  <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/?exp=home_signup_form\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Uber </a>  &ndash; If you&rsquo;ve been abroad lately, you know the Uber craze is not limited to just the states. Getting an Uber abroad can be much cheaper than hailing a cab and easier than navigating your way around a foreign subway system.</p><p> 8.  <a href=\"http://www.gasbuddy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  GasBuddy </a>  &ndash; If you&rsquo;re taking a road trip, GasBuddy is your friend. Use the app to locate the cheapest gas station and estimate how much each trip will cost (the app asks you to input your car&rsquo;s make and model, your starting location and your destination).</p><p> 9.  <a href=\"http://www.hostelworld.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HostelWorld </a>  &ndash; Looking to get a really good deal on your accommodations? Try staying in a hostel. You can find your perfect choice using this app, where you can search for a bed in a private room or one with a dozen of your soon-to-be best friends.</p><p> 10.  <a href=\"https://www.kayak.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Kayak </a>  &ndash; This site is famous for helping people score great deals on flights and hotels, but did you know they have an app? They can help figure out the best ways to save money, such as purchasing two one-way flights instead of one round trip flight.</p><p> Ultimately there are a plethora of options available to streamline your travel planning. Just make sure to download and use these apps in advance of leaving on any trips, so you know how they work before you&rsquo;re stranded in Vienna one night. The more you can familiarize yourself with these apps, leverage them to save money, and to plan ahead, the better your trip will be.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-31 15:27:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-31 15:27:39.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_nfEYcly.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-best-apps-for-travel-hacks/\", \"post_id\": \"12871\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-31 15:27:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-31 15:27:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-best-apps-for-travel-hacks\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12870\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6244\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/10-best-apps-travel-hacks.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1013\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470078300,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6003,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Get to Yes With Millennials","link":"how-to-get-to-yes-with-millennials","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Despite some of the media hype, about the divide between Millennials and  their older colleagues at work, forging common ground is not a hopeless task or an expensive one. It does require willingness of both parties to address perceptions and stereotypes and engage in open conversation. I offer some advice for both Gen Y/Millennials and their managers.</p><h3> Among the common stereotypes, perhaps better termed &ldquo;perceptions,&rdquo; about Gen Y in the workplace are these, and I follow each with suggestions to reach workable solutions.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Stereotype/perception: Gen Y/Millennials (I will use the terms interchangeably)  don&rsquo;t have a good grasp of acceptable workplace behavior. </strong> Typical examples are inappropriate dress for a professional work environment, demeanor, not calling in when sick or coming in late, leaving cellphones on a desk unattended which ring and disturb others, etc.</p><p> Suggestions to avoid this stereotype : I advise employers to expand their customary orientation programs to include these issues and behaviors and lay out specific expectations from Day One. We design these sessions to both appeal to Gen Yers in language and spirit to hold their attention &ndash; and to be taken seriously.</p><p> The Gen Yer can also take the initiative by asking upfront about expectations at work or ask a parent, older sibling or mentor what&rsquo;s appropriate to avoid career threatening behaviors.</p><p> <strong>  Stereotype/perception:    Naturally drawn to the use of electronic media, Gen Yers have developed little discretion about appropriate communication media and styles to fit particular situations at work. </strong>   Regular use of texting or it&rsquo;s abbreviations for professional communications, bluntness, lack of care in spelling and punctuation creates a poor impression to older managers and clients, customers and others outside the peer group.   </p><p> Suggestions to avoid this stereotype : This is another subject for expanded orientation by management.</p><p> Suggested action on the Gen Yers part: Look for a mentor or coach in the organization to learn what is considered appropriate when and why. Quick and efficient is not always the better method to get desired results. Shift your focus to the other person&rsquo;s/receiver&rsquo;s point of view.</p><p> <strong>  Stereotype/perception  : Aptly nicknamed &ldquo;Generation Why,&rdquo; they ask a continuing stream of questions, often at inconvenient times for the recipient of the question who may be running off to a meeting, making a deadline or working intensely on a project etc. </strong> Sometimes it may be perceived as challenging a decision or authority.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Suggestions to avoid this stereotype : Asking questions is a good thing, and likely they were taught that. But be sure not to appear to be challenging a manager. Before asking the question, inquire if it is a convenient time.</p><p> I have counseled leaders and supervisors to set aside time for a regularly scheduled group session for questions to be raised and answered. Gen Yers like doing things in groups. They can get their questions out and feel listened to.</p><p> <strong>  Stereotype/perception  :    Gen Yers are said to be demanding of quick and frequent promotions and are thought to possess a poor work ethic &ndash; often by the same person. </strong> They don&rsquo;t like to do the same thing over again many times, thinking they have mastered the skill or job very quickly and deserve to be promoted to something more challenging &ndash; like team leader, VP or partner in two months. As to the work ethic perception, many Yers like to leave early and arrive on the late side in the morning. Actually, many Gen Yers are willing to work hard, but they want to work when and where they want to. They don&rsquo;t buy into the facetime concept.</p><p> Suggestions to avoid this stereotype : As a young employee, have reasonable expectations. If you are not challenged enough, ask for new projects where you can learn new skills. Or initiate. Suggest something to benefit the organization and volunteer to develop it.</p><p> <strong>  Stereotype/perception  :   Gen Yers are spoiled and over-protected by their &ldquo;helicopter parents.&rdquo; </strong> Only a relatively small percentage of parents actually exhibit extreme helicopter/hovering behavior such as showing up at job interviews, insisting on negotiating job offers or calling to complain to the employer about less than positive performance evaluations. However, that behavior is so inappropriate that it has gotten a lot of media attention .</p><p> Suggestions to avoid this stereotype:  Recognize that while asking parents for advice is often wise, that should take place behind the scenes. An employer wants to see that young employees can make their own decisions, take responsibility and are accountable. Keep your parents out of the workplace except when invited (and some employers are inviting parents these days), and don&rsquo;t talk with parents by phone several times a day at work.</p><p> Additional thoughts: I prefer to think first of the good stereotypes or characteristics attributed to Gen Y/Millennials: that they are eager to learn, ambitious, optimistic, tech savvy, altruistic, idealistic, family-oriented, seeking authenticity, appreciative of diversity and flexibility. Like their Boomer parents, with whom they tend to have good, close relationships, they want to change the world for the better. It&rsquo;s worth putting the time and effort in to come to &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  These mindset and behavioral issues can be solved with enlightenment about why it matters, what&rsquo;s in it for them (or WIFM), and how to change for harmonious outcomes that benefit the whole organization.</p><p> What would you add? Let me know what you have found to work best in these and similarly frustrating or disrupting situations.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-31 15:38:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-31 15:38:00.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder_NKKXU2V.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-to-yes-with-millennials/\", \"post_id\": \"12873\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-31 15:38:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-31 15:38:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-to-yes-with-millennials\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12872\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6245\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/how-get-yes-millennials.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"405\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470042000,"author_id":388,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6004,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Robo Advisors: Friend or Foe? Will Advisors Become Extinct?","link":"robo-advisors-friend-or-foe-will-advisors-become-extinct","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> A new generation of technology has some advisors worried about extinction <br/>  </h3><p> The robo advisor phenomenon is clearly gaining momentum across the industry, from the major brokerage firms and banks to standalone RIAs.</p><p> As this new technology-driven model is becoming more prevalent, advisors are beginning to question the impact of the new trend on their ability to grow, to service clients and to remain competitive.</p><p> For some, the robo advisor represents yet another source of competition and a potential threat to how an advisor&rsquo;s contribution is valued.</p><p> However, others will recognize the opportunities it creates: to gain wallet share and appeal to a new generation and/or type of client as well as to create a more scalable, replicable and profitable addition to the current way of doing business.</p><h3> Who, or what, is a robo advisor?</h3><p>  </p><p> The robo advisor refers to technology-based capabilities for providing investment and wealth management services.</p><p> While some robos are being launched to stand on their own, without the need for a relationship with an actual advisor, we believe that the most successful robos will be those whose advanced technology is integrated into traditional investment and wealth management platforms and in the hands of flesh and blood advisors. These robos will not replace but enhance the advisor-client relationship.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> For example, Sallie Krawchek has described her new robo platform Ellevest as a &ldquo;digital investment platform&rdquo; designed specifically for women. Her goal, in part, was to add a level of automation to creating financial and investing plans, while consequently better maximizing an advisor&rsquo;s time. As she noted in an article on ThinkAdvisor.com, it&rsquo;s not about replacing the human advisor, but rather about &ldquo;leveraging the brainpower of humans through technology.&rdquo;</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the catalyst for the robo movement? <br/>  </h3><p> No doubt that shrinking margins and fee compression have contributed to the development of the robo. The DOL rule and the overall shift towards a fiduciary philosophy are also creating a greater need for transparency with clients, including the question of costs.</p><p> Advisors will more routinely need to disclose and justify their fee structures, conversations that can easily lead to having to explain the value that they provide. Those who focus solely on acting as portfolio managers without incorporating some planning or more holistic thinking are likely to feel the most threatened by the robo.</p><h3> Is there a movement underway to replace human advisors with robo advisors? <br/>  </h3><p> The robo trend doesn&rsquo;t signal the end of the industry as we know it. People generally need and seek out advice and guidance from trusted professionals. The support and concern that comes from a genuine relationship with a living and breathing advocate can&rsquo;t be replicated by technology.</p><p> Certainly, a robo can learn by algorithm, provided the information gathering process is comprehensive enough, but they cannot &ldquo;experience&rdquo; the client&rsquo;s needs and goals the way a human advisor does. A robo can be helpful in formulating solutions, but not before a client&rsquo;s needs and goals are heard and understood.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> If you can&rsquo;t beat &rsquo;em&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> Barely a day goes by when the trade press doesn&rsquo;t mention a new robo being launched, and all of the major firms are expected to offer some type of robo platform, if they haven&rsquo;t done so already, in the coming year. So it&rsquo;s inevitable that advisors and their clients will &ndash; one way or another &ndash; be interacting with the robos over time. Those who embrace rather than reject the idea of using a robo will prevail.</p><h3> Next gen tools for next gen clients <br/>  </h3><p> Next gen clients are particularly intrigued by the robo platforms. They don&rsquo;t necessarily want &ndash; nor fully trust &ndash; their father&rsquo;s or grandfather&rsquo;s advisor or firm. What it often takes to capture the millennial or next gen client market is new and innovative technology.</p><p> Robo capabilities can be an effective and appropriate way to work with a client early in their careers or stage of wealth accumulation, and then be transitioned to a more full-service relationship as assets increase and circumstances become more complex.</p><h3> Befriending the robo <br/>  </h3><p> Fear aside, this new breed of technology creates an opportunity for advisors to add more service and stay relevant. Consider this: All advisors, to some degree, search for ways to optimize their businesses and add capacity.</p><p> High touch, service-oriented advisors benefit from incorporating technology solutions into their overall approach, allowing them to allocate their time in the most meaningful ways. Put another way, the robo can allow advisors to spend their time, on any given day, with those clients who require his personal attention while other tasks can be effectively handled in a &ldquo;digital way&rdquo;.</p><p> Advisors will need to incorporate &ndash; to some degree &ndash; this new breed of technology into their current investment and wealth management approaches if they are to remain relevant and stay competitive.</p><p> Technology itself can&rsquo;t replace the value of a personal relationship, and therefore can&rsquo;t replace a financial advisor. The robo can, however, enhance the value of the advice an advisor provides, as well as maximize their time and capabilities. It&rsquo;s not about win or lose.

I decided it&rsquo;s time to write how to go from stay-at-home mom to professional (again).</p><p> This is an updated version of a post I wrote several months ago as well as a new download. </p><h3> Clarify your motives <br/>  </h3><p> Honesty in the best policy in life and it&rsquo;s the very best approach here. Be honest with yourself regarding why this is necessary. Your motives set the tone for the remaining eleven steps. If you&rsquo;re going back to work simply because you need to the money to pay for your kids&rsquo; insanely expensive college tuitions, feel free to skip to step five. If you wish to build a life based on your purpose or at least enjoy work (for you), please read word for word.</p><h3> Give some thought to your passion <br/>  </h3><p> At this moment, you have a golden opportunity to focus on your passion and dreams. The best places to start is  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/first-thing-want-change-careers-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The First Thing To Do When You Want to Change Careers </a>  and  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/4-must-dos-to-fulfill-your-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  4 Must Do&rsquo;s To Fulfill Your Purpose </a> .</p><p> Take some time to evaluate what makes you truly happy. Make a list of what drives you and cite specific criteria regarding your must-haves, nice-to-haves, and really-nice-to-haves. Don&rsquo;t be concerned about how you&rsquo;ll make it happen. Just figure out the &ldquo;what&rdquo; first. You can also check out  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/figure-purpose-life-fewer-600-words/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  How to Figure Out Your Purpose in Life in Fewer Than 600 Words </a>  and  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/7-signs-you-found-your-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  7 Signs You Found Your Purpose </a> .</p><h3> Determine your short-term options <br/>  </h3><p> Let&rsquo;s speed up the process. You have three options. You can return to whatever profession you held previously,  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/5-requirements-for-a-successful-career-change/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  start a new profession with a company </a> , or  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235224\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  start your own company </a> . Everything else falls into those classifications if you desire compensation in exchange for your time. Don&rsquo;t laugh at the third option. It might be the most sensible option for many.</p><h3> Take steps toward your dreams <br/>  </h3><p> This is different than giving some thought to your passion. Once you know &ldquo;what&rdquo; you&rsquo;d like to do, narrow your research and efforts toward people, companies, volunteer opportunities, and other avenues that put you on track to get there. This is the &ldquo;how&rdquo; part. You don&rsquo;t need the entire formula. You just need to see the first step and I just gave it to you. Take a peek at  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/what-to-do-when-you-cant-get-the-job-you-want/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  What to Do When You Can&rsquo;t Get the Job You Want </a> . Don&rsquo;t let the title fool you. This is essentially where you are if you look at a map.

It&rsquo;s literally that simple. Been gone for ten or twelve years? No problem. You&rsquo;re smart. You&rsquo;re reading this blog post, so you know what a website is and how to Google stuff. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at what a few keyword searches will do. Seek current books, blogs, and whatever other resources you can find related to your field. Dive in. You can also take training or certification classes if applicable.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Organize and build your network <br/>  </h3><p> Unless you&rsquo;ve been a recluse and avoided every parent-teacher conference, you have a network and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s better than you think it is. Assemble your contacts in some organized fashion. Pull together your Facebook friends, LinkedIn contacts (join if you&rsquo;re not yet using the site), kids&rsquo; friends&rsquo; parents and so forth. Pay attention to who does what where (I meant for work not as the town gossip). Look for ways for your connections to help you. This is not a time to be bashful. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at how willing people are to help. </p><h3> Update your resume <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;ve written several articles on this subject and I strongly suggest checking out  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/build-ultimate-professional-resume-andrew-lacivita/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  How To Build The Ultimate Professional Resume </a> . It comes with a template you can fill in and video instructions. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. Yes. Highlight the activities you did while you were away from the workforce. If those activities were part-time, employment-related, place them toward the top (reverse chronological order with most recent on top). If they were volunteer-related, place them toward the bottom of the resume. It&rsquo;s extremely important to emphasize any activities such as Parent Teacher Organization or other programs in which you were involved.</p><h3> Build your LinkedIn profile <br/>  </h3><p> This activity is worth its own section. Fill in everything you possibly can and use the site to research companies and relationships you might have with current or former employees of those (target) companies. It&rsquo;s easy to find your former coworkers. You can also find those long-lost college friends. Heck, you can in some cases even find you old high school chums.

And, make sure to connect with me if you haven&rsquo;t already. I have a huge network, which means you&rsquo;re only a click and an email away from someone who can likely help you.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Read Interview Intervention <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;ll need to know how to interview for a job. Even those who&rsquo;ve never taken time away from the corporate grind don&rsquo;t interview often. Learn the most effective way to interview.</p><h3> Target companies <br/>  </h3><p> Whether you just need a job, just want any job, or want to pursue your dream career, you&rsquo;ll have much better luck if you target desirable companies. &ldquo;Desirable&rdquo; is debatable, but you need to cite opportunities giving you the best chance for success. This means you&rsquo;re identifying opportunities with companies where you have a personal relationship with someone who can help get you in the door or the company has a need for someone like you. Otherwise, you need to be willing to do whatever necessary to work at a company that supports your calling!</p><h3> Volunteer <br/>  </h3><p> I love when I can make an entire sentence out of one word. Yay. This is one of the very best ways to get connected and it&rsquo;s simple to find volunteer opportunities. You meet great people. Some of these volunteers will be corporate executives. Others will have spouses who might be influential. If nothing comes of this, you can take solace in the fact you did some good.</p><h3> Discuss with your spouse <br/>  </h3><p> Obvious, right? No. Agree what your ideal situation looks like. Agree what an acceptable situation looks like. This becomes even more complicated in situations when you&rsquo;re divorced or separated. The point is to make sure you know what your success factors and limitations are. Most importantly, make sure you support each other during this big change!</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 14:51:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 14:51:04.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_rHD0YVG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-go-from-stay-at-home-mom-to-professional-again/\", \"post_id\": \"12877\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 14:51:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 14:51:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-go-from-stay-at-home-mom-to-professional-again\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12876\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6247\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/How-to-go-from-stay-at-home-parent-to-professional.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"483\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470132000,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}

How to Retain a Widow or Heir After Your Client Dies","link":"embrace-resistance-how-to-retain-a-widow-or-heir-after-your-client-dies","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Research tells us that 90% of heirs will reject their parents advisors, and 70% of widows will change advisors after their husband's death. Can you afford that level of loss? <br/>  </h3><p> I thought through my coaching clients for the last 10 years and realized I have heard this excuse too many times.</p><p> I remember talking to a client and he was very upset. He had lost one of his largest clients. I asked him what happened and he said that the husband died and the spouse transferred her money to another advisor saying, You only talked to my husband when we came for our reviews.</p><p> How often do you lose the assets after your clients die? For those of you who are being honest with yourself, this happens a lot and you know it. But, the title of this article is solutions, not a mean coach opening up an old wound. So what do you do?</p><p> You learn how to talk to them or hire a professional. There are people out there who are trained in these issues and my client is a pro, in fact she is one of the chosen few who can handle really tough family issues; addiction, lifestyle issues, and entitlement issues. I have learned a lot about her technique over the time we have worked together and I wanted to share some of her insights. I would refer financial advisors to her in a moments notice.</p><h3> I asked her to give the top 10 things she could share without making all the advisors that read this guilty of practicing psychology without a license. Here is what she said: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Define Your Client <br/>  </h3><p> If you want to retain assets over the long-term, then your relationship must extend to present and future stakeholders.</p><h3> 2. Serve Your Client <br/>  </h3><p> Check your behaviors. Whom do they suggest your client is? With whom do you speak the most? Whom do you contact with questions or recommendations? Saying the couple or the family is your client is not enough. Your actions must reflect the same.</p><p> If your attention is skewed, you are missing the opportunity to develop a relationship with the other member(s) of the couple or family, and they will likely move the assets when the person they view as your client dies.</p><h3> 3. Know Your Client <br/>  </h3><p> If you are working with a couple or a family, you must get to know each person individually. Know their priorities, preferences, dreams, and fears. Your job is not to reconcile differences. Your job is to know them and develop a plan comprehensive enough to honor them.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Understand Your Client <br/>  </h3><p> Hearing is not enough. You must understand. To understand, you must listen  actively. Active listening means listening to understand, not to respond. Park your thoughts. You can come back to them. Listening in order to understand is one of the greatest services you can your clients.</p><h3> 5. Put Purpose First <br/>  </h3><p> Your technical expertise makes you shine at offering solutions. This expertise can also create blinders. You may be too quick to hear objectives and match them with methods. This challenge is exacerbated by:</p><li> Clients expectations that you want to hear their goals and</li><li> Their lack of understanding of what their true goals are.</li><p> The purpose is the meaning, significance, or why behind the goal. Once purpose is known, the true goals may be determined. What to do and how to do it will then follow.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> 6. Embrace Resistance <br/>  </h3><p> Do you have clients who have yet to implement their plan in some way? Indeed, weve all been there. Investigate the disconnect behind the procrastination. It could be a warning sign that an important part of their purpose has not been met, or that they have lost sight of how the action steps promote their purpose.</p><h3> 7. Go Wide <br/>  </h3><p> Your client is more than his or her financial assets. Each has social, intellectual, and spiritual capital, as well. Capture and utilize those resources. Most baby boomers and their parents are more concerned with leaving an emotional inheritance than they are a financial one. Help them plan for these priceless assets, too.</p><h3> 8. Address the Elephants <br/>  </h3><p> Addiction. Entitlement issues. Resentments. Unprepared heirs. As their trusted advisor, you know the issues that linger and drain life from your clients. Money wont solve these. Indeed, it often makes them worse. Listen as clients speak about the issues. Engage them in exploring options. Do not ignore the elephants merely because they are outside your expertise.</p><h3> 9. Do No Harm <br/>  </h3><p> Know the limits of your expertise. Know when to refer or bring in an expert. Connect them with resources and encourage them to press on to address known challenges.</p><h3> 10. Collaborate <br/>  </h3><p> Embrace the wisdom and expertise of others. Communicate openly with your clients other advisors. Exchange ideas and seek to reach consensus before sharing recommendations with your client. Meet jointly with your client and their advisors. The return on this investment will be increased clarity of communication, greater efficiency, and client appreciation for a streamlined process.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 14:54:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 14:54:05.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_8l23Z9G.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/embrace-resistance-how-to-retain-a-widow-or-heir-after-your-client-dies/\", \"post_id\": \"12879\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 14:54:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 14:54:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"embrace-resistance-how-to-retain-a-widow-or-heir-after-your-client-dies\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12878\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6248\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/embrace-resistance-how-retain-widow-or-heir-after-your-client-dies.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"845\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470139200,"author_id":334,"chart_url":""}

The rigor mortis stuff is for later&hellip;.it is the stuff that we have to do when we are doing the job.</p><p> But it is not the stuff to showcase when trying to get the job.</p><p> So a simple diagram such as Carl&rsquo;s is perfect for explaining what the objective is.  The next thing we need to do though is show them how the whole planning thing works for them in their world.  This is how I like to do it, and my preference is overwhelmingly to actually physically draw it in front of prospects while talking about it.  But if you don&rsquo;t like drawing diagrams in front of clients then the pretty version is this:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"767\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/life-planning.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/></p><p> &ldquo;The entire process is about how we improve your financial position over time.  The end game, regardless of when that point in time is, is firmly focussed on how you get what you need to live the life you want to live.  The whole point of financial planning is to have enough money to use in living how you want to isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> So how we go about it is by figuring out where you are now, and identifying the stuff that can totally de-rail things.

{"original_id":6008,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Travel Tips for Your Next Flight","link":"5-travel-tips-for-your-next-flight","source_link":null,"content":"<p> l&rsquo;ll admit I don&rsquo;t fly much. However, I just returned from a trip to Northwest Arkansas, where my nephew got married. Because of this excursion, I picked up a few travel tips that I thought I would pass along.</p><h3> 1. Download the app of the airline you&rsquo;re flying on <br/>  </h3><p> Because US Airways and American Airlines are going through a merger, I wound up downloading both of their apps. The US Airways app has a Boarding Pass Wallet that, after I entered my contact information, I was able to load my coordinates into.</p><p> Fortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t checking luggage, so I didn&rsquo;t need to use it to track our bags. But a bag-tracking feature is available and I understand it comes in handy. For instance, since airlines scan your bag a) when you check it, b) when it goes onto the plane, and c) when it comes, off, you should know with the app whether your bag made the connection or not.</p><p> Another benefit is you can actually use the app for free while flying. This is very helpful to see if your next flight is on time or not as well as to see what gate to make it over to.</p><h3> 2. Use mobile boarding passes, if possible <br/>  </h3><p> I may be one of the last holdouts to do away with paper, but I thought I would take the plunge and go paperless this time. It all worked out fine.</p><p> When I checked in the night before our flight, I found out that I had a new frequent flyer number and that I didn&rsquo;t have a mobile boarding pass. I chalked this up to the merger. Interestingly enough, I did have mobile boarding passes on the return flights and they worked pretty well.</p><p> The only scare came when the app wouldn&rsquo;t open. I had to reboot my phone and it opened just in time. Fortunately I wasn&rsquo;t standing in line to board at that time. I&rsquo;m not sure how the airline would have handled it if all I had was a mobile boarding pass that didn&rsquo;t open or if the phone was completely out of juice.</p><h3> 3. Don&rsquo;t just jump at the first opportunity to go a different route <br/>  </h3><p> When we found out that we were waiting for a flight attendant to arrive at the airport and that our boarding time and flight would be delayed, they called me up to the counter. They offered to reroute us through another city (Charlotte, instead of Dallas), I was tempted to leap at the opportunity. The proposed flight was already boarding and, I was told, we could get on it. But we had to hurry because it was leaving from a different gate. Well, I stayed and asked a few questions and, sure enough, a few minutes later, they had released the seats to other passengers, so they were no longer available. Had I leapt at the offer, we probably would have had to run to catch it &ndash; and it got in an hour after we eventually arrived. So my takeaway was &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic, ask questions.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Put your luggage in the overhead bin across the aisle and in front of you <br/> <br/>  </h3><p> As long as I&rsquo;ve been flying, I&rsquo;ve subscribed to this method. Most people put their bags directly above their seat and sometimes behind it. If you do that, you don&rsquo;t know who is rummaging around in your suitcase right over top of you. And if you put it behind your seat, you have to &ldquo;fight oncoming traffic&rdquo; after the flight, which isn&rsquo;t fun. If you wind up putting the suitcase behind you and insist on getting it while people are filing out, I guarantee you won&rsquo;t make many friends. I retrieved a bag for someone a few rows in front of me who had moved closer to the cockpit after she had stored her luggage in the overhead bin. While I was happy to pass it up to her, don&rsquo;t expect others to be so willing to pass your bag over the heads of others.</p><h3> 5. Consider using Uber <br/>  </h3><p> The hotel where we were staying did not have an airport shuttle. I was told that a taxi to the airport would cost between $30 and $40. I&rsquo;d never tried Uber before and thought I&rsquo;d check it out. The Uber fare turned out to be $7.03 (that low apparently because it was the first time I used it). The driver was on time. And he even spoke English and shared with us a lot of local knowledge.</p><p> Seasoned travelers may scoff at these tips as being rudimentary. Nevertheless, I thought to myself that &ldquo;If I help one person, then it&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 14:58:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 14:58:37.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_m0tuooR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-travel-tips-for-your-next-flight/\", \"post_id\": \"12885\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 14:58:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 14:58:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-travel-tips-for-your-next-flight\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12884\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6250\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/5-travel-tips-your-next-flight.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"397\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470164400,"author_id":178,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6009,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Win the Argument and Lose the Customer! Create a Win/Win for Everyone","link":"dont-win-the-argument-and-lose-the-customer-create-a-win-win-for-everyone","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There is an old customer service saying that has to do with whenever someone disagrees with a customer. <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;re not trying to win an argument. You&rsquo;re trying to win a customer.</p><p> You really can&rsquo;t win an argument with a customer. It&rsquo;s not that the customer is always right. They aren&rsquo;t.  If you&rsquo;ve followed my work, you know that I believe the customer is not always right. So, how can you let them always win an argument?</p><p> First, don&rsquo;t get in the argument to begin with. Sure, you can win the argument, but you lose the customer. But, what you can always do is be respectful. You can let the customer keep their dignity. You can agree to disagree. You can work toward a mutually agreed upon solution. In short, you win the customer, not the argument.</p><p> This concept became even more evident to me as I sat in on a meeting with one of the top automotive manufacturers in the world, Lexus. They are known for great cars and incredible service.</p><p> At one of their corporate meetings they had a roleplay exercise where some of their employees pretended to be unhappy customers and others pretended to be employees at a dealership. It was fascinating to watch great training come to life, as the employees representing the dealership managed the customer&rsquo;s complaints with skill and tact.</p><p> One very clear message came out of the exercise. They were not just trying to just fix the car. They also wanted to fix the customer. They wanted to move the customer from unhappy to happy. From angry or disappointed to pleased. From frustrated to fulfilled.</p><p> At Lexus, they recognized that a broken car can also mean a broken customer. The challenge is to fix both.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Sometimes a customer is legitimately upset. For example, they may have brought their car in more than once to have the car serviced for the same problem. So, what will make them happy? Maybe the customer wants a refund for the repairs or a credit for a future repair. Or, maybe the customer doesn&rsquo;t want any financial compensation. They just want their car fixed and taken care of by a service rep who truly cares, shows empathy (that one&rsquo;s important) and apologizes for the inconvenience.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to be in the car business to take advantage and learn from Lexus. Learn what will make the customer happy. It may be as simple as just asking. (You don&rsquo;t know if you don&rsquo;t ask.) It&rsquo;s definitely not arguing with the customer. Find out what&rsquo;s behind any frustration, disappointment, and even anger. Talking it through with the customer, rather than pointing blame or making excuses may be the simple solution.</p><p> Yes, you may be in a situation that is more complicated than a car repair. Yet, however simple or difficult the situation is, don&rsquo;t argue. You might win the argument, but you may lose the customer in the process. Look for the solution that is reasonable and is a win/win for both you and your customer.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 14:59:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 14:59:44.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_TmNqVOg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-win-the-argument-and-lose-the-customer-create-a-win-win-for-everyone/\", \"post_id\": \"12887\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 14:59:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 14:59:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-win-the-argument-and-lose-the-customer-create-a-win-win-for-everyone\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12886\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6251\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dont-win-argument-and-lose-customer-create-winwin-everyone.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1406\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470153600,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}

As of June 2015, $4.7 trillion were invested in 401(k) accounts, plus another $2.1 trillion in non-401(k) defined-contribution plans. As John Oliver recently detailed, these conflicts of interest can cost millions over the course of a single retirement plan&rsquo;s life. </p><h3> Why the Conflicts Exist <br/>  </h3><p> The reason for the existence of these conflicts of interest is simple. Managers are prioritizing the profits of their institution over the success of the retirement plans they oversee. And there is no question that it is a raw deal for the investor. We&rsquo;ve previously covered how many actively managed funds don&rsquo;t even beat the market in the first place, and this study confirms that failing funds aren&rsquo;t even taken off the menu of options.</p><p> Imagine if your local restaurant kept undercooking their chicken and everyone was getting sick, but they refused to change the recipe.</p><p> Many employees at big asset management firms are now suing their own companies to liberate their own retirement plans from management. These people know it&rsquo;s a scam, and God forbid that their own money gets caught up in it, but by and large they are OK with selling you inefficient funds.</p><p> These current events&mdash;and the study&mdash;indicate that conflicts of interest are pervasive in all aspects of the retirement planning industry, whether it&rsquo;s a 401(k) through your employer or via traditional financial advisors. Dealing with this reality requires vigilance on your part.</p><p> To return to the analogy of the undercooked chicken, it would be an easy case to deal with since everyone could tell that the chicken was making them sick. But what allows traditional asset companies to get away with conflicts of interest is that many people are simply too busy to monitor their accounts&mdash;that is, to find out if they are sick or not. If the undercooked chicken gave you an illness that was hard to detect, it would be much easier for the restaurant to get away with it.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Luckily, the tide is beginning to turn, and you can impact change, even with your 401(k). You should become an advocate for your own money. Contact your HR department and ask to see the performance of the menu of funds. See who&rsquo;s managing it, how the menu has changed and evaluate the extent of conflicts of interest.</p><p> Ultimately, independent, conflict-free advice and management is the best cure for the industry&rsquo;s problem.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 15:06:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 15:06:30.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_fnDGhY4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-conflicts-of-interest-around-401k-plans/\", \"post_id\": \"12892\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 15:06:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 15:06:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-conflicts-of-interest-around-401k-plans\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12891\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6253\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/conflicts-interest-around-401k-plans.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"692\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470132000,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6012,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Understanding the Trickiness of Dividing Annuities in Divorce","link":"understanding-the-trickiness-of-dividing-annuities-in-divorce","source_link":null,"content":"<h3>When it comes to dividing marital property in divorce, it is important for you and your spouse to understand the nature of any asset you may have to divide.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It would not be unusual if you or your spouse owned an annuity outright or owned an annuity as part of your retirement account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annuities play a key role in portfolio diversification and can anchor fixed income allocation for those nearing retirement. However, in divorce, annuities can also be the black sheep of the marital pie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let us define what is an annuity. Annuities were designed to be a reliable means of securing a steady cash flow for an individual during retirement years and to reduce fears of outliving one&rsquo;s assets. An annuity is a legal contract that binds an insurance company to provide guaranteed periodic payments to the annuitant for a specific time period or for lifetime. In retirement, an annuity guarantees risk-free retirement income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annuities come in all shapes and sizes. Each annuity contract varies among provider companies and each has its own set of rules. Each annuity contract specifies the structure (variable or fixed rate), any penalties for early withdrawal, surrender period, spousal provisions such as a survivor clause, death benefit, etc. Some are in retirement plans and some are not; some have living and death benefits, others do not. Some are deferred or immediate; some are non-qualified or qualified.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Non-Divisible</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The complexity of the nature of annuities makes this asset very difficult to divide or value for purposes of equitable distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, annuities are not like other marital assets which can be divided readily between both spouses. Divorce attorneys may not understand the impact of dividing annuities. There can be significant risks with changing an original annuity contract and there can be disastrous tax consequences if the annuity is not divided properly pursuant to divorce. You absolutely need to know all about the annuity, and along with the help of a financial expert, to determine if, and how, the annuity can be split. Otherwise, you could suffer lasting damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A non-qualified annuity is funded with after tax dollars which means there is no tax deduction for deposits into the contract. You have already paid taxes on the money you put in. When you take money out, each withdrawal will have two parts &ndash; some will be part of your original deposit (the principal) and the balance will be earnings (appreciation). Only the earnings will be taxed on withdrawal. Splitting a nonqualified annuity does not require a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A qualified annuity is like an IRA. You deposit money into the contract and it is tax deductible; withdrawals are 100% taxable. Qualified annuities are used in connection with tax-advantaged retirement plans, such as defined benefit pension plans and 403b plans (eg. tax sheltered annuities for teachers).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of annuity requires a QDRO if it is to be divided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you split an annuity, then any share of the annuity you receive will not be taxable at time of transfer in the context of divorce. However, if divided, you can receive at most the benefits of the existing contract, nothing more. You need to read the annuity contract to know if you are able to receive via QDRO a lump sum, cash-out, or rollover to an IRA. If the answer is no, you may not want this annuity as part of your share of the marital assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, annuities are not like other marital assets which can be divided readily between both spouses. Divorce attorneys may not understand this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Four options in dividing annuities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four options for dividing an annuity. The first option is a withdrawal of all or part of the annuity with a direct distribution to you. The second choice is to transfer the amount awarded to you, whether a specific dollar amount or percentage of total contract value, via a direct transfer to your IRA. The third method, preferred by the vast majority of insurance companies, is to take a &ldquo;withdrawal&rdquo; from original contract and then issue two new contracts to you and your ex-spouse, that set forth pro rata benefits and new account values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Processing new contracts is much easier and less of an administrative burden for the insurance companies. The last choice, that does not split the annuity but may be necessary in some divorce agreements, is to transfer ownership of the contract in whole to you, in which case, a new contract goes into effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With any of these options, the annuitant must authorize the insurance company to split or transfer the annuity and a QDRO may be required. You should always confirm with the annuity provider if they will allow an annuity to be split, transferred to a new owner, or allow for lump sum cash-outs. The insurance company should be contacted early in the divorce process to determine the options and what penalties; expenses or taxes will be incurred. Make sure you get everything in writing from the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Are you getting what you think you&rsquo;re getting?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens in the process of issuing new contracts? You have risk &ndash; and, you may not be getting what you think you are as a new annuitant. Why? New contracts may not provide the same benefits as the original. Here are some of the adjustments that can be made by insurance companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest rate guarantees may be less than the original (in favor of the insurance companies).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some companies may treat a withdrawal as a taxable event in the absence of proper and clear instructions in the divorce decree</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a living benefit is attached to the policy, a withdrawal will probably reduce both ex-spouses&rsquo; future guaranteed income. Living benefits generally guarantee some sort of defined payout while the annuitant is still alive; i.e., the guarantee of the annuitant&rsquo;s principal, or, a specific amount of income per year, usually 4-6% of the income base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A withdrawal exceeding that amount is called an excess withdrawal. A withdrawal of half of the annuity value will be considered an excess withdrawal and result in a reduction of future guaranteed income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some contracts also call for an excess withdrawal to reset the living benefit base to the new account value, thereby wiping out any additional benefits earned on the contract to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many living benefit designs stop growing the income base at the guaranteed growth rate upon the first withdrawal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The death benefit will likely be reduced pro rata by the amount of the &ldquo;withdrawal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surrender charges may apply to the withdrawal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new surrender period can be triggered with a new contract (you may have to wait up to 10 years before withdrawing).<br />\r\nSeparate riders may not be renewed or available in new contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Concepts to Consider</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do your homework and understand the nature of your annuity (call the company and get detailed policy information in writing)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to offset the annuity with other assets of equivalent value in the property division (you will need proper actuarial valuation)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try not to split the annuity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore sharing the income stream from the annuity in the future (if used for income).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Know when a QDRO is required to avoid tax disasters upon distribution</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, an annuity is a complex financial asset and one that can be irreparably harmed by uninformed parties seeking to divide, transfer or cash out in divorce. Insurance and investment companies do not make it easy for you to execute terms of your divorce agreement if instructions are unspecific or unclear and contrary to their own policies. Act early and do your homework to better understand your annuity.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 15:08:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 15:08:38.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_ESmk5w6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/understanding-the-trickiness-of-dividing-annuities-in-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"12894\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 15:08:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 15:08:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"understanding-the-trickiness-of-dividing-annuities-in-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12893\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6254\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/understanding-trickiness-dividing-annuities-divorce.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"3528\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":29318,"author_id":307,"chart_url":""}

You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to wait until you have passed to share some of your estate with your loved ones, however. Even if you ultimately decide not to give your kids their inheritance while you are still alive, it&rsquo;s a good idea to discuss the contents of your will before you pass on.</p><h3> Discuss your Plans for your Estate in Advance</h3><p> Being open about how your estate will be divided in advance will avoid fighting among your survivors and hurt feelings after you have passed. The final decisions about how your money and property are to be divided on your death is yours, but you can still ask your children about any preferences they may have about certain items that you own, such as a cottage, jewelry, or even small personal items.</p><p> Some family members may have strong feelings about wanting a particular item, while others may not be interested in that piece at all. You won&rsquo;t know how someone feels about family property unless you ask, and the answers you get may end up surprising you.</p><h3> If you Decide to Give your Kids Their Inheritance While you are Still Alive</h3><p> Once you have decided to give a gift, the next question to consider is when to give the money. By the time your child is in his or her mid-40s, he or she is probably mature enough to handle receiving a partial inheritance.</p><p> Keep in mind that if you choose to hand over a gift, your child can choose to do what he or she wishes with the money. The choices your child makes about what to do with the money may not be the same what you would do with the same kind of gift, and you need to be prepared to step back and let them do what they want with it.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> How Much Should you Give a Child or Grandchild</h3><p> The amount you choose to give a child or a grandchild is entirely up to you. Some people like to contribute to a grandchild&rsquo;s education by making contributions to a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) so that the grandchild can benefit while they are still alive.</p><p> You could also choose to give your child or grandchild a lump sum as a gift while you are alive. You will want to make sure you don&rsquo;t jeopardize your retirement savings as a result; make sure whatever you give doesn&rsquo;t interfere with your cash flow.</p><h3> Child or Grandchild&rsquo;s Expectation of More</h3><p> Another issue you may run into with giving an inheritance early is the expectation that there will be more money coming in the future. If your decision is that you will be making only one gift during your lifetime, make your wishes clear to your family and stick to it. You may have to get used to listening to your children telling you about difficult times they are going through without jumping in to take action to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the problem, even though it&rsquo;s hard not to try to fix the situation. .</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 15:10:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 15:10:46.000000","image_url":"uploads/2016/08/should-you-give-your-kids-their-inheritance-while-you-are-still-alive.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/should-you-give-your-kids-their-inheritance-while-you-are-still-alive/\", \"post_id\": \"12896\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 15:10:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 15:10:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"should-you-give-your-kids-their-inheritance-while-you-are-still-alive\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12895\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6255\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/should-you-give-your-kids-their-inheritance-while-you-are-still-alive.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"929\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470128400,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6014,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Ways Managers Can Build Employee Trust in the Workplace","link":"7-ways-managers-can-build-employee-trust-in-the-workplace","source_link":null,"content":"<p> How many people trust their managers? A recent study by Edelman found that one in three employees don&rsquo;t trust their employer. Another study by EY found that number to be even lower, with only 46% having trust in their organization, and 49% in their boss/team.</p><p> Trust is one of the most important things you need in the workplace. Without it you won&rsquo;t have the environment you need for an effective feedback culture to grow.</p><h3> So how can you help close the trust gap between employees and managers? <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Honesty is the best policy <br/>  </h3><p> It may be hard to share difficult news sometimes. We naturally have a tendency to believe that delivering bad news will impact other people&rsquo;s opinion of ourselves. In fact, a recent article by Forbes addressed a reader&rsquo;s question about how to deal with a boss who lies to avoid answering difficult questions from employees.</p><p> Being honest, even during tough times, is something the most trustworthy leaders learn how to do. Whether your company hasn&rsquo;t met its goals and is unable to award bonuses this year, or you&rsquo;ve decided to let go of a member of your team. Rather than putting off the difficult talk, employees will respect a manager who is able to openly explain the situation, take questions and give them the facts.</p><h3> 2. Admit mistakes <br/>  </h3><p> While being transparent about bad news is difficult, admitting when it&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;s made a mistake can be even more difficult. You may be surprised to find that employees will like you more for it.</p><p> Admitting mistakes actually makes you more human and thereby more likeable to others. Psychologists call this the Pratfall effect. Being able to admit to and take responsibility for your mistakes is a major part of being a great leader.</p><h3> 3. Treat employees like people, not numbers <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the numbers. If your job is based on meeting certain performance metrics, managers can often get in the habit of seeing their employees in terms of output achieved.</p><p> Managers don&rsquo;t have to be their employee&rsquo;s best friend, but they should be conscious of maintaining a healthy work environment. Managers who encourage extreme competition between peers and late hours are going to end up creating a toxic work culture in which employees don&rsquo;t trust their manager or each other.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to know all the details of your employees&rsquo; personal lives, but managers should have a good understanding of what their employees enjoy about their job most. If you&rsquo;re able to pick up on what your employee&rsquo;s need to do their best, they&rsquo;ll go the extra mile for you.</p><h3> 4. Give credit to your employees <br/>  </h3><p> As the team leader, you will often receive recognition from your peers and upper management for your team&rsquo;s efforts. Make sure you share appreciation and acknowledge your team members for their hard work. A recent study by Globoforce showed that employees who received recognition from their leaders recently were significantly more likely to trust them (82% vs 48%).</p><h3> 5. Put yourself on the line for your team <br/>  </h3><p> To gain trust, managers must be their team&rsquo;s best advocate. While inwardly you may have constructive feedback for your team about the way they approached an assignment, outwardly you must be willing to praise, advocate and take responsibility for your team&rsquo;s actions. When team members make a mistake it may seem common sense to distance one&rsquo;s self. This may maintain your reputation, but it won&rsquo;t win you your team&rsquo;s trust. This is a difficult balance that each manager will have to maintain on their own, but having a team that is highly committed to you will help you achieve the results you want in the long run.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 6. Teach your managers how to overcome bias <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s not that managers are inherently biased, as people we have a natural tendency to make assumptions about others. This can result in managers unintentionally favoring some employees over others, known by psychologists as the &lsquo;rater bias&rsquo;. Unconscious bias contributes to a major loss in trust between managers and employees, especially when it affects performance reviews. Help managers learn how to identify and avoid bias in the workplace.</p><h3> 7. Make yourself vulnerable. Ask for feedback. <br/>  </h3><p> Trust isn&rsquo;t the magic key to workplace bliss. Issues will always arise at work, but closing the trust gap means employees will be more likely to really take on and reflect on feedback from their managers and be more honest when they give upward feedback. As more and more employees are publicizing their complaints about their employer on Glassdoor, you want a workforce that feels free and comfortable to express concerns before they boil over onto the internet.</p><p> But to gain this type of trust, managers must first demonstrate they&rsquo;re willing to open themselves up to criticism. If they truly start to put themselves out there and ask for employee feedback, their reports will recognize this and start to follow their example.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 15:12:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 15:12:21.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_j8GWy0O.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-ways-managers-can-build-employee-trust-in-the-workplace/\", \"post_id\": \"12898\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 15:12:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 15:12:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-ways-managers-can-build-employee-trust-in-the-workplace\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12897\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6256\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/7-ways-managers-can-build-employee-trust-workplace.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"790\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470146400,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6015,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Avoid Awkward Conversations When Meeting Someone New","link":"how-to-avoid-awkward-conversations-when-meeting-someone-new","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> How many times have you met someone, spoke for two awkward minutes and moved on never to speak with that person again?  <br/>  </h3><p> Every person you ever meet isn&rsquo;t going to be your friend but we do need actively build new friendships. We&rsquo;re social animals and need to have relationships with people. We need to start conversations with people for professional reasons as well.</p><p> Friends drop off. They get married, have kids. People move. We have to work to get new friends and maintain those relationships throughout our lives. But it&rsquo;s not easy. We get new jobs where we have to meet &amp; have good relationships with our new colleagues.</p><p> Awkward.</p><p> Starting conversations happens when you&rsquo;re meeting new people but also when you&rsquo;re in the conference room &amp; the meeting hasn&rsquo;t started yet. Transition times I call them. Just before the job interview starts. (Crickets)</p><p> Before I started this piece I read every article I could find on the interweb about starting conversations.  People are still recommending that you ask questions (NO! Don&rsquo;t do it!) and talk about the weather (Not. joking.)</p><p> So why the awkward conversations? What is it that you&rsquo;re doing wrong that&rsquo;s making your introductory conversations awkward? I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Ask Questions <br/>  </h3><p> Nobody wants to answer the questions &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; Nobody does. So why do we keep asking? People have been asked that question countless times; they have routine answers that bore even them when they tell the stories.</p><p> Where people are from and what they do are details that are best left for after you get to know someone a bit. Unless you make your decisions about people based on that information. &ldquo;Oh. You&rsquo;re a plumber? Ba-bye!&rdquo; Making conversation isn&rsquo;t Tinder, folks. We don&rsquo;t need the specs before we start to chat.</p><p> Very often after these questions are answered you&rsquo;ve reached an awkward brick wall. The conversation goes nowhere and there&rsquo;s an awkward silence.</p><p> Q. Whadja do this weekend?</p><p> A.  (Mind draws a blank) Uuuuuuhh. I did my laundry&hellip; nothin&rsquo; much</p><p> Q. Hey! What&rsquo;s going on?</p><p> A.  Uuuuuhhh&hellip;nothing&hellip;things are good&hellip;how about you?</p><p> Do you ever get into the How Are You Loop?</p><p> Hi! Nice to see you! How are you?</p><p> Great! Great! How are you?</p><p> Good &amp; you? ad infinitum.</p><p> That&rsquo;s awkward.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the deal. I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t be interested in what others have to say. Our goal is to get people to talk. Counterintuitively, asking questions doesn&rsquo;t help us achieve that goal when we don&rsquo;t know someone well.  When you&rsquo;ve asked some boring questions people begin to get nervous &amp; they start thinking, &ldquo;Oh Jeez! What am I going to say next!&rdquo; Many people think their stories of where they&rsquo;re from &amp; what they do are boring to others.</p><p> I would be so annoyed if someone came up to me and asked me questions about time, date, the season or even the location you are at.</p><p> Solution 1. Have an arsenal of anecdotes until you learn to create them on the spot.</p><p> Solution 2. This sounds scary but it&rsquo;s magic: Talk about your emotions. The emoji of conversations.</p><p> I was supposed to meet some friends at a restaurant on Little West 12th Street. I had never heard of Little W12! This was before the days of GPS on your phone. I was actually afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t find it! Isn&rsquo;t that silly?! What a crazy fear. I got there early, so I sat at the bar next to some guy &amp; I told him that I&rsquo;d never heard of this part of town &amp; that I was actually afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t find it. He was able to relate &amp; told me his tales on the topics. By the time my friends got there he &amp; I were having a hoot &amp; a holler.</p><p> Talking about how you feel about something makes people relate to you. It disarms them. Sharing emotions like fear and embarrassment warm people up and establish strong ties at the onset eliminating the need for boring Q&amp;As.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> It&rsquo;s not about you <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t reply to everything someone says with a story about you. We call those people 1-uppers &amp; they get tiresome really quick.</p><p> You:  Hi where are you from?</p><p> Other person:  I&rsquo;m from London.</p><p> You: Oh. I&rsquo;ve been to London. Do you know John Smith?</p><p> Quick story: I travel down to Austin a few times a year to help a corporate client. It&rsquo;s awesome. (Or as my 7 year old says, &ldquo;Saucesome.&rdquo;) Very hospitable folk. Always take me out after work to check out the amazing food &amp; beverages. Margaritas! But I digress. I often stayed at the same hotel and a girl that worked there asked me every single time where I was from. Every time I check-in, she goes, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d tell her, &ldquo;I live in Manhattan.&rdquo; she&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;I hate New York. I went there once and there was steam coming out of the ground, it was so dirty.&rdquo;</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure she wasn&rsquo;t trying to be my friend, mind you, but insulting where I&rsquo;m from is not going to make me like you. This story contains both errors I&rsquo;ve mentioned thus far. Asking, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; Then making where I&rsquo;m from be about her.</p><p> Side-note: &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; is a difficult question for most people to answer these days. Where am I from? I&rsquo;m from a small town on the north shore of Long Island. I&rsquo;ve lived in quite a few places since then. Most people ask these questions just because they&rsquo;re making conversation. I think we need to work a little harder than that.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Compliment, don&rsquo;t comment <br/>  </h3><p> If someone changes their hair color they&rsquo;re usually cognizant of it. You don&rsquo;t have to tell them. &ldquo;You colored your hair.&rdquo; Those are some shark senses right there. Just say, &ldquo;Wow! Your hair looks great!&rdquo; Or if you can&rsquo;t bring yourself to lie, talk about something else. People know when your compliment is  not genuine.</p><p> I just get off the plane in Honolulu, go straight to Duke&rsquo;s in Waikiki for the first night of the family reunion &amp; my cousin gives me a hug &amp; says, &ldquo;You smell like you just got out of a tanning salon.&rdquo; That is a comment. I have no idea what it means, I&rsquo;d like to think I smelled ok. Maybe he thinks the tanning salon smell is a good one, I don&rsquo;t know. One things for sure, not a great conversation starter.</p><p> One of my clients would go to work every day &amp; the guy she sat next to would comment daily on what she was wearing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wearing a blazer, aren&rsquo;t you hot?&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a skirt on&ndash;got a date tonight?&rdquo; Needless to say, he was never invited out for happy hour after work.</p><p> Compliment within the boundaries of appropriateness, of course. I personally don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s appropriate for a colleague to comment or compliment a woman&rsquo;s skirt. To keep the convo going after a compliment, you can ask a question. I know I know no questions, but make sure it&rsquo;s a unique question, and as long as you have a cool reply to the answer it&rsquo;s ok!</p><p> For example, I was at a bar &amp; my bag was on the counter. A guy comes up to me, says &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great bag! Where did you get it?&rdquo; A great opening question that is alsoa compliment. After I told him, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my sister&rsquo;s birthday I&rsquo;m going to get it for her.&rdquo; We chatted for a bit after that. After he got my digits he confessed it was a lie. His sister wasn&rsquo;t having a birthday. Kudos to him! It takes courage to start a conversation with a total stranger, and his little white lie didn&rsquo;t do any harm.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t let the truth get in the way of a good story&ndash;or conversation starter!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 15:20:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 15:20:00.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_6fVvv79.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-avoid-awkward-conversations-when-meeting-someone-new/\", \"post_id\": \"12900\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 15:20:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 15:20:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-avoid-awkward-conversations-when-meeting-someone-new\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12899\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6257\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/how-avoid-awkward-conversations-when-meeting-someone-new.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1217\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470157200,"author_id":202,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6016,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why You Should Disrupt Your Own Business Before a Competitor or New Start-Up Does","link":"why-you-should-disrupt-your-own-business-before-a-competitor-or-new-start-up-does","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Many companies accept the status quo when it comes to operating models. They have done stuff in a certain way for a long time. It works, so why change? Because you want a flourishing future, I guess?</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t disrupt yourself, a competitor or new start-up will. The impact of both options is the difference between a chameleon or a dinosaur. Therefore always challenge your status quo. Don&rsquo;t be caught by surprise, surprise yourself. How? Start by improving the usage of business intelligence. Create competitive advantage and start to operate smarter.</p><p> These days reporting is really sophisticated. Collecting data and convert it into visual analytics is no rocket science anymore. The tools are widely available and are a huge leap forward for decision making. Information provides people with knowledge, enabling them to anticipate on identified possibilities and to take action. The digital economy requires you to look at ways to disrupt (yourself). Take for instance the effect of robotics and augmented reality on roles and processes. How is your organisation going to deal with that? These are inevitable developments due to the course technology is sailing.</p><h3> Disruption by breaking down silos <br/>  </h3><p> Why shouldn&rsquo;t you attack your HR function with business intelligence? Why not analyse your marketing strategy with new tools? Not because you were asked to, but because you are eager to explore new possibilities. Why don&rsquo;t you dare your IT department to do things differently. Valid questions in this era of digital transformation, I think.</p><p> Organisations must overcome the silo mentality. Thinking in silos will prevent them from becoming more agile. Ignoring the added value of  connecting departmental data is a missed opportunity. By connecting fields and innovative ideas you might just have the handle that enables you to beat competition, surprise your customer or improve your service.</p><h3> Examples of disruptive companies <br/>  </h3><p> Take for instance Amazon. They steered their course from books, to the retail landscape to their latest launch:  <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/22/amazonfresh-amazons-grocery-delivery-service-wakes-back-up-with-a-launch-in-boston/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AmazonFresh </a> , a grocery delivery service. Or our Dutch example  <a href=\"http://www.bol.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Bol.com </a>  with their similar strategy. They also started with books, followed up with cd&rsquo;s and eventually expanded to a wide variety of retail businesses of which products are partly distributed by themselves, partly by a network of suppliers. Did they feel threatened by the circular economy? On the contrary, they embraced it by incorporating second-hand sales in their platform.</p><p> Another example is the  <a href=\"http://www.plannerstack.org/#about-us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Plannerstack Foundation </a> , a non-profit organisation that rethinks the travel information business and unlocks possibilities in mobility topics. Plannerstack brings the future of mobility solutions and travel information technology today. The members were forerunners in propagating open data in this industry. They reorganised open data into a scalable stack that enables companies to develop smart applications.</p><p> Need more examples? Nintendo&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/28/nintendo-news-experts-say-pokemon-go-stakeholders-future-is-bright-in-mobile-gaming-and-intellectual-property.html\" target=\"_blank\">  Pok&eacute;mon Go </a>  brought with one pivot augmented reality to a mass audience and repositioned the company in the gaming sector. Other much-discussed companies are  <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Uber </a>  (taxi),  <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Airbnb </a>  (bed &amp; breakfast) and  <a href=\"http://www.toogethr.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Toogethr </a>  (ridesharing). Check them out and learn what they did differently.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Distinguishing strategy <br/>  </h3><p> Is everything these companies do a success? No. They also had to decommission products, functionalities and services along the way. But by trying and failing they learned, got smarter and succeeded in creating powerful innovations and vital businesses.</p><p> Release your organisation from its cumbersome character and make it agile and future-proof. Think like start-ups. It might look like their culture of perks is driving innovation. It&rsquo;s not. It is the way they attack problems and mobilise talent that makes them unique and agile. Think big, start small and act fast. Create space to incubate new ideas. Execute a great idea with high-speed acceleration and break off quickly when the idea is not commercially viable.</p><p> Disruption is a mindset. It&rsquo;s better to disrupt yourself than to be destroyed by a competitor or a newcomer. Especially large companies have their own, sometimes age-old, DNA. Good news for these organisations: DNA can mutate. It takes smart modifications in the operating model to become or stay a significant player in the market. How your company approaches business intelligence in the boardroom is key in this process. Expand your horizon. Revealing opportunities in the digital economy is a different kind of art. Become a Picasso!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 15:22:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 15:22:11.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_0GTr1tu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-should-disrupt-your-own-business-before-a-competitor-or-new-start-up-does/\", \"post_id\": \"12901\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 15:22:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 15:22:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-should-disrupt-your-own-business-before-a-competitor-or-new-start-up-does\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12902\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6258\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/why-you-should-disrupt-your-own-business-competitor-or-new-start-does.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1142\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470150000,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;m a ritual junkie.  <br/>  </h3><p> When I do my daily walk I take the same route, at the same time, on the same side of the street every day. It helps me think. It soothes me, like a salve; makes me a much nicer person. My husband finds this boring, he likes to mix things up, which is why he rarely joins me.</p><p> When Jonathan Fields put out his wonderful book Uncertainty: Turning Fear and Doubt into Fuel for Brilliance, lauding the value of ritual, I was thrilled, as it justified my boring ways.</p><p> But I now realize, maybe once in awhile I need to mix things up a bit.</p><p> It&rsquo;s hot here in NY. It feels hotter than Dallas-hot. Yesterday it was too hot to walk on my normal side so I had to switch to the other side of the street to find respite in the shade. It blew my mind! It was if I were in foreign territory!</p><p> Everything looked different. I saw houses I had never seen before! Had I not walked this exact same route hundreds of times I would have been worried I was lost.  Isn&rsquo;t it amazing that something so simple as switching street sides could alter my whole perception?</p><p> But we don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a whole other way of looking at things when we&rsquo;re on our normal path.

Blinders work, because the horses can&rsquo;t see the full picture.  It keeps them focused and safe.

Many sought to highlight their innate &ldquo;Googleyness&rdquo; or attributes that the perfect applicant should supposedly possess.</p><p> Almost everyone wanted to be part of one of the most sought-after companies in the world, which is known for its enviable office perks and fun office atmosphere, but, getting in is no walk in the park. Laszlo Bock, Google&rsquo;s SVP of People Operations, said that &ldquo;hiring only several thousand of the 2 million applicants makes Google 25 times more selective than Harvard, Yale, or Princeton.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s no secret that the search engine giant continues to attract and retain the most talented, hardworking people among its roster of employees. So, how does Google manage to choose the cream of the crop among millions of aspiring applicants? Here&rsquo;s how.</p><h3> <strong>  Never Compromise on Quality </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is one of the cornerstones of a high-performing company that is populated with high-quality employees. Aside from establishing a high bar for quality, Bock makes sure that Google retains its high standards by taking the hiring decisions away from its managers. These decisions are placed squarely on the shoulders of an independent committee that has been trained to objectively review interview results.</p><h3> <strong>  Follow a Structured Interview </strong></h3><p> <br/> Most unstructured interviews are prone to confirmation bias in which snap decisions lead to hiring the wrong people despite the interviewer&rsquo;s best intentions. A study conducted in 2000 by two psychology students at the University of Toledo confirmed that judgements made in the first ten seconds of an interview will predict the outcome, which are usually based on biases and beliefs that have nothing to do with the candidate&rsquo;s competence.</p><p> To combat this tendency, Google asks the same set of questions on a consistent basis, and the quality of responses are assessed based on a particular, clear set of criteria.</p><h3> <strong>  Give Them a Reason to Work for You </strong></h3><p> <br/> The best candidates are not solely motivated by excellent perks or a fat paycheck. See to it that you can align your company mission with a candidate&rsquo;s desire for meaningful work.</p><p> Bock says that &ldquo;It comes down to meaning. Work for most people is a mediocre experience, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. All of us want our work to mean something.&rdquo;</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> <strong>  Focus on Making People Happy </strong></h3><p> <br/> Google encourages its employees to use a percentage of their time to pursue whatever they want. Bock says that &ldquo;We put a lot of time and effort to work at Google into making this a place where you can be who you are; we give our people tremendous freedom. And we underpin our people practices with real science and data. We use science to figure out what makes teams work.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Hire Those Who Will Thrive in Your Company Culture </strong></h3><p> <br/> Take the time to come up with a well-defined company culture, and communicate this clearly within the organization. Google has taken this a step further by putting a Chief of Culture as a C-suite role, a position held by Stacy Sullivan. Her main job is to see to it that &ldquo;Google&rsquo;s culture stays true to itself.&rdquo;</p><p> As recruiters, you are expected to draw connections between the available job openings and the talent you want to fill those roles. At  <a href=\"http://www.manilarecruitment.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Manila Recruitment </a> , we&rsquo;ve pooled together the best talents in every industry, where you&rsquo;re bound to find the perfect candidate to join your organization. <br/>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-01 16:01:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-01 16:01:30.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_seeRjX2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-hiring-secrets-from-google/\", \"post_id\": \"12906\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-01 16:01:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-01 16:01:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-hiring-secrets-from-google\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12905\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6260\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/5-hiring-secrets-google.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"746\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470164400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":6020,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Owning Passive ETF's Doesn't Make You Passive","link":"owning-passive-etfs-doesnt-make-you-passive","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Within the investment industry, there is an ongoing debate about the efficacies of passive and active investing. Vanguard has been one of the more vocal participants in evaluating active managers and the consequences of stock-based investment strategies. Academic research into the matter confirms Vanguard&rsquo;s hypothesis: Most managers that claim to be active are not consistently adding value to the market return. Each year is pronounced the year that active management will win, but this is rarely the case.</p><h3> Why does active management seem to be so ineffective at beating the market?</h3><p> <br/> The majority of the investment community attempts to add value by selecting individual stocks. Investors weigh one company or theme more than others. Investment managers spend their time searching for inefficiencies in the valuation of individual companies in order to outperform the market.  However, much like any free market, the more individuals focus on finding inefficiencies, the fewer inefficiencies there are to exploit.  It therefore comes as no surprise that the significant research staff and budgets of the largest mutual fund complexes are unable to outperform a passive collection of stocks: their size and past success has resulted in an efficient market.</p><p> Is the only solution then a static allocation of passive, market-weighted investments?  No &mdash; inefficiencies will always exist.  Therefore, the plan should be to seek out inefficiencies and exploit them.  With nearly everyone fishing the same pond for individual company opportunities, it might serve investors to look for fishermen that have elected to change ponds and fish where ample opportunities exist. </p><p> Research consistently shows that the two largest components to long-term investment return are market participation and asset allocation.  However, very few of the large firms focus on those factors.  Instead, they focus almost all of their attention on finding the next Google, Proctor &amp; Gamble, or Home Depot.  This issue was highlighted in a CNBC panel on October 20 th , 2015 with leaders from three prominent mutual fund families.  They all promoted active management, focusing on stock selection and argued that 2015 was the year of the stock picker.  When the host asked if they ever make asset allocation calls or market participation calls, the CEO of one said they leave that decision to the client .  These three large investment firms readily admitted to leaving the two most important investment decisions to the client.</p><p> As a result, there is no question as to why the mutual fund industry continues to see asset losses. The industry&rsquo;s leaders are unable to grasp the real needs of the individual.  Studies show that individual clients lose over 2% a year in annual return because they get scared out of the market at the worse time and reinvest at higher prices.  Over 25% of the hoped-for return in the equity market is lost to mistiming, yet the investment industry seemed unable to restructure itself&hellip; until recently.</p><p> The financial crisis of 2008 was a wakeup call to investors and some forward-thinking asset managers. The historical method &mdash; static allocation of diversified assets throughout the business cycle &mdash; was found to be flawed.  Diversification, the idea that a broad mix of asset classes will protect investors against material losses during market downturns, was proven wrong when almost all asset class returns went negative.  Diversification failed when it was needed most, creating a crisis of confidence.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Being Active with Passive Vehicles</h3><p> <br/> With the recession fresh in everyone&rsquo;s minds, the idea that modern portfolio theory (MPT) was the solution to all investment problems was called into question.  Research suggests that many of the inputs required for the application of MPT change throughout the economic cycle, leading to inefficiencies in portfolio positioning in the various stages of the cycle.  Because many larger investment firms have not embraced this realization, new firms have been the ones to pioneer the approach.  Using the knowledge that portfolio positioning should reflect the different phases of economic growth, these firms spend their time determining those phases and the asset allocations that improve their clients&rsquo; chances of succeeding throughout the cycle.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/active-passive.png\" width=\"680\"/></p><p> The implementation of this process, which involves adjusting asset allocations based on economic cycle phases, draws investment focus to areas where inefficiencies are greatest: market participation and asset allocation.  Firms advancing this process do not waste time on the unproductive goal of determining which companies will outperform.  Instead, firms obtain exposure to the desired asset class or style by using lower-cost, passively based investment funds. </p><p> In this new era, the debate over active versus passive management is becoming obsolete.  Rising firms are active participants, choosing to focus on elements where inefficiency can be captured and accretive to client returns. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 14:41:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 14:41:02.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_oCFOqBo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/owning-passive-etfs-doesnt-make-you-passive/\", \"post_id\": \"12911\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 14:41:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 14:41:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"owning-passive-etfs-doesnt-make-you-passive\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12909\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6262\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/owning-passive-etf-s-doesn-t-make-you-passive.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"800\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470211200,"author_id":247,"chart_url":""}

There are others such as contextual commerce, voice recognition and digital assistants, but machine learning and blockchain are top of mind.</p><p> His response was that machine learning was higher priority than blockchain. It was almost like if you had to invest in one thing, then the one thing he would choose is machine learning. It was like an either/or discussion, where I tried to turn it around into a discussion of both. My belief is both areas should be a priority for a bank. Why would you ignore blockchain?</p><p> His answer intrigued me. His answer was that blockchain is not essential right now as it&rsquo;s a nascent technology with no proven usage. The bank can wait for a while before investing in it, and can catch up fast when needed. However, machine learning could give the bank immediate benefits in improving workflows and processes.  Machine learning could save costs and overheads and was right here, right now.</p><p> I agree with this view, but disagree with the idea of waiting on blockchain. Why? Because blockchain is going to drive an essential rethinking of our industry structure.  If you wait and watch, you miss the chance to guide those industry structures.2  Would you rather lead change or follow the leaders who changed everything?  However, it seemed obvious that he wasn&rsquo;t going to change position and, bearing in mind that I&rsquo;ve said it will be a decade before blockchain is mainstream, maybe he&rsquo;s right for his bank.</p><p> It made me realise that I haven&rsquo;t discussed machine learning enough on the blog as well. I&rsquo;ve given a few deep dives:</p><li> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/04/paypals-use-of-deep-learning-to-fight-fraud.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The use of deep learning to combat fraud  </a></li><li> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/10/theres-lots-and-lots-of-chat-about-ai-artificial-intelligence-in-banking-using-deep-data-analytics-to-augment-our-financ.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The imminent world of artificially intelligent everything </a></li><li> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2016/03/the-incredible-hulk-in-a-swift-showdown.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Incredible Hulk in a SWIFT showdown  </a></li><p> But I haven&rsquo;t focused upon the real financial areas of usage, which from my limited knowledge is primarily in improving service to high net worth (HNW) clients.  I say that as the only early discussions I&rsquo;ve seen publicly about machine learning in banking has been the use of IBM&rsquo;s Watson in DBS and UBS.  Both banks have talked about how Watson can analyse the client&rsquo;s portfolio of investments and risk appetite, so that when a HNW client opens their app, they get a personal recommendation in real-time.</p><p> DBS in particular is notable, as they&rsquo;ve won quite a lot of awards for their innovations including world&rsquo;s best digital bank. And no, this is not an advert for DBS, but it is notable that their CEO, Piyush Gupta, started his professional life gaining responsibility for IT, Strategy, Fiknance and Human Resources as Chief of Staff in Citibank India .   He understands the power of tech.</p><p> Anyways, I was trying to think of other areas we could talk about machine learning in banking, and there are actually loads. Here&rsquo;s just a few examples:</p><h3> From an IBM report: <br/>  </h3><p> A team of researchers in the Machine Learning Technologies group at IBM Research &ndash; Haifa are taking fraud prevention and detection to a new level with the IBM Detecting Fraud in Financial Transactions solution.</p><p> Rather than singling out specific types of transactions, the solution analyzes historical transaction data to build a model that can detect fraudulent patterns. This model is then used to process and analyze a large amount of financial transactions as they happen in real time, also known as stream computing.</p><p> Each transaction is given a fraud score, which represents the probability of a transaction being fraudulent. The model is first customized to the client&rsquo;s data and then updated periodically to cover new fraud patterns. The underlying analytics rely on statistical analysis and machine learning methods, some of the same techniques as used by IBM&rsquo;s Watson.</p><h3> From an MIT Technology Review: <br/>  </h3><p> USAA, just one early adopter, has been testing ways to use AI to fine-tune its detection of identity theft. Its system looks for patterns that don&rsquo;t match a customer&rsquo;s typical behavior and identifies those anomalies even on the first instance, Welborn says. Traditional systems wouldn&rsquo;t catch a new pattern of crime until the second time it happened. &ldquo;Our learning systems are really good at understanding things that look like fraud,&rdquo; he says.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Another project being tested at USAA tries to improve customer service. It involves an AI technology built by Saffron, a division of Intel, using an approach designed to mimic the randomness of the connections made by the human brain. By combining 7,000 different factors, the technology can match broad patterns of customer behavior to that of specific members, and 88 percent of the time it can correctly predict things like how certain people might next contact USAA (Web? phone? e-mail?) and what products they will be looking for when they do. Without the AI, USAA&rsquo;s systems were guessing right 50 percent of the time. That test is now being expanded.</p><h3> From a McKinsey white paper: <br/>  </h3><p> In Europe, more than a dozen banks have replaced older statistical-modeling approaches with machine-learning techniques and, in some cases, experienced 10 percent increases in sales of new products, 20 percent savings in capital expenditures, 20 percent increases in cash collections, and 20 percent declines in churn. The banks have achieved these gains by devising new recommendation engines for clients in retailing and in small and medium-sized companies. They have also built microtargeted models that more accurately forecast who will cancel service or default on their loans, and how best to intervene &hellip;</p><p> An international bank concerned about the scale of defaults in its retail business recently identified a group of customers who had suddenly switched from using credit cards during the day to using them in the middle of the night. That pattern was accompanied by a steep decrease in their savings rate. After consulting branch managers, the bank further discovered that the people behaving in this way were also coping with some recent stressful event. As a result, all customers tagged by the algorithm as members of that microsegment were automatically given a new limit on their credit cards and offered financial advice.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> From a Waters Technology feature: <br/>  </h3><p> Lauren Crossett, director of business development at Rebellion Research, considered one of the leading AI quant funds in the US, said that even though errors are made, they have to trust the AI and not override it.</p><p> &ldquo;We might look at all the other funds that sold out when something starts to go down and say, &lsquo;Ok, well we know where the fork was in the road. Let&rsquo;s see how it comes out,&rdquo; Crossett said. &ldquo;We pretty much depend on what the AI said. It&rsquo;s not to say if we think there is something wrong with the data we&rsquo;re not going to rerun the system. But we&rsquo;re not going to say, &lsquo;Hey, I have a good feeling about this, so let&rsquo;s overweigh something.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re not going to do that.&rdquo;</p><p> Erez Katz, CEO of Lucena Research, which provides predictive analytics using machine-learning technology, adds that the benefit of these platforms is that it takes human emotion out of play, which can be beneficial when it comes to execution as opposed to research.</p><p> &ldquo;Machine learning takes the human&rsquo;s emotion out of the equation,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very important because human psychology plays an important role in most investment decisions and it often does a disservice even to the most seasoned portfolio managers. Active investors, whether they admit it or not, often buy a stock for the wrong reasons and exit under duress due to their lack of confidence in their initial decision to enter. Having a scientific backing provides the statistical affirmation and confidence in a trade, but more importantly, it eliminates the emotional angle of the decision process.&rdquo;</p><p> Obviously, the list could go on and on and on, but the last example is a pretty important one, as we have long tried to replace human traders with machines.  This is referred to as active (human) versus passive (machine) trading systems.  With high-frequency trading (AI) and other techniques, combined with machine learning and AI, we could eradicate the need for human traders.</p><p> In a report this week in The Financial Times, active managers whose funds must try to beat the market rather than simply track the index, are facing something approaching a crisis. A majority fail to beat the index over any significant period, and most of those that do ultimately find their outperformance to be fleeting. New competitors are claiming any insight they actually possess can be replicated by a computer. Clients are shifting en masse to index-based funds &mdash; active funds have lost $213bn in assets in the year to the end of May, Morningstar says, while passive funds took in $240bn. Profit margins, traditionally among the best in the finance world, are under threat and it seems only a matter of time before there is pressure on managers&rsquo; pay &hellip; only 15 per cent of active managers are persistent market-beaters.</p><p> That is a good reason to get rid of humans in trading.  According to a recent Tabb Group report, computers will replace humans entirely in the trading room, because the skin and blood brigade are expensive and prone to error.  Financial market participants currently spend more than three times more on people than they do on hardware, software and data, according to the report.  This does not mean we end up no humans in trading however, as there will be new jobs created for those who can build and control the technology.</p><p> In another report by Aite Group in 2014, foreign exchange (FX) trading accounted for 20% of the markets in 2001, 66% in 2013 and rising to 76% by 2018. About 81% of spot trading &mdash; the buying and selling of currency for immediate delivery &mdash; will be electronic by 2018.</p><p> We can see this shift to electronification of markets across the gamete of everything from FX to equities to structure products to wealth management to advice to service and more.  However, with all this change there may still be a place for human traders that can beat the machines.  It&rsquo;s a different game though.</p><p> In another Financial Times discussion of the area, they quote Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management and The Reformed Broker blog.  At certain times, humans have the advantage, he says. &ldquo;The new game for traders is not running away from rapacious algos.Instead, it&rsquo;s going to become about exploiting their failure to reason.&rdquo;</p><p> Monday August 24 was one such day. Nasdaq opened limit down, partly because traders were so spooked by a plunge in Chinese shares the night before. There was virtually no volume, and individual shares plunged with no news to account for the fall. KKR was down more than 60%, mighty GE down 20%.  As volatility spiked beyond the ranges they had been programmed for, the high-frequency traders, the so-called robo traders and the stat arbs did what they were supposed to do, they unplugged and stopped trading. &ldquo;Volatility shy trading programs have been programmed to de-risk when prices get wild, period,&rdquo; the Reformed Broker blog notes. On August 24 &ldquo;it paid to ask questions first. Unfortunately, that function isn&rsquo;t in the code.&rdquo;</p><p> Those who did ask questions would have seen that it was impossible for GE, say, to be down 20 per cent when some index products were down far less and could have made a killing exploiting that discrepancy. Similarly, by using better data it is also still possible for humans to make money.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 14:41:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 14:41:02.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_PmP1ZLp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/machines-that-learn-will-decimate-human-jobs-or-will-they/\", \"post_id\": \"12913\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 14:41:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 14:41:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"machines-that-learn-will-decimate-human-jobs-or-will-they\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12912\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6263\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/machines-learn-will-decimate-human-jobs-or-will-they.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"383\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470214800,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6022,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Looking for Yield in All the Wrong Places?","link":"are-you-looking-for-yield-in-all-the-wrong-places","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Fixed-income isn&rsquo;t what it used to be. <br/>  </h3><p> As the Wall Street Journal reports, the total amount of global government bonds that bear negative yields&mdash;meaning it costs you to have the government hold your money&mdash;has now climbed to a massive $13 trillion.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Global-Negative-Yielding-Debt-Climbs-13-Trillion.png\" width=\"350\"/></p><p> This figure is likely to grow as yields continue to plumb the depths of negative territory, giving global investors little choice but to seek income elsewhere.</p><p> For some, it&rsquo;s corporate debt. But even these securities have fallen significantly since the start of the year, many below zero. Bloomberg reports that roughly $512 billion worth of European, investment-grade corporate bonds now offer a negative yield.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not much better in the U.S. Blue chip Walt Disney just issued a 10-year bond with the low, low yield of 1.85 percent.</p><p> For other investors, it&rsquo;s American municipal bonds, which still offer attractive, tax-free income, not to mention low volatility and low default rates. Back in May, I shared with you how yield-starved foreign investors were piling into munis at an impressive clip, even though they&rsquo;re ineligible to take advantage of the tax benefit. But no matter&mdash;at least it&rsquo;s not costing them to participate, unlike a growing percentage of negative-yielding government debt.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Negative bond yields have also boosted demand for gold, which has had two of the most spectacular quarters in modern history. Although it doesn&rsquo;t provide any income, the yellow metal has been treasured as an exceptional store of value, especially in times of political and macroeconomic uncertainty. Gold stocks are up more than 115 percent year-to-date, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index and Swiss financial services firm UBS puts gold prices near $1,400 by year&rsquo;s end.</p><p> (Gold prices are also being supported right now by the likelihood that we&rsquo;ve reached &ldquo;peak gold.&rdquo; According to my friend Pierre Lassonde, cofounder of Franco-Nevada, new discoveries have fallen steadily since the 1980s, while current mine production has not kept up with demand.)</p><h3> Are Stocks the New Bonds? <br/>  </h3><p> The hunt for yield has also inevitably landed many income investors in dividend-paying stocks. According to Reuters, about 60 percent of S&amp;P 500 Index stocks now offer dividend yields that exceed the 10-year Treasury yield, which hit an all-time low of 1.36 percent earlier this month.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-07-29/COMM-Dividend-Paying-Stocks-Looking-Even-More-Attractive-07292016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Dividend Paying Stocks Looking Even More Attractive\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-07-29/COMM-Dividend-Paying-Stocks-Looking-Even-More-Attractive-07292016.png\"/> </a> <br/>  </p><p> This is one of the main reasons why recent cash flows into U.S.-based stock funds have been so strong. Money goes where it&rsquo;s most respected. In the week ended July 13, ETF and mutual fund equity funds took in a whopping $33.5 billion in net new money, the largest positive weekly net inflow of the year.</p><p> Meanwhile, Treasury bond funds have been witness to some huge outflows this year. For the week ended July 25, the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF lost $90.5 million. Back in April, foreign investors unloaded nearly $75 billion in U.S. Treasuries, the single largest monthly amount since transactional recordkeeping began in 1978.</p><h3> Increasing Dividends over the Past Three Years <br/>  </h3><p> In selecting the best dividend-paying stocks, we like to identify those that have grown their payments the most over the past three years. Using that metric, the leader by far right now is Alabama-based Vulcan Materials, which has increased its dividend a jaw-dropping 1,900 percent, according to FactSet data. Many financial groups, including Regions Financial and Zions Bancorporation, have also been very generous in rewarding shareholders.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"353\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SP-500-Index-Companies-with-Largest-Dividend-Growth.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> The challenge going forward has to do with corporate earnings. Dividend growth is largely driven by earnings, which are expected to be down 3.7 percent in the second quarter once all companies have reported. This will mark the sixth consecutive quarter of declines.</p><p> Energy stocks lead the way down, with crude oil prices at nearly three-month lows after falling over 20 percent since early June.</p><p> Apple is perhaps the largest contributor to declines this quarter. The iPhone-maker posted net income of $7.8 billion, a massive 27 percent drop from the $10.7 billion it recorded during the same period last year.</p><p> But let&rsquo;s give the tech giant a break&mdash;it just sold its one billionth iPhone last week, despite a decrease in sales for the second straight quarter. I must also add here that Apple is the undisputed dividend king, having paid out $2.9 billion in the first quarter alone.</p><p> Standouts this earnings season included Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet (Google)&mdash;three-quarters of the FANG tech stocks&mdash;all of which crushed expectations. Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s social media giant handily beat analysts&rsquo; estimates on the top and bottom lines as well as ad revenue, which totaled $6.2 billion during the quarter. This helped add $5 billion to Facebook&rsquo;s market capitalization, pushing it ahead of Warren Buffett&rsquo;s Berkshire Hathaway.</p><p> Buffett was also surpassed last week by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose wealth leaped $2.6 billion after an extraordinary earnings report. He&rsquo;s now the world&rsquo;s third-richest man, ahead of the Oracle of Omaha.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/category/learn/global\"/></p><p> Netflix, on the other hand, reported a disappointing 59 percent loss in profits, from $40.5 million in the first quarter to $16.7 million. The popular streaming service added only 1.7 million subscribers during the quarter, far below its guidance of 2.5 million.</p><p> ##PAGE_BREAK##</p><h3> Banks on the Chopping Block? <br/>  </h3><p> Well, there&rsquo;s no questioning it now: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have both been anointed as our presidential candidates. Many wondered if Bernie Sanders would try to disrupt the nomination process and insist on a brokered convention, similar to what Franklin Roosevelt did in 1932. Sanders&rsquo; supporters certainly put up a fight, but in the end, Clinton prevailed.</p><p> This week before last, I suggested that the only thing Trump and Clinton have in common with each other is they&rsquo;re both in favor of increasing infrastructure spending. It&rsquo;s now come to my attention that no matter who wins, there could be an effort to break up the big banks, as both parties&rsquo; platforms include an interest in reviving the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The goal, of course, would be to prevent another financial crisis, but whether the banking act would actually work is up for debate.</p><p> Another solution might be to break up the regulatory bodies into two separate branches&mdash;one overseeing banks, the other overseeing all other financial and investment institutions, from brokers to insurance companies to mutual fund companies. Each side would have its own unique set of rules and regulations. What&rsquo;s good for banks isn&rsquo;t necessarily good for investment firms, and vice versa, because they&rsquo;re often playing very different games.</p><p> Think of it this way: We expect referees to be experts in their particular sport. That only makes sense. But imagine if all competitive sports, from basketball to hockey to softball, suddenly drew from the same pool of referees. Games would be conducted a lot less efficiently. Officials would constantly be putting on and taking off different hats. One game&rsquo;s set of rules might mistakenly (and awkwardly) be applied to a completely different game.</p><p> This is what&rsquo;s happening in the financials industry as a whole.</p><p> As I always say, regulations are often well-intentioned. There&rsquo;s a reason why they exist. We need them to maintain a level and fair playing field.</p><p> At the same time, it&rsquo;s important that they be common sense and not hinder or prohibit everyday, lawful business activity.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 14:43:31.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 14:43:31.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_idNsQzs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-looking-for-yield-in-all-the-wrong-places/\", \"post_id\": \"12917\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 14:43:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 14:43:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-looking-for-yield-in-all-the-wrong-places\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12914\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6264\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/are-you-looking-yield-all-wrong-places.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"994\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470218400,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":6023,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want to Live at Home Long Into Retirement? Create Your Own Plan Now for Old Age","link":"want-to-live-at-home-long-into-retirement-create-your-own-plan-now-for-old-age","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> When most of us hear &ldquo;long-term health care plan,&rdquo; we think of insurance. Not necessarily so. <br/>  </h3><p> While a LTCI policy may be part of your health care planning, it isn&rsquo;t a plan. Even those who don&rsquo;t need such insurance need a long-term health care plan.</p><p> I recently heard a presentation by Carolyn McClanahan, MD, CFP. She says about 70% of Americans will need some type of long-term care. Your odds of needing it increase as you get older and are also higher if you are female, have a family history of chronic health conditions, have a poor diet, don&rsquo;t exercise, or live alone.</p><p> Two major issues to consider in creating your own long-term care plan are where you will live and how you will pay for the care you are likely to need.</p><p> Most seniors want to live in their own homes &ldquo;until their toenails turn blue,&rdquo; as Dr. McClanahan puts it.</p><p> No matter how appealing this is, it may not be realistic. Here are some important items she says to consider that can make your home old-age friendly:</p><li> Close proximity and access to needed services like grocery stores, restaurants, and medical facilities</li><li> Available interaction with others</li><li> A plan for home maintenance</li><li> Accessibility for wheelchairs and walkers</li><li> Minimal stairs, level surfaces, and the ability to accommodate ramps inside and out</li><li> Non-skid floors, baths, and showers</li><li> Grab bars and easy to reach utilities</li><li> Cameras at floor levels (the least intrusive) to monitor your activity</li><li> Whether the home can be dementia proofed</li><li> Whether in-home medical and support services are available, you are willing to use them, and you can afford them.</li><p> Even with a goal of staying in your home, your plan should specify how to determine if it&rsquo;s time for you to move into a long-term care facility: perhaps when friends or family feel it&rsquo;s a safety issue, you can no longer perform certain functions, or transportation becomes an issue.</p><p> The second large concern, of course, is how to pay for long-term health care. This is where LTC insurance can come in handy, but it is expensive and often doesn&rsquo;t cover all the costs. Paid care includes nursing facilities, which are the most expensive alternatives, followed by assisted living facilities, independent living apartments, adult day care, and in-home care.</p><p> However, most long-term health care is unpaid. In 2015, 34.2 million adults provided unpaid health care services to seniors, with a value of $522 billion. Half of them, or 17.1 million people, do so because they have no other choice. The average caregiver spends 24 hours a week providing care, with 25% of them spending over 40 hours a week, and will serve in this role for an average of four years.

Many of us feel that by not talking about long-term care planning it somehow won&rsquo;t become a reality. The ultimate reality is that, by not planning, most elders and their caregivers will have few to no options when they need care. Creating your own long-term health care plan before you need it can increase your options and help you live out your life with more comfort and dignity.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 14:44:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 14:44:52.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_tif9Xog.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-to-live-at-home-long-into-retirement-create-your-own-plan-now-for-old-age/\", \"post_id\": \"12919\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 14:44:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 14:44:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-to-live-at-home-long-into-retirement-create-your-own-plan-now-for-old-age\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12918\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6265\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/want-live-home-long-retirement-create-your-own-plan-now-old-age.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"837\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470225600,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

Various fun activities can be done to allow people to see one another in a different light and to connect in a different setting. When done properly, team building activities will enable workers or employees to deliver great results that benefit a company's bottom line.</p><h3> Here are the 6 biggest benefits that your team can get from team building or bonding programs: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Team building allows workers to socialize and get to know each other better <br/>  </h3><p> One of the most effective ways leaders like you can boost productivity in the workplace is to allow your employees to socialize and make friends. Building friendly relationships at work will not just boost morale in the office, but it will also equip your employees with better skills for solving different issues in the workplace.</p><h3> 2. Team building programs boost team performance and promote teamwork <br/>  </h3><p> After completing various team building activities together, workers are able to have a better understanding of each other's weaknesses, strengths, and even interests. Having this knowledge and understanding then allows them to work together better, especially on projects that matter to the growth and success of the organization.</p><h3> 3. Team building activities promote healthy competition <br/>  </h3><p> According to studies, competition can lead to increased productivity. What's important is for team members to engage in a healthy competition. This means that the goal of the competition is to challenge team members and encourage them to show their best abilities. This kind of competition does not entertain envy, jealousy or insecurity.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 4. Team building programs allow workers to have fun and celebrate <br/>  </h3><p> After teams win, of course, they celebrate and have fun. This is a huge motivation for them to want to win more! When your employees know how it feels to win, they would naturally have the urge and motivation to strive to be better. As we all know, winning is a feeling that never grows old.</p><h3> 5. Team building activities allow for collaboration and the fostering of creativity <br/>  </h3><p> When people are surrounded by those they are comfortable with, they tend to be more creative and resourceful. Successful team building activities do not just cause people to be closer to one another, they also encourage team members to think more creatively. And of course, collaboration in the workplace is essential for business success.</p><h3> 6. Team building programs enhance communication among team members <br/>  </h3><p> One of the biggest reasons why team building activities are a must in any organization is the fact that they enable people to develop better communication skills.</p><p> In a friendly and relaxed environment, people become more comfortable and they feel happier to communicate with one another, which is something they can bring to their actual workplace.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 14:47:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 14:47:11.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_GmtR46i.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-6-biggest-benefits-your-team-can-get-from-bonding-programs/\", \"post_id\": \"12921\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 14:47:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 14:47:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-6-biggest-benefits-your-team-can-get-from-bonding-programs\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12920\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6266\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/6-biggest-benefits-your-team-can-get-bonding-programs.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"664\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470250800,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}

Always be on the lookout for talent; don&rsquo;t wait until someone quits or the firm has reached capacity.</p><p> Bad hiring decisions cost a firm in real dollars as well as lost productivity; you also risk having a negative impact on your most prized assets: your client relationships.</p><h3> Here are a few common hiring mistakes to steer clear of: <br/>  </h3><p> 1. Don&rsquo;t hire someone who lacks industry experience and critical skill sets. The only time you should make an inexperienced hire is if you have an established intern program; for all other situations, you need to hire someone who can hit the ground running.</p><p> 2. Don&rsquo;t only hire prospects who are a mirror image of you. Rather, find candidates who have complementary skill sets and backgrounds to your own.  This will bring a variety of perspectives and skills, which is  invaluable to building a successful business.</p><p> 3. Don&rsquo;t rush the process. Hiring the first candidate you interview out of desperation &mdash; just because you want to get someone in place &mdash; is a recipe for failure. Take the time to find a candidate with the right skill set and experience level.</p><p> 4. Don&rsquo;t hire a candidate who doesn&rsquo;t match your firm&rsquo;s culture. Skills are teachable; values are not.</p><p> 5. Don&rsquo;t hold out for perfect candidates &mdash; they don&rsquo;t exist. Compromise on skills that can be taught on the job, but don&rsquo;t budge on the characteristics and traits that matter the most to your team&rsquo;s success.</p><p> 6. Don&rsquo;t skimp on the interview process. Make sure that all of your key employees interview the candidate and support the hire.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> 7. Don&rsquo;t upend your compensation structure for a candidate who doesn&rsquo;t fit with your existing setup. Make sure you understand the current talent market &mdash; but then establish a compensation philosophy and structure that rewards advisors fairly and competitively for their roles and contributions to firm success, and stick with it.</p><p> 8. Don&rsquo;t forget to onboard the new hire. Develop a strategic process for bringing a new employee into the organization, providing information, training, mentoring and coaching throughout the transition. Effective onboarding is good for a new employee and good for the firm. It should begin as soon as your offer has been accepted and continue throughout the first year of employment.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 14:48:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 14:48:53.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_ATNQWFj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-most-common-hiring-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them/\", \"post_id\": \"12923\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 14:48:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 14:48:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-most-common-hiring-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12922\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6267\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/most-common-hiring-mistakes-and-how-avoid-them.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"379\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470218400,"author_id":270,"chart_url":""}

But with so much to do, how do you make that time?</p><p> One of the best ways to gain back some time is to focus on a limited number of products and investment options. A conversation I had with a mutual fund national sales manager last week highlighted the problem and solution: she said the greatest challenge she saw among advisors was overloading their plates by offering too many products and platforms, leaving them little time to focus on client relationships.</p><p> As a coaching client was recently about to leave for his company&rsquo;s annual conference, we had been discussing his talking to different vendors there about their offerings. Wisely, he said he was finding himself less and less interested in hearing about other products.</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent a good amount of energy and time selecting our mix, and I know exactly why we include what we offer,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s working well, and I need to stay focused on a limited, yet effective offering so I can put more focus on servicing clients. I know that what we have is most useful for us right now, and so I&rsquo;m not wanting to spend time considering other options.&rdquo;</p><p> My client had judiciously made his platform choices and was sticking with them. Looking into all the various products available may seem like a good idea &ndash; but if you have products and a process that is working for you, it&rsquo;s really wasted time you could be using elsewhere.</p><p> Resist the temptation to continually add new products. By staying focused, you can more easily scale your business and add new clients. You&rsquo;ll also develop deeper conviction for what you offer and how you help people.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> So, if you&rsquo;re feeling stretched with trying to monitor too many items and wondering how you can find valuable time to spend building relationships with your clients:</p><li> Stop mindlessly expanding. Decide that any new client who begins with you needs to adhere to your investment models and rational. Continuing to bring in more and more broadly allocated assets and simply keeping them in your mix will soon have you stretched too thin, just trying to monitor everything.</li><li> Develop core investment models. Develop your rationale so you know what you offer and why. This knowledge will help you stick to your focused business approach and the models you have chosen.</li><li> Review your book. Strategically seek opportunities to move more clients into your models. You&rsquo;ll have fewer varieties of investments to monitor, allowing you to better leverage your time by directing more of it to relationship management.</li><p> By staying focused on what you provide, you&rsquo;ll have more time to devote to what matters most &ndash; your relationships with your clients.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 14:51:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 14:51:25.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_yUMq2fB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-is-offering-more-hurting-your-business-relationships/\", \"post_id\": \"12925\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 14:51:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 14:51:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-is-offering-more-hurting-your-business-relationships\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12924\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6268\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/advisors-offering-more-hurting-your-business-relationships.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"664\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470214800,"author_id":378,"chart_url":""}

I was asked this question again just this week.  <br/>  </h3><p> During one of our public LinkedIn classes, one of the challenges that was brought up was the issue of follow up with your LinkedIn connections.  The student in the class said, &ldquo;I only connect with the people that make sense for me to connect with, but how do I engage with so many people on a regular basis?  I&rsquo;m not sure where to even begin with my 500+ connections.&rdquo;</p><p> This was not the first time this question was asked&hellip; and it will certainly not be the last time. You need a process. Let&rsquo;s take the process from the beginning.</p><p> First of all, I whole-heartedly believe that your network is your net-worth&hellip; digital or not digital. Let&rsquo;s start with etiquette. Always take the 30 seconds it takes to write 300 characters in a connection request.  Generic connection requests tell me that I am not important enough for 30 seconds of your time.  What does that tell me about our relationships going forward?  Not much.</p><p> When I do receive a generic connection request, they go to the bottom of my list.  But my intention on LinkedIn is to OPEN THE DIALOGUE. So I reply to the connection request without accepting it in order to investigate what prompted the request at that moment? OPEN THE DIALOGUE, folks.  Be purposeful I your actions ;)</p><p> If everyone always made their intentions clear from the start (with the connection request), and then engaged in dialogue right off the bat&hellip; well, I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t need these tips! </p><p> But now I&rsquo;ve got you thinking&hellip;you haven&rsquo;t been doing this all along so what happens now?  Do you wipe the list clean and start over with more purpose and intention?  Ha!  Who has the time?!?!</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> No&hellip; just start tagging your network, then engage based on the tag.  For example, you might want to tag your network by prospects, clients, referral partners, centers-of-influence, thought leaders, business partners, etc.  Or maybe you might want to tag them by location, if you travel frequently, or by title if you need to engage based on level of decision making, or by networking association, or by however you feel you should silo your network in order to purposefully contact them.</p><p> Once tagged, sort by the tag, and engage by the type of dialogue you are intending to open.  Yes, this takes work.  Yes, you will be busy for quite some time.  Yes, it will be worth the effort!</p><p> Check out this short instruction video on how to tag your connections:</p><p>  </p><p> Now get to work!

If you give care to a loved one, take steps each day to preserve your health and well-being.</p><p> Caregiving offers many rewards and just being there for another when needed is a core value. But being on call repetitively drags a person down and fosters extra pressure. You have enough to worry about; kids, a spouse, a job, yard work, and upkeep around the home. When do you have time for yourself?</p><h3> Here are ideas that can save time and reduce stress: <br/>  </h3><li> When dealing with medical issues, complete the simple ones first. Confirm medical appointments the day before to find out if the healthcare team is ready to discuss test results. Doing so saves time and avoids two visits to the doctor.</li><li> Use respite care to take a break by hiring a professional caregiver or get help from neighbors, friends, extended family, and church volunteers. Provide a list of tasks they can do like prepare a meal, or make a trip to the food market, pick up prescriptions, do the laundry, or offer your loved one a ride to the doctor. Manage the tasks by using Care Bridge or Lots of Helping Hands.</li><li> Learn to manage behavioral issues related to dementia. Time spent arguing and negotiating contributes to unnecessary stress and wastes time.</li><li> Make your workload lighter by keeping a list ready for the time when you hear someone say \"how can I help?\" Give them a job from the list. Everyone needs relief from time to time. Have conversations with your immediate family to divvy up responsibilities.</li><li> Slow Down! The care recipient will pick up on your feelings, and they will react. Also, when rushed, you may have to go back and do it all over again. So, slow down.</li><li> Set up as many routines, schedules, systems, shortcuts -- mainly, find an a tool to streamline the daily \"to-dos.\" They require set up but at the end of the day, you'll save a lot of time.</li><li> Reach out and find others who are in similar situations to gain support from one another. Having a support group who listens to your frustrations and emotions can relieve stress. Millions of people are caring for friends or family, which means millions of individuals can learn from each other.</li><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Know the signs of stress and burnout: <br/>  </h3><li> Anxiety, depression, irritability</li><li> Feeling tired and run down</li><li> Difficulty sleeping</li><li> Overreacting to minor nuisances</li><li> New or worsening health problems</li><li> Trouble concentrating</li><li> Feeling increasingly resentful</li><li> Drinking, smoking or eating more</li><li> Neglecting responsibilities</li><li> Cutting back on leisure activities</li><p> Once burned out, giving care is no longer a healthy option for you or the care.

{"original_id":6030,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Hot Blogging Tips for Every Financial Advisor","link":"6-hot-blogging-tips-for-every-financial-advisor","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Nowadays, it seems like everyone is blogging including doctors lawyers, designers, chefs and even financial advisors!</p><p> A blog gives you the opportunity to showcase your financial expertise, drive web traffic to your website, and attract new potential clients. However, it takes a great deal of thought, planning, and time commitment to create a truly effective blog.</p><h3> This is why we here at Bridge have created these six tips to keep in mind while blogging: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Identify an Audience <br/>  </h3><p> When blogging, it&rsquo;s important to identify a target audience and stick to it. Targeted, niche-market content will generate more buzz than vague, general content. Find a niche market that interests you, and focus on creating content targeted towards that audience. Some examples of niche markets include Millennials, Baby Boomers, Women, Doctors, Educators, Divorcees, etc. The more specific your audience, the better!</p><h3> 2. Create an Editorial Calendar <br/>  </h3><p> Take some time each month to sit down and decide what content you want to create for the month. This gives you the opportunity to be more thoughtful about what you&rsquo;re writing, rather than just writing about whatever pops into your head.  <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Trello </a>  is a an online software which allows you to create an editorial calendar quickly and easily, for free.</p><h3> 3. Repurpose Content <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s a good chance you already have a bunch of great blog post ideas sitting around in your inbox!  Spend some time each week flipping through your sent box, and look for answers you&rsquo;ve sent to client&rsquo;s questions. What are clients asking about? What do they want to know? This is great content for a blog. Look at the answers you&rsquo;ve sent clients and transform these into blog posts. It&rsquo;s less work for  you, plus you get more bang for your buck in terms of engaging content that your target audience wants to read.</p><h3> 4. Create Compelling Headlines <br/>  </h3><p> A compelling headline is key to increasing the audience of your posts. A good blog headline entices people to click, increasing the traffic you&rsquo;re driving back to your blog and website. Utilizing a headline analyzer like  <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CoSchedule </a>  can help make sure your headlines attract attention to your posts.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> 5. Consistency is Key <br/>  </h3><p> It sounds cliche, but consistency really is key when it comes to blogging. With a steady stream of content, people are more likely to return to your blog regularly. Create a goal for content creation, and stick to it. For example, aim to write and post one blog per week. Setting a goal will ensure you&rsquo;re consistently posting thoughtful, quality content.</p><h3> 6. Social Media <br/>  </h3><p> The most important (and perhaps most overlooked part of blogging) is creating a social media plan for how you&rsquo;re going to share your content. Blogging is social in nature, it&rsquo;s you creating and sharing content with the word in hopes that people will find it, read it, enjoy it, and want to explore your expertise further. By sharing your blog posts on social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, you make them easier to find, increasing your audience size and driving more traffic to your blog and website.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 15:00:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 15:00:13.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_KYpUeJl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-hot-blogging-tips-for-every-financial-advisor/\", \"post_id\": \"12933\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 15:00:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 15:00:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-hot-blogging-tips-for-every-financial-advisor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12932\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6272\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/6-hot-blogging-tips-every-financial-advisor.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"580\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470222000,"author_id":90,"chart_url":""}

Don't Be!","link":"concerned-about-being-different-and-fitting-in-with-clients-or-at-a-new-job-dont-be","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Uncertainty takes hold when we walk into a room of people far more experienced than us. And when we are surrounded by people who have very different experiences and perspectives than ours, many of us tend to say nothing. Instead we listen and take it all in.</p><p> Our reluctance to speak is partially due to the fact we don&rsquo;t want to reveal our seemingly lower level experience. The other part is we are initially uncertain as to which direction in conversation to take. So not a word is spoken. We listen. In the end, being quiet upfront proves to be the all time best route for career, interviews, client meetings and newly forming groups.</p><p> Being quiet sets the tone for serious conversation.</p><h3> My Story <br/>  </h3><p> A few months ago, a friend recommended me to participate in the newly formed Sales Enablement Council. Given I had just moved to the area, I readily agreed to attend the meeting in order to make new connections. Oh my&hellip;</p><p> The people in the room were nothing short of brilliant. Their work is to consult with top tier corporations around the world and improve their sales effort. The only commonality we have is my knowledge of sales itself. I continued to attend the meetings, with encouragement from the leader, to learn what I could from the best. Accordingly, I sat silently in these meetings. Deep down, I questioned why I continued to go.</p><p> Perseverance saved the day. The light finally came on as to how my knowledge would complement theirs. Opportunity presented was far greater than anything I could have imagined, and certainly could not be achieved on my own.</p><p> Being quiet allowed:</p><li> Understanding the other people in the room</li><li> Learning a new direction</li><li> Unique collaborative projects ahead</li><p> Quitting is never the answer, even when we are feeling most vulnerable. However, waiting the situation out to understand why we are there is the answer. In this case, silence is golden. Today, I finally spoke and noticed that the leader was taking notes all the while. It was the best compliment of all!</p><h3> Your Story <br/>  </h3><p> Many people have shared their reactions to similar situations. A few people admitted to nervous nonsense talking that turned off the others in the room. Most said they departed quickly and/or declined opportunities that scared them. They instead played it safe. But, in so doing they never advanced their capabilities.</p><p> So the question is, how do you handle such events and is there room for improvement? In the future, consider implementing the following:</p><li> Keep telling yourself &ldquo;you can do it&rdquo;.</li><li> Take careful notes in the meeting, and ask clarifying questions.</li><li> Repeat the process until you know 100% which direction to turn; continue or depart</li><p> Intuitively, we usually know the answer.  Equally important is to qualify and match the people in the room. Should they appear to hold similar values and principles for doing business, give the opportunity time to reveal itself in full. Being quiet in meetings allows for improved decision-making. Ultimately, you may not be as different as you originally thought.  Being of this mindset gives way for building sound relationships and establishment of a strong personal brand.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><h3> Tips: <br/>  </h3><li> Give every opportunity an opportunity</li><li> Listen for what is said and not being said</li><li> Ask questions regarding what appears to be overlooked</li><li> Between meetings research some of the topics</li><li> With newfound knowledge, begin adding to the meetings</li><li> Determine how your information is being received</li><li> Ask to meet over coffee with those who appear to have more in common</li><li> Volunteer to contribute once you see your niche</li><li> When everyone works as a team, the outcome vastly improves</li><li> Be seen as an active and valued member of the group</li><p> Following these guidelines will lead you to the Smooth Sale!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 15:04:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 15:04:40.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_g1AE5r2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/concerned-about-being-different-and-fitting-in-with-clients-or-at-a-new-job-dont-be/\", \"post_id\": \"12935\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 15:04:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 15:04:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"concerned-about-being-different-and-fitting-in-with-clients-or-at-a-new-job-dont-be\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12934\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6273\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/concerned-about-being-different-and-fitting-clients-or-new-job-dont-be.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"690\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470247200,"author_id":161,"chart_url":""}

Now that&rsquo;s a dramatic way to start a blog post!</h3><p> <br/> But it happens just that way.</p><p> You go to work, intending to do your level best at whatever your gig happens to be. Then you run across someone who operates in a fashion that you find despicable.</p><p> They behave like their method of operation is the norm. And perhaps it is. Or perhaps they&rsquo;ve never been set straight by their superiors.</p><p> Either way, they affect those around them for the worse.</p><p> <strong>  They gossip about others. </strong></p><p> <strong>  They pit people against each other. </strong></p><p> <strong>  They start or perpetuate rumors. </strong></p><p> <strong>  They cut corners. </strong></p><p> <strong>  They are dishonest. </strong></p><p> <strong>  They breed mistrust. </strong></p><p> <strong>  They cover-up mistakes. </strong></p><p> <strong>  They pee all over everything. </strong></p><p> <strong>  They attempt to pull you into their dysfunction. And that&rsquo;s when you get cut the first time. </strong></p><p> If you don&rsquo;t find a way to stop it you end up feeling miserable - a thousand cuts later - because you&rsquo;ve compromised your personal integrity, and just as bad, you&rsquo;ve become associated with the dysfunction they perpetuated and your reputation and relationships are damaged.</p><p> The best way to combat this is by setting a professional fence.</p><p> We have set professional fences dozens of times throughout our careers and they are VERY EFFECTIVE.</p><h3> So what is a professional fence you ask?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s kind of like one of those invisible fences people use for their dogs. The dog wears a collar and every time they get too close to the edge of the yard (that&rsquo;s where the invisible fence is) they get a little shock through the collar. Needless to say, they quickly learn not to cross that invisible boundary.</p><p> A professional fence is practically the same thing. It isn&rsquo;t established to keep anyone in or out, it&rsquo;s established to let someone know when a line has been crossed.</p><p> So back to our example: despicable co-worker (dog) crosses your values boundary and ZAP! You let them know:  That&rsquo;s not okay and don&rsquo;t include me.</p><p> People are pretty smart (some are even smarter than dogs) and it usually only takes one fence setting incident for them to realize that you&rsquo;re not going to join them in their dysfunction.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get us wrong&mdash;they won&rsquo;t like it. And if it&rsquo;s your boss, well that can be uncomfortable but well worth it.</p><p> I hope you don&rsquo;t have a boss like this, but setting a professional fence with her or him is often the most important fence to set. I&rsquo;ve set professional fences with a couple of my bosses and one in particular stands out. </p><p> I had assumed management of a new team and was also working for a new boss. His method of operation was to criticize staff, typically behind their backs. In spite of the fact that he was the boss, his insecurity drove him to diminish everyone around him in an attempt to make himself look better. Coming into my job, I didn&rsquo;t know this.</p><p> A few months into my new role I had a meeting with my boss and was discussing one of my staff and some things she was working on from a professional development perspective. Shortly thereafter I heard him criticizing her to another manager. He had twisted what I had discussed with him into something negative. I immediately asked him if his comments were related to the conversation we had earlier in the week. He indicated that they were, at which point I calmly explained to him (in front of the other manager) that he must have misunderstood me because his &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; of what I had said was incorrect. I then clarified the situation with a smile on my face and in a warm manner (even though I was seething inside).</p><h3> My boss got the message.  </h3><p> <br/> He was not pleased but began to understand that I wasn&rsquo;t going to play the game by his rules.</p><p> From that point forward I vowed never to share anything with him about my staff that he could twist and use against them. I essentially robbed him of the raw materials he needed to manufacture gossip in his factory.</p><p> Over time, others began to realize the same thing and set professional fences of their own. His flow of information shut down and his negative impact diminished.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve witnessed Danny set many professional fences. I consider him something of a Professional, Professional Fence Setter. To hear one of his stories, check out our video on setting professional fences. </p><p> If you have comments or questions we&rsquo;d love to hear from you!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-02 15:09:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-02 15:09:56.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_dhrGQFv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-set-professional-fences/\", \"post_id\": \"12937\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-02 15:09:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-02 15:09:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-set-professional-fences\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12936\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6274\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/how-set-professional-fences.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"653\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470236400,"author_id":197,"chart_url":""}

But there is one area of financial planning that has become so great a concern it has, literally, been labeled an American &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;: The Long-Term Care Crisis.</h3>While news outlets, government agencies, and researchers ponder how to change the course of this crisis, there is one fact advisors need to know: selling a life insurance policy can be a solution for many seniors who need to fund long-term care services and supports.But first, some background on the crisis:The PBS Newshour ran the sobering feature,Why Long-Term Care for U.S. Seniors is Headed for &lsquo;Crisis&rsquo;, reporting that 70 percent of Americans age 65 or older will need some form of long-term care for at least three years during their lifetime.<a href=\"http://isps.yale.edu/node/21469#.V5-v4IMrKM8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> A Yale University study</a>called the long-term care crisis the &ldquo;older brother&rdquo; of the health care crisis, presumably because they have the same parents &ndash; ignorance and inaction. The report, citing a major public research survey, found that &ldquo;two-thirds of Americans over 40 have done little or no planning for their care needs. Three-quarters think their spouse will care for them, and almost half think their children and grandchildren will care for them.&rdquo;A 2016 report by HealthView Services on the costs of long-term care estimated that a healthy couple aged 65 who retire today will need almost $300,000 to pay for their health care services, or more than half of their social benefits for the rest of their lives. The costs skyrocket when serious health conditions emerge.<a href=\"http://ltccommission.org/ltccommission/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Commission-on-Long-Term-Care-Final-Report-9-26-13.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> The US Long-Term Commission&rsquo;s 2013 report to the President and Congress</a>outlined the severity of the crisis and categorically listed some 28 recommendations, of which almost none have been addressed.Compounding this crisis is that long-term care insurance, which was popular among Baby Boomers just a few years ago, has largely gone away, with more than half the top insurers abandoning the market and raising premiums beyond the ability for policyholders to afford them. The high costs of health care delivery and the sustained low-interest rate environment have made it impossible for insurers to offer reasonably priced premiums.<h3> How will Seniors Pay for Long-Term Care?</h3>The need for costly long-term care services and supports can be unforeseen and immediate. For more than 75 percent of nursing home residents, entering the facility was relatively unexpected, with an injury or illness making it impractical to return home or care for themselves. And the first question they&rsquo;re asked when arriving at a facility is a big one: &ldquo;How do you plan to pay?&rdquo;The problem, of course, is that the majority of peoplehaven&rsquo;tplanned to pay. The vast majority of Americans have neither budgeted nor saved for their own long-term care. And while Medicare (and the alphabet of supplemental plans) can cover a significant chunk of a senior&rsquo;s health care costs, few realize that<strong> Medicare does not cover long-term care costs.</strong>Medicaid, however, does cover long-term care costs (but, importantly, not all). But, in order to receive Medicaid, the senior has to exhaust a significant amount of their financial resources&mdash;retirement savings, inherited property, money in the bank, etc.##TRENDING##Importantly, in all but a handful of states, in order to qualify for Medicaid applicants are forced to terminate their life insurance policies to access any significant amount of cash value those policies may have in order to spend that money down before they are eligible for Medicaid. Even if the policy has little or no cash value, it is either impractical or impossible for the senior (or their spouse or children) to maintain the policy.In other words, billions of dollars of life insurance are lapsed or surrendered by arcane Medicaid rules that force seniors to terminate their policies.<h3> Advisors and the Long-Term Care Crisis</h3>It is against this backdrop that financial advisors have to try to help seniors build a &ldquo;nest-egg on top of a nest-egg&rdquo; just so that long-term care needs can be met.This is where selling a life insurance policy for its fair market value can be a life saver for seniors and their families. Selling &ndash; rather than terminating &ndash; a policy and using the proceeds from the sale to pay for long-term care has numerous benefits.For one, having their own money means the senior can choose the level and type of care that best meets their needs. It may be most appropriate for the individual to receive care at an assisted living facility but, in most states, this isn&rsquo;t an option for recipients of Medicaid. It may also mean that an elderly parent doesn&rsquo;t have to move in with their adult children. It means, too, that they don&rsquo;t have to rush to sell off assets just to pay for long-term care.##PAGE_BREAK##<h3> Selling a Life Insurance Policy is a Valuable Option to the Long-Term Care Crisis</h3>The average offer price for the life insurance policy of a senior in need of long-term care will be approximately 25-40 percent of the death benefit. For an average sized policy of $100,000, this could mean receiving $25,000 to as much as $40,000, which can be used to provide home health care services or skilled nursing care for up to a year, or as much as six months of care in a nursing home. For larger policies, the value received will be even greater. (To learn more about the hidden treasure of a life policy, see<a href=\"/learn/investing-in-life/senior-clients-need-more-income-this-hidden-treasure-may-be-the-solution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Senior Clients Need More Income? This Hidden Treasure May Be the Solution.</a>)Having their own resources can mean the difference between a senior being admitted into the nursing home of their choosing versus having the county assign them to whatever bed is available in the region. Nursing homes and other long-term care providers welcome private resources to pay for care, even if those resources run out over time and are replaced with Medicaid funds.This idea of using a life insurance policy to address the long-term care crisis is gaining traction across the US. The federal Long-Term Care Commission recommended further study into &ldquo;the conversion of life insurance policies to long-term care benefit plans.&rdquo; The National Conference of Insurance Legislators recently renewed its model law on life insurance that requires mandatory disclosures by insurance companies to senior policyowners about &ldquo;the sale of the policy pursuant to a life settlement contract&rdquo; and &ldquo;the conversion of the policy in order to obtain long-term care health insurance coverage or a long-term care benefit plan,&rdquo; which is another form of a sale of a policy. Six states have adopted this or a similar law already.And now, as states are faced with the burden of burgeoning Medicaid budgets, new laws are being passed to require Medicaid agencies to tell applicants they can sell their life insurance policies and use the proceeds to fund their long-term care needs. Texas and Kentucky were the first states to pass such<a href=\"http://www.lifecarefunding.com/blog/medicaid-life-settlement-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Medicaid Life Settlement laws</a>.

{"original_id":6035,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Millennial Generation Has Killed Relationships","link":"the-millennial-generation-has-killed-relationships","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/torie_rich\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Torie Richardson </a> | torierichardson.com</p><h3> We are the instant gratification generation. And it has killed our romantic lives.</h3><p> <br/> Let me explain. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that, if you ask just about anyone in modern society, they&rsquo;d tell you that dating today is distinctly different than it was ten years ago. With the ever-growing popularity of technology, cell phones, digital culture and dating apps, dating seems to be nothing more than a casual, on-demand service we have at our fingertips.</p><p> As a millennial living and working in San Francisco, it&rsquo;s commonplace to see or hear people talk about their participation on apps like Tinder, The League, or Bumble, and nothing more than expected to hear about the casual hookups my friends are having. We live quickly and expect instant results; we are impatient and independent and go quickly after what we want - and, with that, what we want changes often.</p><p> The age of meeting someone in person, nervously calling them for the first time, courting them and spoiling them with genuine dates is dead. People meet online, they chat online, they become close online - you know everything about your date for the evening before you meet them because you&rsquo;ve been messaging on Tinder for a week.</p><p> And, even with that, it&rsquo;s expected that you message back in a timely manner - more than 24 hours and you lose their attention. The predominance of the internet has provided the capability to stalk someone&rsquo;s online presence and learn every minute detail about them without ever having to meet them in person. Technology has infiltrated our lives, our relationships, our ability to be romantic, our sex lives - all of it. Social media is king; when you match with someone on a dating app, it&rsquo;s completely normal to then try to find their Twitter or Instagram account to learn more about them before you dive into a conversation (or to decide if you even want to have a conversation). First dates become challenging to create conversation because you&rsquo;re no longer learning about each other - you&rsquo;re just awkwardly trying to take the relationship that exists online and manifest it in real life.</p><h3> This instant-dating lifestyle that lives at our fingertips leaves us constantly wanting instant gratification at all times romantically.</h3><p> <br/> Millennials shoot a text to their latest hook-up buddy and wait for a reply - no reply? They move on to someone else. The ability to reach out with no shame comes with ease for us, as texting does not require the confidence as asking someone out in person does. We get bored of our latest Bumble dates too quickly and move onto the next swipe. We&rsquo;re moving so quickly that we don&rsquo;t want to wait for the time it takes to build a real relationship with someone. It&rsquo;s not instant enough.</p><p> As a millennial living in the middle of this, it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve grown used to. Casual hookups are brought up regularly in conversations with friends and arguably almost every day I hear about something that happened in relation to a dating app. I personally don&rsquo;t care for dating apps much - I find the act of swiping entertaining, but have only ever met up with two people over the course of the past few years, nothing more - but it is challenging to find other ways to meet people, as everyone is so attached to their phone and the digital exploration of love. I question if, and when this fad will ever die - and hope that one day it will.</p><p> Though, keep in mind, this does not apply to every millennial out there - hell, one of my close friends is marrying her high school sweetheart in a month. And I have massive respect for those few that do find true love in modern society. It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p><p> As for now, friends, happy swiping!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-08-03 11:48:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-08-03 11:48:12.000000","image_url":"2016/8/article_placeholder_OUAOwog.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-millennial-generation-has-killed-relationships/\", \"post_id\": \"12943\", \"post_date\": \"2016-08-03 11:48:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-08-03 11:48:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-millennial-generation-has-killed-relationships\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"12942\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"6277\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/millennial-generation-has-killed-relationships.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1557\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1470308400,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}
