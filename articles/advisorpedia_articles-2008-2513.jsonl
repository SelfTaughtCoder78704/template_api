Making sure your website is secure is crucial to avoid hacking and therefore having to shut down your business for a few hours, or even days if you&rsquo;re very unlucky. Aside from only hackers, having a website that isn&rsquo;t secure can put you at risk of spammers. In other words, they may not be hacking your website to get confidential information, but they will fill your website with spam links, comments, and potentially even mess with your design if they&rsquo;re really advanced.</p><p> The thing to remember about security is that it&rsquo;s something that needs to be tweaked frequently. There are constantly new threats and strands of hackers popping up that have found their way around the old security systems, so updating is crucial. What many businesses forget is that updating software isn&rsquo;t your only form of defense. There are many ways to create layers of security, all of which deserve some attention.</p><h3> Top Things You Can Do to Help Improve the Security of Your Website</h3><p> <br/> Below are several different precautions you can take starting today to help protect your website from hackers and attackers:</p><h3> Update to the Newest WordPress</h3><p> <br/> For those who did not hear, just last week WordPress launched the new version of WordPress, version 4.2.4, which is considered a security release for all of the previous versions of WordPress. You can find the official announcement  <u>  <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> , where it discusses 6 different security issues the update will fix. In general, the fixes include:</p><li> Three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. This means that a hacker could change the code inside of your webpages with malicious JavaScript or malware downloads.</li><li> A potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site. This allows a hacker to change the information on the back-end of your website, which could include your content, user information, passwords, etc.</li><li> A potential timing-side channel attack. This refers to an attack that could occur at certain times during the day or as your website is working during a vulnerable state. <br/>  </li><p> This may not mean much to you if you&rsquo;re not a developer or overly familiar with different hacks, but those at WordPress actually discovered these vulnerabilities (and their names are mentioned in the article. You can update by visiting your Dashboard in the admin side of your WordPress and then finding the Update Now tab.</p><h3> Change to HTTPS</h3><p> <br/> Back in August of last year Google actually announced that websites who used HTTPS, or a secure website, would get a boost in rankings. In the past using the HTTPS was really only necessary for companies that housed confidential information (banks, lawyers, schools, etc.), but this quickly changed. It has now become a way to really keep all sites secure and not something that is optional for some sites (technically it is still optional, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be!). Google wanted to the web to be safer which is why they offered a boost in rankings for secure sites, so it&rsquo;s clear that this move makes a difference.</p><p> In short, if a website using HTTP it means that the data is not encrypted, meaning there is information being sent across the web in plain text. This makes the information much easier to find and read. If you have an HTTPS connected with your site, you&rsquo;re making it much more difficult for hackers to attack. You can learn how to change your site from HTTP to HTTPS  <u>  <a href=\"http://designmodo.com/wordpress-https/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u>  from DesignModo.</p><h3> Your Password Matters</h3><p> <br/> In addition, it&rsquo;s also worth mentioning the importance of secure passwords. Believe it or not, hackers do have a way of guessing your password, so if your password is full of random characters, letters, and numbers, it will take much longer to crack (and in many cases, it can&rsquo;t be cracked). Make sure WordPress thinks your password is strong. The best part about this is that it&rsquo;s so easy to make a change. Reset all of your passwords immediately!</p><h3> Limit Your Number of Login Attempts</h3><p> <br/> With WordPress particularly you can limit the number of failed login attempts from the same IP range. This means that if someone doesn&rsquo;t get your password right after three tries, they&rsquo;ll have to leave and go somewhere else before they can try again. Naturally, this makes it much more difficult to hack your site because they simply don&rsquo;t have enough time. It&rsquo;s true that hackers can use different IP addresses to get around this security block, but it&rsquo;s still better than nothing and will limit your risk to only the most advanced hackers. You can set this up by installing the  <u>  <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/login-lockdown/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Login Lockdown  </a> </u>  plugin.</p><h3> Think about Your Host</h3><p> <br/> Your website host could actually be a huge security issue, and according to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://torquemag.io/11-simple-tips-boost-wordpress-security/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Torque Mag  </a> </u>  article 41% of websites are hacked because of a vulnerability in their hosting service, making it the biggest security weak spot for websites. Look into the security that all of the different hosting options provide and make sure to choose the one with the best features. This may cost you more money, but it will be worth it in the end.</p><h3> Use a WordPress Security Plugin</h3><p> <br/> Chances are you have this already set to go, but this is also something that you need to update when an update becomes available. Again, there are new hacks out there everyday, so the updates protect you from the most recent (and then most common) attacks. Fortunately there are lots of WordPress plugins you can install to help keep you protected. You will find Firewall, Hardening, and Scanning and Tracking protection plugins, so it&rsquo;s best to get a plugin that focuses on all of these different types of protection. You can learn more about the right plugin for you  <u>  <a href=\"http://brandswithfansblog.fandommarketing.com/5-wordpress-security-tips-protect-site-hackers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .</p><p> In the end, security is all about staying up to date with the latest updates and always backing up your information in case something does happen. The tips above are some of the most important things you can do to stay secure that won&rsquo;t be difficult to implement, but of course there are more options that bigger sites should take into consideration.

{"original_id":2512,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Surprises of Divorce","link":"10-surprises-of-divorce","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Even if you had no experience with divorce prior to your own, you probably had some pretty clear ideas about what it would be like to go through one. You might have assumed it&rsquo;s always easier if you&rsquo;re the initiator, or that you&rsquo;d be so angry there wouldn&rsquo;t be time or space to feel hurt and lonely. When I&rsquo;m working with clients transitioning through divorce, we often spend a lot of time dealing with &ldquo;But I never thought&hellip;&rdquo; Which is why learning to let go of your expectations of what divorce is &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to be is one of the very first steps toward healing. In the meantime, though, I thought I&rsquo;d share some of my patients&rsquo; biggest divorce surprises in the hopes of making your journey just a little easier:</p><p> <strong>  1) &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize how many of my own values I had sacrificed during my marriage. </strong> We had different parenting styles and our values about family time, work/life balance, spending time with friends outside of the marriage were ultimately very different. I learned that I needed to find a way to use my voice and have a greater role in other relationships moving forward. &lsquo;Going along to get along&rsquo; is a disservice to both people. I had to ask myself, &lsquo;Why I was so quick no to say something or not share why certain things were so important to me? What was I afraid of?&rsquo; I know this kind of examination will help me going forward.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  2) &ldquo;I am more sad for my children than I am for myself. We no longer have an intact family. </strong> I realize I cannot fix that and that really bothers me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always been the &lsquo;fixer,&rsquo; believing that if I just worked hard enough, I could save my marriage and keep us together. I I know first-hand what it&rsquo;s like to have your parents divorce and so wanted to spare my children that pain. But at the same time, I know staying together for the kids is not the answer&mdash;especially when the marriage is beyond repair.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  3) &ldquo;My soon-to-be ex has come undone during the divorce, and it&rsquo;s difficult to watch at times. </strong> I&rsquo;m challenged by his behaviors and in some ways fearful about how this will play out as we co-parent. As long as I was at home taking care of our children, I was less aware of some of his more aberrant behaviors because I was the one in control and I knew I could pick up the slack. Now that he has the kids part-time, I worry I won&rsquo;t be able to protect them. I feel stuck in some of this fear like I cannot move forward with my own life. It&rsquo;s as if I now have a third child!&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  4) &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the significant impact my own upbringing had on my marriage, my decisions, and my values. </strong> I was surprised by this revelation. I used to ask, &lsquo;Why did I do that?&rsquo; But now things make more sense to me: Through therapy, I&rsquo;ve learned how to really examine how my childhood has affected my decisions and values as an adult. I am the middle child and, by and large, I have always been a people pleaser, often putting myself and my needs last on the list. But after awhile, resentment towards my spouse ensued. I became the doormat. Not any more!&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  5) &ldquo;Divorce is much harder than I had anticipated. </strong> I don&rsquo;t even know what that means, only that it feels much harder. I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the roller coaster of emotions&mdash;the constant ups and downs and re-examination of issues I thought I&rsquo;d addressed and left behind. And since I was the one who initiated the divorce, I thought the process would be less difficult. But I really struggled when my ex started dating again. I honestly thought I wouldn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  6) &ldquo;I have always been really independent, and I thought I could get through this all on my own. </strong>  However, I found myself relying more on my family and friends than I had anticipated. I am glad I did that. I am much more grateful for them than I was in the past.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  7) &ldquo;I had many more lonely nights than I thought I would have.  </strong> I thought the feelings of freedom would be there right from the start.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  8) &ldquo;I felt like a failure for a very long time. </strong> There are no divorces in my family, so my failed marriage only seemed magnified. The holidays were particularly hard. I was the one that had to juggle schedules while I co-parented with my ex-husband. The constant &lsquo;let me check my schedule&rsquo; made me feel like the odd man out.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  9) &ldquo;I thought because I initiated the divorce, I would be able to move on faster. </strong> That didn&rsquo;t happen! I&rsquo;d gone through a lot before I even told my husband so I figured the rest would be easier. Yes, I was further along than my husband but because the divorce dragged on for quite a bit of time, the initial euphoria of making such a huge decision wore off.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  10) &ldquo;I had this idea that after several months, I would be over it and would had moved on. </strong> It&rsquo;s not that easy. Some days I feel like I am in same place. When I was going through my divorce, I felt like I should be on some sort of schedule. I am not sure where I got this notion from, but believing this got me caught in a negative mindset. As time went on, I found it easier to be critical of myself for not being further along the process. Only after therapy, talking with others, and giving myself more time to heal, have I learned that there is no specific time frame for recovering from divorce. Everyone has their own journey and allowing ourselves to heal is part of that process&mdash;no matter how long it takes.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-24 19:43:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-24 19:43:31.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_DSsCUzP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-surprises-of-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"5655\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-24 19:43:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-24 19:43:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-surprises-of-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5654\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2570\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/87604643-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"863\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440507600,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2511,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Who They Think You Are?","link":"are-you-who-they-think-you-are","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Have you ever met someone who was totally different than you thought they&rsquo;d be?  </strong> Maybe you&rsquo;d known them in a past-life, like back in high school, many, many moons ago.  Maybe you&rsquo;d known them in a different context, like you had worked together and now you&rsquo;re seeing them socially for the first time.  Maybe you just followed them on social media and had never really met for real.  But somehow, before you really got to know this person, you had a picture in your mind of who you thought they were and what they were like, and when you actually spend time with them, the two realities don&rsquo;t jive.   Ever happen to you before?</p><p> It happened to me recently and it was very&hellip;disturbing.  It made me question my own instincts about people as the person-I-got-to-know and the person-I thought-that-was were so drastically different that it was a very jarring experience.  And that got me thinking about how others might experience me.  Do they ever think of me one way or assume that I&rsquo;m a certain way and then find themselves totally shocked when they meet the real-in-the-flesh-Kimberly?  Am I the person they thought I&rsquo;d be?</p><p> Because we make assumptions about people.  We decide about them.  Maybe we&rsquo;re more wrong than we realize.</p><p> Recently, I met a friend for lunch and she had been chatting with a gentleman next to her and had shared with him that I lived in Pelham.  When I showed up, he said knowingly, &ldquo;Pelham.  I knew a guy from Pelham.  He&rsquo;s not around anymore &ndash; he passed away.  But Pelham&hellip;you&rsquo;re one of those kind of people.&rdquo;  I was a little confused, to be honest.  What did he think Pelham was like?  What did he assume I was like?  He&rsquo;s assuming that I&rsquo;m like some dead-guy I&rsquo;ve never met because I live in the same town?</p><h3> But that&rsquo;s what we do, we make assumptions.</h3><p> <br/> My recent experience with the person-I thought-that-was-one-way but turned out to be quite another has really made me think.  How can we avoid deciding about people?  Not assuming anything one way or the other?  I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s possible or if we&rsquo;re just wired to do this and can&rsquo;t avoid it, but I want to bring more mindfulness to it.</p><p> And, like in everything, there are some things that we can&rsquo;t control and some things we can.  I can control how congruent I am with my actions that lead others to decide about me.  Because if people are going to make assumptions about me, I want to give them as much evidence to go on as I can, to help them to see what is real.  I don&rsquo;t want to  <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/blog/2015/02/05/people-know-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   profess one thing and show up as someone totally different  </u>  . </a>   I don&rsquo;t want to teach one thing and do the opposite.  I don&rsquo;t want to expect something from others that I&rsquo;m not willing to do myself.  I want to bring mindfulness that my actions are in alignment with my words, with the quotes and quips and blogs that I put out in social media, and with the choices I make.</p><h3> Knowing full well that assumptions will be made.</h3><p> <br/> Now of course from an authentic leadership perspective, this disconnect can be devastating.  Trust, your ability to connect, and have a meaningful impact, all go down the tubes when people are holding you at arm&rsquo;s length.  Nobody wants to follow too closely or give their best to someone whose person and agenda are questionable.</p><p> I think this mindfulness begins with us.  Are you mindful about mixed messages you may be sending?  Are you who you show you are?  Where are the incongruencies?  I guess we don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s worth thinking about.</p><p> Because I know one thing for sure, I don&rsquo;t want people to be disappointed when they meet the real me.

{"original_id":2510,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"20 Ways To Reduce Stress & Anxiety","link":"20-ways-to-reduce-stress-anxiety","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whether you know it or not, the fight or flight reaction controls much of your behavior and reactions. Yes, the same fight or flight reaction that makes your heart beat fast when you see the flashing lights of a police car in your rearview mirror and the same reaction that caused your prehistoric relatives to deal with the threat of a saber-toothed tiger. And it is what is behind much of what you think of anxiety, stress, and even depression.</p><p> Since this reaction comes fast and furiously, you must keep your mind and body in peak shape so that it does not negatively affect you.</p><p> Here are twenty ways you can make sure stress and anxiety don&rsquo;t get the best of you.</p><p> <strong>  1. Take a walk outside </strong></p><p> Enjoy the sunshine! Studies show that Vitamin D &amp; sunshine can boost your mood &amp; help kick the blues away. Nature has a way of reaffirming your faith in life and connection with the world.</p><p> <strong>  2. Keep a daily magic journal </strong></p><p> Make special note of daily coincidences and write them down. Become aware of events happening around you that you may not have noticed because of life distractions &ndash; sounds of nature, people/signs/architecture on your way to work, special features of your local environment. Write these things down every day and they will begin to appear like magic.</p><p> <strong>  3. Breathe </strong></p><p> Every single relaxation technique through the centuries has recommended this. It seems so obvious but when stress and anxiety strike, our breath becomes shallower. Slow deep belly breaths can stimulate the full body&rsquo;s relaxation response.</p><p> <strong>  4. Get moving </strong></p><p> Exercise causes the body to release naturally endorphins, which helps to remove tension &amp; heal your body. It also causes an increase of blood flow to vital organs and the brain. This helps loosen your muscles and clear from the system the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol.</p><p> <strong>  5. Drink more water </strong></p><p> Staying hydrated is important, especially since we are made up of 60% water. Even 2% dehydration can have symptoms similar to anxiety.</p><p> <strong>  6. Avoid foods high in animal fats and sugar </strong></p><p> When our brain detects danger or threat, it causes the fight or flight reaction which shows itself as stress, anxiety, or depression. In order to feed this response, our brain causes us to crave fat and sugar to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; us from danger. What they do is keep the fight or flight going and therefore the stress, anxiety, and depression.</p><p> <strong>  7. Try supplements </strong></p><p> B-complex, a prescription strength B vitamin called Deplin, DHA fish oil, GABA, Magnesium, 5-HTP, L-Theanine, Passion Flower, and Valerian root. In addition, organic teas can be very helpful. Green tea leaves contain Theanine a naturally occurring substance that decreases anxiety. Teas with chamomile and lemon grass can be very relaxing especially before bed.</p><p> <strong>  8. Increase your appetite for self-help materials </strong></p><p> Spend time watching, listening to and/or reading self-help books, podcasts, programs, CDs, webinars. Look for material that focuses on realistic, practical action.</p><p> <strong>  9. Find support </strong></p><p> Look for a friend or head to my website or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fb.com/CoachMD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.fb.com/CoachMD  </a> </u>  Facebook page to have a place to share your true feelings, find support, and get daily inspiration, guidance, and motivation.</p><p> <strong>  10. Listen to music </strong></p><p> Focus on music that makes you smile or makes you want to dance. Avoid songs that cause you to reminisce.</p><p> <strong>  11. Use affirmations </strong></p><p> Feeling stress, anxiety, or depression is the result of your brain perceiving that you are in danger. If you affirm, over and over, &ldquo;There is no danger, there is no threat, I am safe&rdquo; this will help calm this. Another one that I find very effective is &ldquo;I will always find a way, and a way will always find me.&rdquo; Repeating these throughout the day will be very helpful.</p><p> <strong>  12. Meditate </strong></p><p> Any type of meditation, practiced daily for 5 &ndash; 20 minutes once or twice a day is the most effective anxiety reducer I know. One of my favorite quotes is &ldquo;Prayer is when we talk to God; meditation is when God talks to us.&rdquo; There are many different styles of mediation and there is not one better than another. For help getting started, I have several videos on my website,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.charlesglassmanmd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.CharlesGlassmanMD.com  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  13. Visualize </strong></p><p> Quite often, when we awaken in the morning, there is a small window of time before our pesky brain reminds us of the dangers of the day that await us. The above affirmations are perfect to use upon awakening, but even more valuable at this time is to visualize. Since states of anxiety, stress, or depression may have become commonplace for you, it is time to picture in your mind a state of peace and ability to manage your daily challenges. I outline many methods in my books and programs, but what the methods have in common is trying to help you re-train your brain to make calm energy be your norm and common place reaction, rather than anxiety and stress.</p><p> <strong>  14. Smile and laugh </strong></p><p> It is very difficult to feel down when you are smiling. The very act releases natural anti-depressants. Look into the mirror and make goofy faces that make you laugh at yourself. While driving in the car smile, even if you don&rsquo;t feel like it. Tune into comedy on the radio or television.</p><p> <strong>  15. Stand up straight </strong></p><p> The fight or flight response, and therefore anxiety, stress, and depression tighten all your muscles in order to spring you into action to fight or flee. But generally, you are not going to fight or flee so all this reaction does is make you slump over. Improving your posture will help send relaxation signals to your brain. Place your back up against the wall and have the back of your head, shoulders, and heels touch.</p><p> <strong>  16. Don&rsquo;t watch the news </strong></p><p> The old adage, misery deserves company comes into play here. Many times when we feel stressed, down, or anxious we turn to places where others are experiencing it also and maybe worse than us. All this does is diminish your faith and weakens your ability to manage and relieve stress, anxiety, and depression.</p><p> <strong>  17. Try alternative medical approaches </strong></p><p> Chiropractic, Rolfing, Massage, Acupuncture, Feldenkrais all can be helpful. I have tried each and weekly go for chiropractic adjustments.</p><p> <strong>  18. Try activities that nurture your mind and body </strong></p><p> Yoga, Tai Chi, Pilates, other Martial Arts as Kung Fu/Karate/Tae Kwon Do can be enormously rewarding and provide tools for you to focus and manage stress.</p><p> <strong>  19. Take action and stay organized </strong></p><p> Identify one action step you need to take each day and do it. Multitasking can be a distraction from taking meaningful action. Focus on one action at a time and move on to the next only when you complete the current one. Keeping a to-do  list with boxes can be very handy and as you check the boxes, the sense of achievement will feel very good. Don&rsquo;t procrastinate. Procrastination is a short-term gain that leads to long-term pain.</p><p> <strong>  20. Understand anxiety, stress, and depression </strong></p><p> You must never feel as though something is wrong with you, that you are weak, that you are losing your mind. These reactions always mean that your brain detects danger and is therefore reacting as it is programmed to do &ndash; fight or flee the danger. These are human responses, but you do not have to believe, trust, or take direction from them. As you practice these steps, the physical symptoms will become less believable and therefore less debilitating.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-24 19:31:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-24 19:31:12.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_RIsbtpe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/20-ways-to-reduce-stress-anxiety/\", \"post_id\": \"5651\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-24 19:31:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-24 19:31:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"20-ways-to-reduce-stress-anxiety\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5650\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2568\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Zen.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"615\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440530100,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

Unfortunately, qualifying for these benefits is extremely difficult and the approval process is quite complicated and often requires the assistance of an attorney who specializes in social security disability claims. <br/> <br/> If you are considering applying for disability benefits you should not approach this task in a haphazard fashion.  There is actually a 5 step approval process that social security follows. It is a sequential process that is dependent on completing each step in order.  Knowing how to maneuver through this process will greatly increase your chances of getting approved. <br/> <br/> Step #1: Determining if you are working at Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA). If you are not currently working you can move to step #2. If you are working and earn more than $1090 (in 2015) then you will not qualify for disability benefits. <br/> <br/> Step #2: Do you have a medical condition that is severe or a combination of conditions that are severe? Social security will determine your condition or combination of conditions to be severe if \"they significantly limit your ability to do basic work activities\". You will need to gather all your medical records and submit them to social security so they can make their determination. <br/> <br/> Step #3: Determining whether your medical condition, or combination of conditions, \"meets or medically equals\" the criteria of an impairment. Social security has a list of impairments that they call \"the listings\". If you can prove that you have one of the medical conditions at the level described in the listings then you will be deemed to be disabled. If not, you will have to move to step #4. <br/> <br/> Step #4: Determining your \"residual functional capacity (RFC)\" and whether you have the RFC to do your \"past relevant work\". Basically, social security must figure out your ability to do physical and mental work activities on a sustained basis.  If you are found capable of returning to past relevant work you will be denied and not found to be disabled. Otherwise you will proceed to the final step. <br/> <br/> Step #5:  Determining if you can do any other work, considering your RFC, age, education and work experience. If social security finds that you cannot do any other work, and your condition is expected to last 12 months or more, then you will qualify for benefits. <br/> <br/> To be certain, especially given the history of fraudulent cases in the system, qualifying for social security disability benefits is an extremely difficult and arduous process. Most claims are declined on the first application and the approval process can literally take years. <br/> <br/> It is often beneficial, if not necessary, to seek the assistance of an attorney who specializes in social security disability claims.  Hiring an experienced attorney who understands the system and can fully and properly prepare your application may be an investment worth making. <br/> <br/> Social security disability benefits can be an invaluable benefit for those in need and, in some cases, provides the necessary lifeline to keep the disabled from becoming impoverished.  These benefits were put in place to help those in need but, like most governmental programs, it remains your responsibility to make sure you don't become a victim of the bureaucracy when you would otherwise qualify for benefits.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-24 19:25:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-24 19:25:08.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_JF24OEI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-qualify-for-social-security-disability/\", \"post_id\": \"5649\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-24 19:25:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-24 19:25:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-qualify-for-social-security-disability\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5648\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2567\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ssd-package.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"839\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440525600,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2508,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Simple Formula for Distraction Subtraction","link":"a-simple-formula-for-distraction-subtraction","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Sharply focused teams tend to deliver results effectively. Those who take on too many things tend to melt down. Sounds simple, but in this distracted world, it's an issue in most organizations. </p><p> Is everyone on  <strong>  your </strong>  team aware of your short list of key priorities? If I asked them, could they rattle  them off? Are you actively monitoring for distractions and filtering them out? </p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re running a Fortune 500 corporation, a pre-IPO start up, or a government agency, the simple formula of  <strong>  choose, transmit, and filter </strong>  can make the difference between success and failure. In fact, many leaders who under-deliver on their goals or fail in their roles, do one or two of these things well, but not all three. </p><h3> Fixing Failure to  <strong>  Choose </strong></h3><p> Here&rsquo;s what I hear when I interview the leader&rsquo;s colleagues:  &ldquo;She says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; too often, and we end up having 10 big priorities &ndash; that&rsquo;s too many, and we lose focus.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;He changes priorities too frequently. If it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;shiny object,&rdquo; then he wants to try it, and we&rsquo;re left saying &lsquo;What just happened?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> Fix it: To deliver most effectively you first need to narrow down the universe of the &ldquo;important&rdquo; to a small number of key priorities that: a) are within your / your group&rsquo;s capabilities, b) will directly propel your organization or initiative to its overall desired goals within a set time frame, and c) will address and remove key obstacles along the way. These priorities need to be likely to remain as important a year from now as they are today, and highly correlated to your organizational strategy. </p><h3> Fixing Failure to  <strong>  Transmit </strong>  Your Priorities </h3><p> Sounds like:  &ldquo;He has a good idea of what he wants &ndash; or we think he does &ndash; but he&rsquo;s very guarded about them, so we&rsquo;re not at all sure where we&rsquo;re heading and why.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s got priorities, but I&rsquo;m not totally sure what they are&mdash;she needs to let everyone know what they are, so we&rsquo;re all on the same page.&rdquo;</p><p> Fix it: To deliver most effectively once you have your handful of priorities, you now need to &ldquo;transmit&rdquo; them over and over -- and over again -- to all involved. Stay on message with them by returning to them in your future communication, social media, and other forums. Priorities are useless if they&rsquo;re clear in your mind but aren&rsquo;t drilled into the minds of the entire organization. Make your priorities their mantras. </p><h3> Fixing Failure to  <strong>  Filter </strong></h3><p> Sounds like:  &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an idea truck &ndash; every month she&rsquo;ll dump off (or she&rsquo;ll get from HQ) the next batch of big ideas, and we end up changing tactics and strategies too often.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;He needs to hold the line on our priorities when the board is asking questions about alternatives. Just because they ask a question or challenge a strategy doesn&rsquo;t mean he should go change it.&rdquo;</p><p> Fix it: Potential distractions to your key priorities are always trying to clot the arteries of your enterprise&mdash;it&rsquo;s human (and organizational) nature. It&rsquo;s critical that you actively monitor for them and filter them out. If the latest great idea or important initiative is not directly related to delivering one of your key priorities then it&rsquo;s your time to shine with a creative &ldquo;no thank you.&rdquo; </p><p> Filtering out potential and actual distractions before they impact the people doing your work&mdash;having the &ldquo;managerial courage&rdquo; to say no to colleagues, higher-ups, or your board, whom you&rsquo;re more inclined to please than disappoint&mdash;means you need to be creative to make sure they can absorb and agree to a &ldquo;no.&rdquo; </p><p> To that end, and to say no effectively, you need to be careful. Remember that it&rsquo;s the task at hand AND the long term relationship with the person you&rsquo;ve got to turn down. Provide them with plenty of context and rationale for the denial. </p><p> Sometimes a flat out high-context &ldquo;no&rdquo; is the right thing, particularly when you think they&rsquo;ll absorb it well. In other cases&mdash;as in dealing with a more autocratic board or CEO, it often needs to be a &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s a great idea, and we have to find the right time for it &ndash; if we don&rsquo;t want to interfere with the results we&rsquo;ve shared with the marketplace, then it should be a next-year thing,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;yes, and here&rsquo;s what would happen to our results if we did that,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;yes, and here&rsquo;s what would be needed for that to happen.&rdquo; </p><p> Keep your own (and your team&rsquo;s) focus as clear as a bell: Choose, transmit and filter your way to achieve results, and your team will be more likely than not to stay on track and execute effectively.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-24 19:17:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-24 19:17:39.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_oElJUJ6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-simple-formula-for-distraction-subtraction/\", \"post_id\": \"5647\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-24 19:17:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-24 19:17:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-simple-formula-for-distraction-subtraction\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5646\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2566\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1abb8b0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"968\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440503100,"author_id":131,"chart_url":""}

Go ahead, take out a piece of paper and write them down. Come back when you're done.</p><p> So, what did you write? Are they three things other financial advisors would not write, or that other advisors could not claim?</p><p> Probably not, and don't take offense. For most of our careers, we have been trained and encouraged to use the same clich&eacute;d terms. This part is hard. I have worked with hundreds of advisors, and reviewed hundreds of advisor websites, and practically all of them say essentially the same thing. Many say EXACTLY the same thing! Here is a list of things that will not differentiate you:</p><li> Trust</li><li> Experience</li><li> Good customer service</li><li> Financial planning</li><li> Retirement planning</li><li> Individualized recommendations <br/>  </li><p> Even people who speak and consult in our field frequently get it wrong. At FPA Denver 2010,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.haydenwealth.com/ecard.cfm?ID=239070\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vern Hayden  </a> </u> , in his talk \"Differentiate Or Die\" gave a partial list of potential differentiators. But, these, too, will not differentiate you:</p><li> Fee-only</li><li> Objectivity</li><li> Being a CFP <br/>  </li><p> Some of these are \"table stakes.\" Things that must be true, or that you at least must claim, to earn the right to talk to a potential client at all. Some of these may be strengths; an aspect of your practice that will increase client satisfaction but not necessarily separate you from many other advisors.</p><p> And let's get this out of the way right now &ndash; I know, everybody says it but you actually do it. Got it. I know you are vastly better at whatever it is than the half-million other advisors in the country. Even so, here is the hard truth: when everyone else says the same thing, how is a prospective client to know?</p><p> Here is a simple test to help determine whether what you are saying will differentiate you. Ask \"could an advisor say the opposite and still be credible?\" For example, if you say one of your top three reasons is because you provide great customer service, could an advisor say to a client \"I do not provide great customer service\" and still be in business? Probably not. On the other hand, if one of your top three reasons people in your <strong>   target market </strong>  should come to you (assuming for the moment your target market is obstetricians) is \"I know the particulars of planning and risk management for obstetricians,\" could an advisor say to a potential client \"I do not know the particulars of planning and risk management for obstetricians?\" Assuming the advisor is not targeting obstetricians, sure.  In fact, most should say it, because that is a legitimate specialty.</p><p> This is not a perfect test, but it is one way to evaluate whether what you claim has the potential to separate you from the competition.</p><p> Your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.advisorchecklist.com/strategic-differentiation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   differentiator  </a> </u> , your niche, your unique value proposition, may be the hardest marketing question to answer. But answer it you must, or your business development and referral programs will never come close to their potential.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-24 19:02:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-24 19:02:42.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_L2wLQ1t.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-top-three-reasons-clients-choose-you/\", \"post_id\": \"5643\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-24 19:02:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-24 19:02:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-top-three-reasons-clients-choose-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5642\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2564\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/timthumb-15_5.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1747\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440502200,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}

Here&rsquo;s the rub: most of them are just slick, paid-for back up for the conclusions the issuer wants you to reach. It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the words on the page presenting fact after fact, sounding oh so logical and real.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how it works: Company A, selling product B, goes to a writer and says, &ldquo;Create a white paper that backs up these conclusions.&rdquo; The writer (in search of a living after all) takes the job and begins data mining for information that supports the conclusion. I am quite sure Stephen Covey didn&rsquo;t have this in mind when he extolled the virtues of &ldquo;begin with the end in mind.&rdquo;</p><p> There are examples galore of white papers created to convince you to act on specific strategies that of course are neatly achieved by the purchase of their products and services: buy this newsletter; purchase this investment; call our brokers and get in now!</p><p> Economic data, IRS Private Letter Rulings (which are not authoritative rulings but situation specific rulings for issues raised by taxpayers) and any other dubious source data are used to raise your level of anxiety and fear. The goal? To convince you to act&mdash;and act right now. After all, it&rsquo;s in the new white paper&hellip;</p><p> The white paper craze is a carefully designed new mode of advertising wrapped neatly within something that looks objective, important, informative and authoritative. Instead, they are designed to present carefully culled data to force you to a predetermined conclusion that favors the seller&rsquo;s goals. Which are clearly not to enlighten, educate or inform.</p><p> The next time you receive this seemingly irresistible opportunity to obtain the &ldquo;free white paper &rdquo; that promises to divulge the industry&rsquo;s latest and greatest thinking, consider who is sending it and why. Ask yourself:</p><li> What is their agenda?</li><li> What are they selling?</li><li> With whom are they affiliated?</li><li> What buying habits or experiences have directed this offer to your inbox?</li><li> What is the &ldquo;call to action&rdquo; created by the &ldquo;research&rdquo;? <br/>  </li><p> The whole white paper concept appeals to the intellectual and emotional part of us that believes we are being offered a peek into new research and information. But in reality, we are being sucked down the marketing rabbit hole of preconceived conclusions and carefully assembled supportive data or faux-search.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a difference between real, objective and thoroughly researched reports and the slick self-promoting productions so commonly ground out through financial institutions. They look real and meaningful, yet they are nothing more than the &ldquo;infomercial&rdquo; brought to you by Wall Street&rsquo;s marketing machine.</p><p> Reader/buyer beware of the less than objective (or even deceptive) work that leads you by the nose to agree with their foregone conclusions. At least they should re-label their work to gray papers or better yet, the &ldquo;Just Because It&rsquo;s Written Doesn&rsquo;t Make It So&rdquo; Report.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-24 18:57:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-24 18:57:39.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_tqfP8h0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/youve-got-those-white-paper-blues/\", \"post_id\": \"5641\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-24 18:57:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-24 18:57:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"youve-got-those-white-paper-blues\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5640\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2563\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/full-inbox.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"661\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440518400,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2504,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Keep A Steady Hand On The Tiller","link":"keep-a-steady-hand-on-the-tiller","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I hope this finds everyone still enjoying a nice end to the summer and, importantly, avoiding the day-to-day in the financial press.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve happened to look, however, you will have seen and heard quite a few headlines from last week that might raise concerns. The following are some examples:</p><p> &ldquo;If your pension, retirement savings or 401k is invested in the stock market, you lost big today&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;The stock market plunges and drops 530 points and more than 1000 points for the week&rdquo;</p><p> First, remember that the financial media thrives by writing colorful headlines, which draw eyeballs and hence sell advertising.</p><p> It has been a crazy few weeks for investors though.</p><p> China&rsquo;s stock market &ndash; after one of the biggest run-ups in history &ndash; has dropped approximately 40% in just a few weeks. Greece is still in the news with the talk of new elections, and oil and other commodities are also down sharply.</p><p> What should an investor do?</p><p> Well, the best advice might have come from my 10 year old son, Jack, when last Friday night (the day of the 530 point drop in the stock market) he was telling me about his day on the water in sailing class. He said, &ldquo;Daddy, today the wind was strong and it was a little scary at first. I remembered what my teachers said though, kept calm and just stayed on course.&rdquo;</p><p> Staying composed when storm clouds bring bad weather is not easy but, just as keeping a steady hand on the tiller and staying calm is the key to reaching a port safely, avoiding the urge to make changes in volatile markets is the key to long-term investing success.</p><p> Over the years, I&rsquo;ve written many commentary pieces after market falls (it seems that concerns over 50 year floods come every 5 years or so in the stock market) and my message is always the same.</p><p> Make sure you have a solid long-term plan (emphasis on long-term) that is prudently diversified and designed to meet your goals, not the investment models of others.</p><p> I know it is hard to avoid getting emotionally drawn in by market headlines but try to remember that investing should be a means to an end, not a competition.</p><p> Try to stay anchored on your plan versus getting caught up in the day-to-day.</p><p> This is very difficult, by the way, and many investors make poor decisions at the wrong time.</p><p> Earlier this year, Morningstar published a report that looked at the difference between the average return of mutual funds and the actual returns of investors. According to their research, the 10 year return of the average U.S. equity fund for the period ending 12/31/13 was 8.18%. What was the average return of U.S equity fund investors over this same time period? Unfortunately, only 6.52% (click  <u>  <a href=\"http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=637022\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u>  for the full report and see the below chart).</p><p> <a href=\"https://blog.wealthfront.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/morningstar.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"morningstar\" src=\"https://blog.wealthfront.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/morningstar.png\"/> </a></p><p> As John Rekenthaler from Morningstar wrote, &ldquo;Investors tend to get in and out of an asset class at the wrong time.&rdquo;</p><p> If you believe that this 10 year period was an outlier, you can look at research from the institutional investment consultant DALBAR. The findings showed that investors have underpeformed the market by approximately 4.2% per year over the past 20 years (click the following, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dalbar.com/Portals/dalbar/cache/News/PressReleases/2014QAIBHighlightsPR.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bad Decisions Persist After Decades of Education and Disclosures  </a> </u> &rdquo; to read the full whitepaper).</p><p> What can we do to be better investors?</p><p> If you do not already have a written Investment Policy Statement (IPS) or long-term plan, consider getting one.</p><p> At Fiduciary Wealth Partners (FWP), we work with clients to help set long-term investment goals, and establish risk, liquidity and asset allocation targets designed to meet these objectives before we invest. It has been our experience that, if you write down goals before investing, it is easier to stick to a plan versus letting emotion, or the competition of the market, take over.</p><p> FWP believes that an IPS should set long-term targets for various asset classes and maximum and minimum risk control ranges around the targets. This way, regardless of the emotion of the market, you can keep yourself from making big bets that can turn into big mistakes.</p><p> As an example, a moderately risk-adverse investor might consider having a long-term target of 60% in equities with a low end range of 50% and a high end range of 70%. If the market drops significantly and the equity allocation goes below the minimum range, the IPS mandates that an investor buy. On the other hand, if the market has run up significantly, the maximum IPS ceiling forces selling to take some chips off the table. We recommend reviewing allocations and rebalancing back to long-term targets quarterly.</p><p> I certainly do not know how this current market will unfold over the next few weeks or months, but sticking to a disciplined plan is the key to investment success. The old saying is, &ldquo;Strategies don&rsquo;t blow up, people do.&rdquo;</p><p> Beyond the Morningstar or DALBAR research mentioned above, one of the best examples of potentially lost opportunities might be from the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In March 2009 the S&amp;P 500 hit the &ldquo;world is going to end&rdquo; level of 666. If you had an IPS in place, and someone to help you stick to your written plan (it is hard to keep emotions in check on your own), you would have found yourself below your minimum allocation target to equities and would then have bought equities at the end of the quarter to rebalance back to your long-term target.</p><p> Even after what the financial press is currently calling &ldquo;a rout&rdquo;, the S&amp;P 500 closed yesterday at 1,970.  A gain of over 195% over from the 666 low in 2009.</p><p> To help &ldquo;keep calm and carry on&rdquo;, below are a few simple recommendations to consider.</p><p> <strong>  Have A Long-Term Plan That Is Designed to Meet Your Individual Goals </strong> <br/> - Investing should not be a competition <br/> - Unless your goals have changed, do not throw out a good plan with a bad market</p><p> <strong>  Set Investment Policy Max. and Min.

With a cost of over $68 billion, Sandy caused organizations to face the question of whether they are truly prepared to recover quickly and continue operating after a disaster. Here are nine important takeaways. <strong>  1. Consider an off-site, real-time mirrored failover location on a separate power grid </strong> , so that you can continue operations in the event of a power outage or natural disaster localized to your immediate area <strong>  2. Assign back-up roles </strong> in case key players are unavailable or missing. <strong>  3. Plan for all possible communication issues </strong> , including use of satellite phones, hotlines and Web alerts. <strong>  4. Establish accessible spending accounts for employees </strong> , make standing lodging arrangements near your recovery site and account for other logistics, like mail delivery and payroll. <strong>  5. Plan for extended recoveries </strong> , in case business is displaced longer than expected. <strong>  6. Keep your organization&rsquo;s documentation </strong> , scripts and business continuity planning handbook up to date. <strong>  7. Provide an alternative method of accessing your data and documents. </strong> <strong>  8. Be sure all vendor contracts are complete and up to date </strong> , including those with providers of media storage, insurance and fuel. <strong>  9.

What&rsquo;s the one thing we should do to get started?&rdquo;</p><p> I must admit I&rsquo;m sometimes torn for an answer to this one. There is a very strong case for having a video on your homepage - often called an explainer video - which encapsulates in no more than about two minutes who you are, what you do and why the viewer should get in touch or at least explore your website further.</p><p> You might choose to do this using motion graphics; alternatively you may prefer the CEO to present to camera or be interviewed; or you could opt for a combination of the two. Whichever route you go down, a homepage video - done well - will create an excellent first impression and help to drive traffic to your website.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2TqcCG1H1ZA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-23-at-11.11.51-AM-2.png\" width=\"849\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> That said, there is another type of video that every firm should have.. a testimonial video. It&rsquo;s all about what we marketers call  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-social-proof\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social proof  </a> </u> . In essence, there&rsquo;s general consensus among psychologists that when faced with uncertainty, human beings attach particular significance to what other people are saying and doing. But not just any old people; those we really take notice of are people like us. Without wanting to over-complicate matters, this bias towards our social peers is what some psychologists refer to as  <u>  <a href=\"http://new.dixie.edu/humanities/File/Implicit%20Egotism.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   implicit egotism  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Social proof and implicit egotism are both influential on buying decisions.</h3><p> <br/> So, if you&rsquo;re selling a product or service as most firms do, it&rsquo;s vital to give prominence on your website and in your marketing materials to happy customers.</p><p> But that means more than simply having a list of testimonials.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22869334\" target=\"_blank\">   Research  </a> </u>  has shown that the most effective reviews or recommendations are those that include a photograph. People like to put a face to the name.</p><p> However there&rsquo;s no more effective form of social proof - at least online - than a video testimonial. The combination of seeing and hearing one of their peers explain why they used your company can have a very powerful impact on your prospective clients. Again, shorter is generally better; aim for no more than two minutes.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-23-at-11.16.49-AM-2.png\" width=\"850\"/></p><p> click to view</p><h3> Think about who your target clients are.</h3><p> <br/> Which of them fit that profile best? Which of them would be willing to wax lyrical about what you&rsquo;ve done for them? And who would come across best on camera?</p><p> You can either fit two or three testimonials in the same video or - better still - have a series of short videos, each featuring a different client.</p><p> A final point:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.spring.org.uk/2012/01/why-stories-sell-transportation-leads-to-persuasion.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Studies  </a> </u>  also show that people respond far better to stories than they do to facts and figures. So, ask the client providing a testimonial to tell the story of how you helped them; what they were looking for - or what their problem was - before they discovered you; what you did for them; and, most importantly, how it&rsquo;s made them feel.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Zap4qiZkoys\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-23-at-11.18.51-AM-2.png\" width=\"852\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> Again, as with explainer videos, testimonials  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/blog/does-quality-of-video-really-matter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   must be done well  </a> </u> .

I now realize what a profound gift that is&mdash;to have both the time and the motivation to say what is most important.</p><p> We shared lots of memories those last few days. First up? The day he was determined to teach me to ride my bike without the training wheels. I was scared and kept delaying the inevitable. That day he just took them off, promising me he&rsquo;d hold on while I rode down the incline that was our driveway.</p><p> I was doing just fine until I realized he&rsquo;d let go and boom! There went my confidence and off I flew into the giant pricker bush at the edge of the lawn. Took hours to get all of them out&mdash;it looked like I&rsquo;d been attacked by a pack of badgers.</p><p> But the very next day, my dad insisted I get back on the bike and do it again. I was very careful to avoid that damned bush&hellip;</p><p> He had tried college, but it didn&rsquo;t take. Bored and restless, off he went to join the Army. I came along during his stint in France and my parents used their base in La Rochelle to travel around Europe. This was heady stuff for a small town Connecticut boy and it left him with permanent wanderlust.</p><p> He would take us on all sorts of adventures when we were growing up. We didn&rsquo;t have much money, but he&rsquo;d toss us in the back of the Buick and off we&rsquo;d go. To the shore for the day. The mountains for a weekend. And Vermont. Always Vermont. Because no matter how much adventuring he did, that man loved to walk (and drive) the hills and countryside of his first and forever home.</p><p> While the other neighborhood dads drove station wagons, mine got a motorcycle. He had a sense of adventure that always astonished and delighted my friends.</p><p> Later, when he met my stepmother, they rode their bikes across the U.S. and Canada on their vacations and long weekends. That&rsquo;s when they weren&rsquo;t in Vermont skiing or golfing.</p><p> My dad was always in motion&mdash;my pals christened him &ldquo;the energizer bunny&rdquo;. Always up for a party, a 200 mile round-trip drive for the best sausage he&rsquo;d ever tasted (and was craving that day) or a jaunt to the pick-your-own roadside stand to make his legendary blackberry pie.</p><p> Even after his treatment robbed him of his sense of taste and he could barely walk, he insisted we all pile into the car to his newly-discovered BBQ Exchange to sample their pulled pork and six barbeque sauces (50 miles round-trip). His last meals weren&rsquo;t hospital food, but hand-delivered plates of his favorite fried chicken and spaghetti with meatballs. His beloved wife Judy and BFF Kathy made sure of it.</p><h3> My dad lived every minute of his life to the fullest, exactly the way he wanted to.</h3><p> <br/> And really, that&rsquo;s the best epitaph of all.</p><p> Thank you Popster. For showing me the way and having the most elegant and true-colored exit one could hope for.</p><p> There will be no other posts this week or next. Just a heartfelt thank you for reading this and indulging me.

This method is therefore based upon a Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method (CDCVM) rather than no verification.  This is the reason you can have high value payments with CDCVM but are limited to low value when you lack this device authentication.</p><p> All of this comes into the open just as Samsung ramps up its entry into the wallet war market, and Samsung have one big advantage over Apple, according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3998736/samsung-apple-pay-mobile-payment/\" target=\"_blank\">   Time Magazine  </a> </u> :</p><p> &ldquo;In addition to near-field communication (NFC) connectivity, Samsung&rsquo;s new devices employ a technology called &lsquo;Magnetic Secure Transmission&rsquo;, which allows its mobile payment system to be used on standard credit card machines. Apple Pay only uses NFC connectivity, which is far from ubiquitous in the checkout lane ... All you have to do is swipe up on the screen, select a card, and input your PIN or fingerprint to authenticate. Then wave the phone over the credit-card reader and be on your way.&rdquo;</p><p> That&rsquo;s not only incredibly friendly, but also capable of being used as a CDCVM checkout.</p><p> Then there&rsquo;s Android Pay, the Google upgrade to Google Wallet to compete with Apple and Samsung.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/google-android-pay-vs-apple-pay-1295416\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Some claim  </a> </u>  Android Pay has advantages over Apple and Samsung by being integrated with loyalty programs, such as MyCokeRewards; it&rsquo;s contactless payment system doesn&rsquo;t require a fingerprint or other authentication (although that defeats the high value payment option); and Android phones are far more plentiful in choice from the Samsung  Galaxy S4 to the HTC One M7 to the LG G2 to the original Moto X and Nexus 5.</p><p> All in all, it&rsquo;s getting really interesting so thanks to CNN for this  <u>  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/infographic/technology/mobile-payment-comparison/\" target=\"_blank\">   infographic  </a> </u> , which also includes PayPal and Bitcoin to see the range of options now available (doubleclick image to enlarge).</p><br /><p> It really is a mobile wallet world (at last).</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-22 19:18:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-22 19:18:16.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_k8vBa7G.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/mobile-wallet-wars-apple-pay-vs-samsung-pay-vs-android-pay/\", \"post_id\": \"5628\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-22 19:18:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-22 19:18:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"mobile-wallet-wars-apple-pay-vs-samsung-pay-vs-android-pay\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5627\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2558\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-22-at-12.25.11-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1976\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440424800,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2499,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Role of the African American Advisor","link":"the-role-of-the-african-american-advisor","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I have been reflecting on the plight of African American wealth and wondering whether or not an African-American financial advisor as part of the solution. Yes I am an African-American financial advisor so I may be biased. I have found that no matter the race of my client, by finding a shared experience I am able to explain complex financial concepts as well is calm their fears regarding their financial life.</p><h3> African-American financial advisors role in the racial retirement crisis</h3><p> <br/> National Institute on Retirement Security (NIRS) published Race and Retirement Insecurity in the United States in 2013 highlighting racial disparities in retirement readiness. I wrote a blog on my sister site entitled  <a href=\"http://401kadvisor.us/african-american-retirement-divided-we-fall/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   African American retirement divided we fall.   </u> </a> I believe that I have unique insights into this plight. None of my blood family had any specific education in retirement planning. They were not blessed with a transfer of wealth from their parents. In fact they were happy to have survived Jim Crow.</p><p> Fortunately my parents were blessed to both have pensions from the firms they work from along with Social Security. Some of their family members were not so blessed and never received a Social Security check for the years they had worked. Many Black people are aware of the higher mortality rates for Blacks in figure why should I save. If I make it that long I&rsquo;ll collect Social Security. This is further cemented in their minds is we&rsquo;ve seen so many high profile cases of violence against black men.</p><p> That being said, all of our futures are uncertain. My dad made it to 83; his brother to 90. The majority of their family died in their 50s or younger. For that reason it&rsquo;s wise to believe there&rsquo;s a chance you will live to see a day where you won&rsquo;t be working. Depending upon your level of wealth you may call that financial freedom or retirement. Most African-American financial advisors I talk to, have similar life stories to mine. I believe this is an asset when counseling African-American clients and prospects.</p><h3> African-American financial advisors shared experiences</h3><p> <br/> Many Black people have had a bad experience with the financial services industry or are aware of the bad experience of others. Many have been unable to get loans or found themselves paying higher interest rates based on their color. While they may have been able to navigate these issues, they have often been targets of some type of financial scam. Predatory lending is a term often associated with communities of color. One study cited in the report noted that fewer than one in four African Americans who were in the top quartile of black wealth holders in 1984, remained there in 2004. The report also cited a study that found that black business owners received bank loans with less frequency, of smaller size and at higher interest rates than white-owned companies.  1</p><p> It&rsquo;s not surprising then that according to research by Prudential 2  and ING 3 , Blacks tend to be more conservative investors than whites. Even wealthy African-Americans are much more conservative with their savings than whites with similar finances. A study done by Credit Suisse in conjunction with the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University, found that the wealthiest 5 percent of African Americans&mdash;those with a net worth of $357,000 or better&ndash;pour a greater share of their holdings into relatively low-risk, low-reward investment vehicles, such as certificates of deposit, saving bonds, and insurance policies, rather than stocks, bonds and mutual funds, investing more of their money in cash and savings bonds. 4</p><p> It&rsquo;s hard to trust something you don&rsquo;t understand. A survey noted a major barrier to maximizing defined contribution participation is the lack of education about how these plans work. My experience with an African-American woman that works for a nationally known hospital illustrates. For about a decade she had invested her 401(k) money in a money market. She trusted my counsel to invest in a balanced stock and bond portfolio. On a separate occasion I discovered she didn&rsquo;t even know what a stock or bond was. How do we ask people to trust and investing their hard-earned money if they don&rsquo;t understand the building blocks of 401(k) investments?</p><p> Many African-American youth look to sports and entertainment as a way to become wealthy. Unfortunately high income does not always translate into wealth. Many who&rsquo;ve achieved great incomes have lost them because they had no education on evaluating the risks of their spending or investments. It inflames me every time I hear of another story of an athlete who has been taken advantage of by a financial professional. Many of the people came recommended by someone who might&rsquo;ve been well-meaning, but was incapable of properly vetting their expertise and if they were  <u>  <a href=\"http://envisionwealth.us/wealth-advisor-trustworthy-fiduciary/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   worthy of trust  </a> </u> .</p><p> I believe an African-American advisor can understand the pressures that many of these young people are under and trying to help their families get out of &ldquo;the hood&rdquo;. Many of gone without their whole lives and overspend this newfound income at the expense of their future. What about their friends were not so lucky to be physically gifted. If their high school, church or college didn&rsquo;t teach them, where will they learn? Who will teach?</p><p> I&rsquo;m proud to say that I am a member of the Association of African-American Financial Advisors. Currently few in number, I hope to see the numbers of African-American financial advisors grow. In 2000 while pursuing my MBA at MIT I was asked why there weren&rsquo;t more black students pursuing careers in Finance. My answer was that there simply was a lack of exposure.</p><h3> Finding the right African-American financial advisors education</h3><p> <br/> Like advice to the masses, the advice and education must be unbiased and independent of products being purchased. All African American advisors are not independent. Many sell one thing- life insurance. While an important part of a well-rounded financial plan, it is not everything. Certain financial professionals like a CERTIFIED FINANACIAL PLANNER&trade; professional or an investment advisor representative are obligated to work in their client&rsquo;s sole interest. A CFP&reg; has passed a completed coursework in the areas of insurance (risk management), retirement planning, tax planning, investment planning and estate planning. Their skills have been validated by passing a grueling two day comprehensive exam.</p><p> If you&rsquo;d like to know more or work on an education program to reverse the results.

Most owners reach a point where they cannot move the business forward because they simply don't know what to do.  And so the business stagnates.  In a recent survey, 41 percent of owners (over two-thirds of whom were age 50 or older) stated that a barrier to their exit was \"too much dependence on my active involvement.\" <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/grow-value-and-exit-successfully-owners-need-change-their-role#Reference1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  1 </a>   Our experience tells us that a high proportion of the owners who did not see their companies' dependence on them as an issue would hear a very different opinion from professional buyers.</p><p> Often then, the necessary first step to move a business beyond stagnation is to help owners understand that the major obstacle to growing value in most businesses is the owner.  Until owners realize that they must change in order for the business to prosper, they will ignore our efforts to help them move their businesses forward.  </p><p> The change owners must make, as we explained in the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/catch-22-changing-business-owners-role\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   previous article  </a> </u> , is to transition owners from being the center of all decision-making and activity in the business--or hub of the wheel--to an important, but less critical, spoke.</p><p> This transition is not easy, but with knowledge of Exit Planning you are able to:</p><li> Understand how and why owners need to change if they are to meet their financial and other exit goals.</li><li> Can educate owners on how changing their role benefits them, their companies and their employees.</li><li> Provide access to the advisors who can undertake value-building tasks.</li><li> Know how to quarterback an owner's advisor team to keep everyone accountable and working in an owner's interest. <br/>  </li><p> These abilities allow attorneys, CPAs, bankers, financial professionals and other professional advisors to provide guidance other like professionals lack.  We gain these abilities through our experiences working with owners in a consultative capacity and through learning more about how Exit-Planning-trained advisors work with owners.</p><h3> Your Role in Changing an Owner's Role</h3><p> <br/> If we are to help our owner-clients create transferable businesses through changing their role in their companies (from indispensable to dispensable), we too must change our roles (from more than \"just\" CPAs, financial advisors, attorneys, M&amp;A intermediaries, etc.).  As important and vital as our professional skills are to a successful owner transition, we must develop our abilities that are beyond the confines of our professions.</p><p> For example, we must develop the ability to foster in owners four specific attitudes and provide them with supporting resources.  These attitudes include:</p><p> <strong>  1.  A willingness to delegate meaningful duties to top management. </strong>  This requires owners to surrender, or at least share with key employees, control of many facets of their business operation.</p><p> As key employees broaden their capabilities and take ownership of their jobs, their growing competence and expertise is a platform for accelerated company growth and increasing business value.</p><p> Further, as key employees assume greater responsibility, authority for and competence in various company functions, so do the junior workers under them.  For many owners, finding and encouraging skilled management within the company to move the business beyond the owner's capabilities and giving them the authority to do so is the key to rapidly creating business value.</p><p> <strong>  2.  A willingness to involve outside advisors to help improve business operations, procedures, process, and planning. </strong>  This requires owners to accept outside advice and implement.  For Peter Drucker, this was a key point in an entrepreneur's success,</p><p> ...the founder does need people with whom he can discuss basic decisions and to whom he listens.  Such people are rarely to be found within the enterprise.  Somebody has to challenge the founders' appraisal of the needs of the venture, and of his own personal strengths.  Someone who is not a part of the problem has to ask questions, to review decisions, and above all, to push constantly to have the long-term survival needs of the new venture satisfied by building in the market focus, supplying financial foresight and creating a functioning top management team.  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/grow-value-and-exit-successfully-owners-need-change-their-role#Reference2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2 </a></p><p> <strong>  3.  Openness to an objective assessment of the capabilities of the existing management team to take the business to the next level. </strong>  In many companies, the management team rises through the ranks and there is a high degree of loyalty between owner and management.  This loyalty blinds owners to the need to objectively assess management performance on an ongoing basis, and to insist upon best-in-class performance.  Outside advisors can be an objective resource in determining if an owner has a capable management team to move the company forward to the extent necessary to achieve the owner's exit goals.</p><p> Consultant (and BEI Member) Ken Stiefler describes how he worked with one of his Exit Planning clients, \"This owner brought me in when he recognized two things about himself:  </p><li> too much of the business revolved around him, and</li><li> he wasn't capable of taking the business to the next level.  In an effort to change his role, the owner began planning to replace himself by bringing in a new general manager (instead of simply delegating to existing management), by creating a plan to delegate his responsibilities, over time, to others in the company and by looking at outsourcing some tasks.\"  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/grow-value-and-exit-successfully-owners-need-change-their-role#Reference3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  3 </a> <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  4.  An ability to constantly focus on strengthening value drivers executed through others--management team members and outside advisors. </strong> To owners who believe they are too busy working in their businesses to work onthem, you can suggest that changing their attitudes, delegating more responsibility to best-in-class management (developed internally or recruited) and using specialized advisors to supply knowledge and ability where lacking in the business, will free up time to spend it on activities they choose.</p><h3> We hope that this article persuades you that:</h3><li> Owners need help in understanding the importance of changing their roles if they are to help, not impede, business growth.</li><li> You can recommend to owners specific actions, and support them as they take those actions.</li><li> The tools necessary to help owners \"step up and step aside\" are outside the technical expertise of most professional disciplines.  This means, you too must step up and expand your role, thus differentiating yourself from others in your profession.</li><br/>References1Bruce, Doug and Wong, Queenie, Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Passing on the Business to the Next Generation, November 2012.<br/>2Drucker, Peter F., The Essential Drucker, HarperCollins, 2001, pp. 159-160.<br/>​3As part of his role as an Exit Planner, Ken recruited a management consultant who assessed the current management team and concluded that new management was necessary if business was to grow at the pace desired by this owner.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-22 18:32:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-22 18:32:31.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_0ALxNgk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/to-grow-value-and-exit-successfully-owners-need-to-change-their-role/\", \"post_id\": \"5624\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-22 18:32:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-22 18:32:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"to-grow-value-and-exit-successfully-owners-need-to-change-their-role\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5623\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2556\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-22-at-11.44.04-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"420\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440421200,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

Was also interested in people that were using Social not just for Demand Generation but through the whole of the sales process. Jaz made contact with me and said he was using Social for pipeline creation / Demand Generation, but also to nurture leads through the pipeline.</p><p> During this blog I explain how Jaz is using Social, but we also cover the ROI, what has worked, what hasn&rsquo;t worked for him. The blog ends with his &ldquo;must have tool&rdquo; recommendation.</p><h3> Jaz&rsquo;s Background and Company</h3><p> <br/> It is one of those twists of fate, you start with a clear business plan, only to be successful at something at a complete tangent. Jaz started his own company  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.makeadifference.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.makeadifference.org.uk  </a> </u>  in 1998, the objective was to help people get back into work and to helping small businesses be successful. After all, people who run businesses get bogged down in &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;.</p><p> To promote this new venture, Jaz turned to Social Media. What happened, was that people started coming to him saying; &ldquo;You you seem to be good at Social, can you teach us?&rdquo; If you check out his website  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.makeadifference.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.makeadifference.org.uk  </a> </u>  you will see that his company&rsquo;s mission now is to &ldquo;Bring the benefits of Social Media to Your Business!&rdquo; Jaz spends most of his time helping small business scale their own Social programs.</p><p> Jaz told me &ldquo;we were so successful in our Social Media work to promote our company that people turned to us and asked us to do the same for them&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Now we are pretty much focused on helping people with their Social Media.&rdquo;</p><h3> Why Social Media works for Small Business</h3><p> <br/> One of the &ldquo;objections&rdquo; I often get is that Social Selling is that it&rsquo;s for big companies. Jaz&rsquo;s target market is for Sole Trader and Small Business and he points out that (we talk ROI in a bit) that Social Media is zero cost. It only costs the time you invest. It also allows you to network online which means that companies with the small business can &ldquo;punch above their weight&rdquo; in terms of Marketing Budget.</p><p> (More on online Networking also in a moment).</p><h3> Using Google+ and Twitter to create Leads</h3><p> <br/> With all of the recent press that &ldquo;Google+ was dead&rdquo; I asked Jaz why that and not Facebook?</p><p> Jaz said &ldquo;The objective of every business is to create leads. Inbound enquiries if possible. That means that every person and every business should have a Google Plus site. Why? Because it enhances SEO (Search Engine Optimization).&rdquo; &ldquo;Plus with the aggregated benefits of Twitter (Tweets being indexed) and use of Periscope. This all adds to your &ldquo;Google Juice&rdquo;. And Jaz continued &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget this is all at zero cost, apart from your time.&rdquo;</p><h3> The Google+ Return on Investment (ROI)</h3><p> <br/> Jaz is emphatic about the SEO enhancement that Google+ can give. I&rsquo;ve certainly seen my SEO rankings through continued investment in Google+. Jaz explained one of his clients provides Excel training services and when he came on one of Jaz&rsquo;s training courses he was ranked on page 26. Over a ten week period, posting 2 or 3 times a day, he was able to uplift that to Page 1.</p><p> I asked Jaz if there was any &ldquo;secret sauce here&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just push any material out, this has to be high quality sharing&rdquo;, he then explained, &ldquo;Google&rsquo;s algorithm is looking for engagement, just firing stuff though Buffer, just doesn&rsquo;t cut it.&rdquo;</p><h3> The Twitter ROI</h3><p> <br/> If you are a regular reader you will have seen my article:  <u>  Using Twitter to get C-Level Appointments: A Case Study </u> . Jaz has a 72 year old client who was spending around &pound;20K per annum on advertising and getting a few hundred pounds worth of income. When he started to use Twitter via Jaz&rsquo;s workshops for no expenditure on advertising apart from his time, he got over &pound;2000 of Business in 2 weeks via Twitter and averages &pound;500 a month via Twitter.</p><h3> What can Jaz Teach us about using Social to Sell?</h3><p> <br/> Jaz recommends you &ldquo;know your target markets, listen, engage and interact with them. When you build trust with people, they will also open their networks to you.&rdquo; Jaz then said what all successful sales people say which is &ldquo;be proactive&rdquo;. He also said, &ldquo;Often on Social people forget to ask for the sale&rdquo;. He was keen to say that you don&rsquo;t have to be aggressive and asking for the business should just &ldquo;flow&rdquo;.</p><h3> Is there a Programmatic Approach?</h3><p> <br/> Jaz also uses different Social platforms through the Sales cycle. &ldquo;Twitter is for connecting, look for the signals, then switch to DM (Direct mail), email or telephone&rdquo;. This drives people to his workshops, he uses his workshops to upsell 1-to-1 sessions, building trust as he goes.</p><p> Once the person is connected, he links to them on Linkedin to stay in touch and nurture. You also get access to their networks. LinkedIn provides Jaz with referrals sales, which is becoming more and more the way he gets business.</p><h3> Use &ldquo;Tweet Hours&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Jaz fills 80% of his training courses from partaking in &ldquo;Tweet Hours&rdquo;. Not to be confused with the American Twitter chats. There are 400 Tweet Hours taking place each week in the UK. This is a time to pitch to 1.8 Million people and 500 businesses. &ldquo;Often&rdquo;, Jaz said &ldquo;There are businesses with 9 of the 10 jigsaw pieces and they just need yours to make their proposition viable&rdquo;.</p><h3> What Didn&rsquo;t Work?</h3><p> <br/> Jaz did an experiment with Linkedin over a 10 week period. Just sticking to the home feed, he didn&rsquo;t take part in any groups, he found that he needed an average of 400 actions including likes, shares, comments and new connections to attract an average 24 profile visits on a weekly basis. This is a lot of action for a small return. In 10 weeks out of over 250 profile visits Jaz notices that only 1% actually came via Linkedin Search, all the other views were via his activity.</p><p> Jaz&rsquo;s view on LinkedIn is; &ldquo;LinkedIn is about trust, people search for you (like a phone directory) to see that you exist. It isn&rsquo;t somewhere I would see as a way to proactively drive leads.&rdquo;</p><p> I certainly agree that LinkedIn is people&rsquo;s shop window, but do know B2B sales people that do drive business via LinkedIn. But certainly understand where Jaz is coming from for his market. As is often the case with Social, there is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo;.</p><h3> Any Tool recommendations?</h3><p> <br/> Jaz is a Nimble CRM user and recommends you use it before networking to &ldquo;look somebody up&rdquo;. Often he has done this as an event via the mobile version. He also uses the Social and Email capability to track and nurture people. What are my contacts talking about? When was the last time we connected? Etc.</p><p> If you want to make contact with Jaz his details are as follows:</p><li> Website: <u>  <a href=\"http://www.makeadifference.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.makeadifference.org.uk  </a> </u></li><li> Twitter:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jazgreer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @jazgreer  </a> </u></li>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-22 18:20:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-22 18:20:52.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_CqEitE9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/case-study-the-secret-of-social-media-success-for-small-businesses/\", \"post_id\": \"5622\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-22 18:20:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-22 18:20:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"case-study-the-secret-of-social-media-success-for-small-businesses\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5621\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2555\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-22-at-11.16.47-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"511\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440436500,"author_id":482,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2495,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Your Practice Needs 2 Marketing Strategies","link":"why-your-practice-needs-2-marketing-strategies","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;How much would you spend to get a new client onboard?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> While the answer will vary for everyone of course, the typical answer I hear from advisers is &ldquo;it depends, but maybe a couple of hundred dollars&rdquo;</p><p> Generally professionals recognise the potential lifetime value of a client and are prepared to invest to acquire more valuable clients. The ROI makes sense: spend a couple of hundred dollars perhaps and turn that into several thousand dollars over coming years.  It is a good investment&hellip;.IF you actually get the thousands of dollars  in years to come.  So we have to have a marketing strategy for that.</p><p> Typically advisers seem to be willing to invest about 3-5% of the anticipated value in acquiring a particular client at any given time,which is consistent with the commitment that good practices make in allocating around 3-5% of revenue to &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; each year.  A common problem with this approach though is that this budget usually includes the allocation to existing client &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; as well as new client acquisition.  It follows that it is fairly common for existing clients to actually have less time and attention and resources invested in them as the budget allocation gets weighted towards acquisition rather than retention.</p><h3> Major mistake.</h3><p> <br/> The full potential lifetime value of clients will only be realised if the professional relationship exceeds their expectations and they are convinced that they are receiving extremely good value.</p><p> We need a marketing strategy for this too then.</p><p> <img alt=\"satisfaction-12-728\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/satisfaction-12-728.jpg?w=610&amp;h=458\"/></p><p> <strong>  The potential lifetime value of these clients is the sum of: </strong></p><li>  anticipated revenue from ongoing advice, plus,</li><li>  new advice and planning requirements that will arise with changing circumstances, plus,</li><li>  the acquisition costs saved from referrals generated by these clients, times</li><li>  the positive brand promotion and goodwill generated with recommendations and positive word-of-mouth, times</li><li>  the duration of the relationship &ndash; which is directly linked to client satisfaction level. <br/>  </li><p> Try putting some numbers around that formula&hellip;.even with some conservative assumptions regarding future opportunities, brand promotion value, and potential referral generation that might be achieved it becomes obvious fairly quickly that in terms of getting a decent return on marketing spending a practice will often do far better from investing more in creating loyal existing clients than in competing in the open market to attract the attention and interest of potential clients.  Factor in the potential change in how long a very satisfied client may stay and pay, as opposed to an ambivalent client, and the numbers increase exponentially.</p><h3> To realise this potential we need a clear strategy.</h3><p> <br/> It is also important to direct efforts to the acquisition of new clients of course.  Every year we will lose some clients through natural attrition &ndash; and perhaps that has nothing to do with our service offering or client experience.  People get divorced, move overseas, start and shut down businesses&hellip;there are a myriad of reasons why good clients leave that actually have nothing to do with how well we do our work, and those clients need replacing if a practice is to grow.  Some of those new clients can be generated via our existing and extremely satisfied clients if we get the service and marketing to them right, and some will come from new sources.</p><h3> To realise this potential we need a clear strategy as well.</h3><p> <br/> The point is that for our allocation of budgets and resources it makes sense to have 2 areas where we commit resources rather than a catch-all &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; budget.  We should have a budget and clear strategy for creating new client opportunities, and it is a smart play to link that strategy to the existing client relationships and marketing plan.  One feeds the other if done well; the two are linked, though quite separate in focus and execution.</p><p> <strong>  Arguably we should allocate a higher proportion to &ldquo;client marketing&rdquo;.  This is different to &ldquo;servicing&rdquo;&hellip;.as we need to &ldquo;market ourselves&rdquo; to existing clients if we are to create maximum lifetime value for the practice.  The difference between the two is philosophical as much as anything else: </strong></p><h3> a. Service is simply about meeting expectations and creating a sense of satisfaction. <br/>  </h3><h3> b. Marketing is about winning support and changing behaviour.</h3><p> <br/> Client marketing includes the obvious such as ensuring they are aware of the full range of expertise and services we can provide, together with our desire to work with others just like them, and ensuring that everything we do for our clients professionally is wrapped in quality.  It also includes the less obvious such as investing in ways of deepening the relationship and increasing trust levels, and finding ways to positively delight clients, and looking for ways to create or add value to their lives in areas beyond just our professional expertise.</p><p> So rather than a service strategy of simply trying to keep customers happy enough to continue with us, we need to have a second marketing strategy whereby we are continually trying to win more support from them and actively change their behaviour from quietly happy customers to active and willing brand ambassadors on our behalf.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-22 16:13:32.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-22 16:13:32.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_AF8Quen.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-your-practice-needs-2-marketing-strategies/\", \"post_id\": \"5618\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-22 16:13:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-22 16:13:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-your-practice-needs-2-marketing-strategies\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5617\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2553\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1440130266107-787dd24d69d7-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"500\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440414000,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

Numerous factors come into play for selecting the preferred provider. </p><h3> How Decisions Are Made:</h3><h3> <br/> Listening to understand</h3><p> Recognizing that the customer perspective comes first, ask why you were invited in for the consultation.

While it may seem repetitive if you already had this conversation, it reconfirms the idea in their mind plus new events may have arisen since you last spoke.</p><h3> Intelligent questions asked</h3><p> Differentiating yourself from most others begins with careful listening to be able to ask strategic questions.  These may include how the one problem is affecting other situations with performance, their clientele satisfaction, as well as office morale.</p><p> The bigger the picture you are able to get your prospective client to reveal, the larger the potential sale and greater the opportunity to become the chosen supplier.</p><h3> Equal exchange of conversation</h3><p> Match the level of animation in the conversation to make the other party feel comfortable with you.

With understanding of the entire picture, you are able to make assurances for what you are able to provide.</p><p> But the true differentiator is having built a trusting relationship. The new ideas that will provide a more robust solution within their budget is what most decision-makers seek.  But the remaining question becomes whether your service is affordable and if the timeline is right.</p><h3> Seeking middle-ground</h3><p> Budget is to be asked at the beginning of the conversation.  By the time it gets to the end of the meeting, you have a great idea of all costs involved.  It is your duty to ask for prioritization of everything suggested and for full disclosure of monies available to spend.</p><h3> Earning the sale</h3><p> Conducting business in this manner will increase the opportunities provided.

They don&rsquo;t see the business advantage and human value of being compassionate.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Leading+with+compassion+brings+out+the+best+in+others.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/08/17/is-compassion-part-of-your-leadership-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leading with compassion brings out the best in others.  </a> </u></p><p> Do you bring compassion into your leadership? Here are some ways to cultivate a compassionate leadership strategy: </p><h3> Define Compassion</h3><p> <br/> Since compassion means many different things to each of us, we need to know our specific definition.</p><li> Separate compassion from &ldquo;giving in&rdquo;</li><li> Look at compassion as a key leadership action rather than as a weakness</li><li> Reflect how compassion has added to your job growth</li><li> Write out some words that describe compassion for you <br/>  </li><h3> Identify Ways To Show Compassion</h3><p> <br/> Think back to a time when someone showed you compassion. Were you struggling with a project and a co-worker stepped in to help you out? Did you need some time out of the office and your boss supported a day off? Was another department up against a deadline so you offered to roll up your sleeves and help out?</p><p> All of these scenarios can help us recognize situations where we can lead with compassion. When we realize how compassion has made a difference in our lives, we are empowered to use it to make a difference in someone else&rsquo;s life.</p><h3> Teach Compassion</h3><p> <br/> Knowing the impact of compassion, leaders owe it to their teams and colleagues to share its value. When people show us compassion, we can point out our gratitude and willingness to pay it forward. We can also add a segment on compassionate leadership to a leadership development program. Compassion needs to be a skill taught to everyone in an organization. When we demonstrate compassion, we build a culture of trust.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=When+leaders+demonstrate+compassion%2C+they+build+trust.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/08/17/is-compassion-part-of-your-leadership-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   When leaders demonstrate compassion, they build trust.  </u> </a></p><h3> Reward Compassion</h3><p> <br/> Just as we recognize other leadership performance, we can reward our team members and leaders with &ldquo;Excellence in Compassion&rdquo;. Send out an email with the story of how an individual displayed extraordinary compassion in a particularly difficult situation. These anecdotes become part of a company&rsquo;s brand and perpetuate the value of compassion.</p><h3> Build Relationships Through Compassion</h3><p> <br/> A wonderful benefit of showing compassion is growing stronger relationships. The manager in my original example knew that she needed to be more compassionate with her team to help them feel part of something bigger than themselves. Instead of looking at the team members as selfish, she decided to adjust her thinking and be more understanding of their challenges and frustrations. In that way, she became more human too.</p><p> How do you bring compassion to your leadership strategy?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-21 18:03:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-21 18:03:27.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_XJVCGoU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-compassion-part-of-your-leadership-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"5612\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-21 18:03:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-21 18:03:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-compassion-part-of-your-leadership-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5611\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2550\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-21-at-11.03.43-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"581\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440432000,"author_id":476,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2490,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Helping Poor","link":"helping-poor","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Helping people work their way out of poverty isn't just about money. It requires addressing the beliefs and culture around money that may be keeping people stuck both financially and emotionally.</p><p> Like many of my financial planning colleagues, I have an interest in finding effective ways to help middle- and low-income people increase their financial health. One method I've used from time to time is teaching community classes.</p><p> I've offered classes on basic financial skills like managing money or the fundamentals of investing. I've also tried offering classes focused on money scripts or other aspects of money psychology. Guess which classes fill and which ones don't?  </p><p> No matter what their income level, people tend to shy away from looking at the relationship between money and emotions. There seems to be a widespread money script of, \"More financial knowledge is all I need in order to have more money.\" Yet I've seen time and time again over the years that this simply is not true.</p><p> Helping low-income people increase their financial literacy is a start, but it isn't enough. This was confirmed for me recently, at the annual Financial Therapy Association meeting, when I heard a talk by Louis Barajas, CFP&reg;. A noted <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/My-Street-Money-Street-Level-Managing/dp/098304600X/ref=la_B001HMNANE_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436975249&amp;sr=1-7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  author </a> and expert on giving financial advice to the poor, he said,</p><h3> \"All the financial literacy in the world is not going to help the poor.\"</h3><p> <br/> Born into a poor family in East Los Angeles, Louis managed to become the first Hispanic CFP&reg; in the US and pull himself out of poverty. After a successful career, he returned to the barrio to live his passion of helping his community transcend poverty. It turned out to be far more challenging than he ever dreamed.</p><p> As Louis said in his talk, he discovered that, \"Most people in poverty are unaware that their cultural beliefs hold them back.\" He described some of those beliefs, which I would call money scripts. A few of them are:</p><li> <strong>  A sense of fatalism, that \"this is just how things will be.\" </strong></li><li> <strong>  An assumption that working for someone else is the only option. </strong></li><li> <strong>  A group dynamic where anyone who reaches for too much success is pulled back down into the community's financial comfort zone. </strong></li><li> <strong>  A victim mentality of blaming and feeling powerless to change. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Relying for financial advice on the wealthiest or most successful person in the neighborhood, without the knowledge to evaluate the validity of that advice. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Barajas has found that telling someone about a better way doesn&rsquo;t work. He had to find a way to experientially expose them to it. As he said, \"If you don&rsquo;t see a brighter future, you won&rsquo;t plan.\" But even before that, people need help to take care of their urgent needs first before they can even consider that a future exists.</p><p> Hearing Barajas's talk only confirmed for me how important it is to consider people's beliefs and emotions about money. This is essential knowledge for financial advisors, debt counselors, social workers, volunteers, and anyone working to help people get out of poverty. More money or more knowledge about money is simply not enough to help people who seem stuck in poverty or in a repeated pattern of financial missteps.</p><p> The easiest way to advise people who are struggling financially is to focus on the mechanics of managing money. Yet anyone who really wants to help people make lasting changes in their money behavior needs to find ways to help them look deeper. Ironically, the need to look beyond the money in order to build financial health is one important thing the poor and the wealthy have in common.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-21 17:13:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-21 17:13:48.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_V7P4zjv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/helping-poor/\", \"post_id\": \"5608\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-21 17:13:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-21 17:13:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"helping-poor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5607\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2548\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-21-at-10.20.11-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"723\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440435600,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

They have a CRM solution they wanted to me to market to my list of subscribers. After the initial conversation, next steps were outlined and they sent me more in-depth info on their product to evaluate.</p><p> After exploring their solution, I decided they weren&rsquo;t a good match for my vertical. So before we went through all the trouble of sending even more information or sitting through a demo, I emailed them and declined. The email I got back was brilliant. They thanked me for my time and then simply said:</p><h3> <strong>  &ldquo;We always like to lose early.&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> Now that&rsquo;s a response from a company who understands the value of disqualifying. Unfortunately, most sales reps operate the exact opposite way. Here&rsquo;s how most sales reps do it:</p><p> Most sales reps act with desperation to put anyone into their pipeline that will take their information. They are then happy to call these very shaky prospects back and waste their time sending information or revising documents or whatever else they are asked to do. And after this long and frustrating process, the majority of these prospects end up not being a sale. In fact:</p><h3> <strong>  The industry wide closing average is 2 or 3 out of ten prospects! </strong></h3><p> <br/> Think about that for just a moment. Think about all the time, energy, phone calls, voice messages, emails, chasing, and disappointment you have to go through pursuing 7 or 8 prospects through a sales cycle only to have them finally tell you no.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why the response, &ldquo;We always like to lose early&rdquo; is so brilliant. By losing the sale early in the process&mdash;as a direct result of an intensive, first qualifying call, by the way&mdash;we both saved ourselves a lot of work, a lot of time in following up, and the disappointment of a lost deal at the end of it all.</p><p> What this all comes down to is the concept of &ldquo;disqualifying&rdquo; your leads rather than qualifying them just enough to get them into your pipeline. What this allows you to do is spend less time pitching unqualified leads that steal your valuable time. And I&rsquo;m sure you know who I&rsquo;m talking about&hellip;</p><h3> In order to identify non-buyers early on, <a href=\"/category/grow/personal-development/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  get into the habit </a> of asking these types of qualifying questions during the initial call:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I know we&rsquo;re at the very early stages of this but please give me an idea of your time frame for making a decision on something like this.&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;If you like what you see in our demo, what would be the next steps for you?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;What would hold you back from making a decision to move forward on something like this in the next two weeks?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;Besides yourself, who would be making the final decision on this?&rdquo;</p><p> Then layer:</p><p> &ldquo;And what insight do you have on where they are leaning right now?&rdquo;</p><p> And finally,</p><p> &ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve been describing so far, what are your initial thoughts on this?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Related:   <a href=\"/grow/sales-strategy/the-one-metric-that-matters-most-in-sales-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The One Metric That Matters Most in Sales Management  </a> </strong></p><p> If any of these questions reveal that your prospect might not be a good fit or won&rsquo;t buy at this time for any reason, then make a solid note of that and don&rsquo;t become a pest by trying to persuade them to move earlier! The less time you spend pitching bad leads who aren&rsquo;t going to buy, the more time you can spend finding the real buyers.</p><p> This is a big point, so here it is again:</p><p> Top 20% producers spend more time disqualifying out the non-buyers and so less time stuffing unqualified leads into their pipeline hoping they will close. They would rather lose early because it frees them up to find and spend more time with buyers later on. And this is what makes them top producers. </p><p> I challenge you to start losing more sales earlier in <a href=\"/category/grow/sales-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  your sales process, </a> so you can spend more time winning bigger deals more often.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2018-05-08 17:24:04.000000","last_updated":"2018-05-08 17:24:04.000000","image_url":"2018/5/article_placeholder.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/business/the-sooner-you-lose-the-sale-the-better-2/\", \"post_id\": \"30598\", \"post_date\": \"2018-05-08 17:24:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2018-05-08 17:24:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-sooner-you-lose-the-sale-the-better-2\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"30597\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"14389\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sooner-you-lose-sale-better.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"691\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/personal-development/how-to-avoid-perils-commiserating/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2018-05-25\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/09/stop-marketing-build-relationships-influencers/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"78\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://traffic.libsyn.com/andrewlacivita/TipsForWorkAndLife-011-The9FastestWaysToBeAwesomeAtYourCraft.mp3\\n0\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"wpcf-homeslideroption\": \"1\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskw_text_input\": \"performance review phrases\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1525863600,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

I crashed and burned so bad that I thought I never rise again from the ashes. I felt totally defeated!</p><p> The pain and agony of <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/six-habits-that-will-help-you-beat-and-prevent-depression-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   depression  </u> </a> , anxiety and insomnia I experienced were something that I wouldn&rsquo;t wish on my worst enemy. How could I have gone from the happiest person I knew to the most miserable?</p><p> The thought of living the rest of my life in a lethargic state without any  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/are-you-tired-of-being-tired/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   energy  </u>    </a> was enough to push me to the brink of suicide.</p><h3> The effects of defeat can be deadly.</h3><p> <br/> I say that because the most common symptom of defeat is depression. Worse still is that the most severe symptom of depression is suicide.</p><p> When people feel they have no other way out, they simply give up. Without hope for a better future they chose the easy way out today.</p><p> I am grateful for a brother who encouraged me to hang in there and not give up. If he hadn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d be writing this 30 years later. Thirty years of depression-free living and giving myself to the Universe and my  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/3-things-to-help-you-clearly-identify-your-life-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  purpose </a> .</p><p> <strong>  The 5 lessons I learned that have helped me overcome defeat, discouragement and depression are not at all complicated or hard to do, but they could save your life or that of a loved one: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Tell yourself &ldquo;This didn&rsquo;t come to stay, it came to pass!&rdquo; </strong> Write it on sticky notes and post them everywhere. Place one on your mirror so that these are the first words you see every morning. Write these words in your journal. You must learn to encourage yourself, whether or not you feel like it. Do it and the feelings will come later on.</p><p> <strong>  2. Find someone to share your feelings with who has gone through a similar experience. </strong> Only people who have been where you are can honestly say &ldquo;I know where you are coming from.&rdquo; As a rule, the rest of the free advice you will get from your well-meaning friends, family and associates is worth every penny you pay for it. Find a true encourager even if it&rsquo;s online. I have coached people I have never met to step back from the brink of suicide.</p><p> <strong>  3. Realize that everything happens for a reason. </strong> Constantly remind yourself as many times a day as you need to, &ldquo;All things work out for my good!&rdquo; Look for the good in every situation. The fact is: we don&rsquo;t know if a failure is good or bad. Sometimes, missing a flight, which seems like an utter failure and disappointment at the time, can turn out to be a real blessing. Our perspective changes when we hear that the plane which we were supposed to be on, has crashed. It is at that moment that our disappointment turns into gratitude.</p><p> <strong>  4. Learn to view failures as lessons. </strong> There are times what appears to be a defeat is really a setup for something much greater that God has in store for our lives. Closed doors can be a blessing. They keep us from getting stuck in something good and prevent us from discovering the best for our lives. Keep moving along the corridor of life. Keep trying doors. Stop trying to kick them down. Doors that don&rsquo;t open may be locked for a reason.</p><p> <strong>  5. Look up and look ahead. </strong> Stop beating yourself up! Don&rsquo;t keep looking back, you&rsquo;re not headed in that direction. Keep moving ahead with the belief and determination that the right doors will open at the right time. Sometimes the wilderness experience we are going through is simply preparing us for an incredible future ahead.</p><p> Are you are feeling defeated at the moment?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-21 15:04:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-21 15:04:35.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_n1Pbv2Z.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-easy-ways-to-overcome-defeat-when-you-feel-like-quitting/\", \"post_id\": \"5602\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-21 15:04:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-21 15:04:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-easy-ways-to-overcome-defeat-when-you-feel-like-quitting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5601\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2545\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-21-at-8.10.52-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"523\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440443700,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}

Three.) disclaimers right from Jump Street here:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. I believe much of the generational talk out there acts a lot like a self-fulfilling prophecy. </strong> We paint with too broad a brush about this generation or that, and by gosh, wouldn&rsquo;t you know it? They sometimes tend to maybe in some situations act according to their generational stereotypes.</p><p> <strong>  2. That&rsquo;s not to say there&rsquo;s no validity at all to the generational generalizations. </strong></p><p> <strong>  3. And before you&rsquo;re tempted to chalk this post up to me being some crotchety </strong> , cantankerous curmudgeon, please understand that some would consider me part of this generation.</p><h3> So there. Now that we&rsquo;ve gotten that out of the way, let&rsquo;s get to it.</h3><p> <br/> From time to time I have the privilege of speaking with young professionals groups. Here are some tips I often share with folks within those contexts.</p><h3> 1. Avoid the Spray and Pray method of finding your next career stop.</h3><p> Think about what makes you come alive. Consider your skills, abilities, and experience. Now find industries/companies where those things intersect. That&rsquo;s where you should target your search.</p><h3> 2. Find and utilize professional mentors.</h3><p> This is an often-overlooked tool not only for professional growth, but also for networking and exposure.</p><h3> 3. Embrace humility.</h3><p> Stay humble. Stay hungry.</p><h3> 4. Fight perceptions.</h3><p> Fair or not, your generation is often perceived as lazy, entitled, spoiled, etc. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a bum rap; but complaining about it isn&rsquo;t going to help you shatter folks&rsquo; preconceived ideas about you.</p><h3> 5. Quit acting like experience doesn&rsquo;t matter.</h3><p> Please, please, please don&rsquo;t allow yourself to succumb to the temptation to take pot-shots at those with more experience than you. Acknowledge the huge benefit there can be in experiencing things in the workplace, and don&rsquo;t be so quick to equate experience with lack of innovation or some other such nonsense. You hate to be pigeonholed because of your age and experience, so logic would seem to dictate that you shouldn&rsquo;t pigeonhole others for the same reasons.</p><h3> 6. Advanced degrees are great, but they&rsquo;re not the meal ticket you&rsquo;re tempted to think they are.</h3><p> Pursuing advanced degrees just because you&rsquo;re not sure what to do is a terrible idea. If you&rsquo;re not sure what to do, start trying stuff.</p><h3> 7. You&rsquo;re not Lady Gaga, so quit living for the applause, applause, applause.</h3><p> This one&rsquo;s pretty self-explanatory, no?</p><h3> 8. Learn how to think.</h3><p> And not just think at random. Teach yourself to engage in critical thought, contemplation, and so on.</p><h3> 9. Learn the art of asking questions.</h3><p> You know, like Socrates.</p><h3> 10. Serve.</h3><p> Work at being a servant who leads, not someone who merely serves when it&rsquo;s convenient.</p><p> Any tips you&rsquo;d add to the list?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-21 14:05:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-21 14:05:22.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_92KaYos.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-tips-for-young-professionals/\", \"post_id\": \"5600\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-21 14:05:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-21 14:05:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-tips-for-young-professionals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5599\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2544\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-21-at-7.12.37-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"501\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440442800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

In no time at all, we&rsquo;re told, an army of sensors will monitor our every move and take all sorts of actions based on them.</p><p> People who aren&rsquo;t thrilled with this prospect hope the government will implement wise public policy to protect people&rsquo;s security and privacy. But lobbyists for large companies in the industry argue regulation that is too restrictive will limit IoT implementation.</p><p> While the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-november-2013-workshop-entitled-internet-things-privacy/150127iotrpt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Federal Trade Commission  </a> </u>  has emerged as the government&rsquo;s de facto agency related to the IoT, particularly in the context of dubious business practices, it doesn&rsquo;t really have a mandate to control them altogether, writes Darren Samuelsohn in Politico. Moreover, numerous other agencies also see the IoT as part of their purview, such as the NHTSA and the Federal Aviation Administration working on driverless cars and  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/state-cios-juggle-cobol-cloud-and-drones/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   drones  </a> </u> , without their work being coordinated, he adds.</p><p> &ldquo;The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/06/internet-of-things-caucus-legislation-regulation-000086\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   government doesn&rsquo;t have any single mechanism  </a> </u>  to address the Internet of Things or the challenges it&rsquo;s presenting,&rdquo; says Samuelsohn. &ldquo;Instead, the new networked-object technologies are covered by at least two dozen separate federal agencies&mdash;from the Food and Drug Administration to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA], from aviation to agriculture&mdash;and more than 30 different congressional committees. Congress has written no laws or any kind of overarching national strategy specifically for the Internet of Things.&rdquo;</p><p> The problem is that the number of Internet-connected things ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2970017\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gartner predicts  </a> </u>  a quarter billion of them by 2020) isn&rsquo;t waiting around for legislation to be passed. It&rsquo;s growing rapidly, and as we&rsquo;ve learned with other innovative technologies, it can be hard to put the genie back in the bottle and control things retroactively, Samuelsohn writes. On the other hand, too much cumbersome regulation on the front end can kill a nascent industry, as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/faa-drone-regulations-deal-blow-to-amazon/385529/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Amazon  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.techinvestingdaily.com/articles/why-faa-regulations-are-a-win-for-agricultural-drones/583\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   agriculture  </a> </u>  organizations wrestling with drone limits are learning.</p><p> Companies are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/article/2950594/data-center/facebook-amazon-apple-pick-up-spending-on-lobbying.html#tk.rss_lanwan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   spending millions on lobbying  </a> </u>  in an effort to keep regulations from being too onerous.

What sort of security measures are in place to prevent IoT sensors from being controlled by hackers? &ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;ve got a cybersecurity problem now, wait for the cold winter day when a hacker halfway around the world turns down the thermostat on 100,000 homes in Washington D.C.,&rdquo; Marc Rotenberg, the head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told Politico.</p><p> And that could extend to other systems as well, warns the President&rsquo;s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/NSTAC%20Report%20to%20the%20President%20on%20the%20Internet%20of%20Things%20Nov%202014%20%28updat%20%20%20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   November 2014 report  </a> </u> . &ldquo;Critical infrastructure IoT devices are increasingly automated and adaptive, collecting data from the systems they control and then acting on that data; failure of some of these systems would have profound national impact,&rdquo; the report notes. &ldquo;These impacts could be economic (e.g., lost productivity and damage to the national economy) or in the public safety realm (e.g., kinetic damage or in extreme cases potentially catastrophic failure of machinery or infrastructure).&rdquo;</p><p> To make matters worse, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/interop/iot-get-security-right-the-first-time/a/d-id/1278612?itc=edit_in_body_cross\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   industry doesn&rsquo;t have a great track record  </a> </u>  in that area, writes Patrick Oliver Graf inInformationWeek. &ldquo;Unfortunately, the technology industry has a long history of ignoring security in the rush to open new markets, and we may see it happen again with IoT,&rdquo; he writes.</p><p> &ldquo;The underlying challenge is that there are no clear and agreed upon architectures for building such systems,&rdquo; explains Sanjay Sarma, an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/06/internet-of-things-privacy-risks-security-000096\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   engineer who pioneered work  </a> </u>  into what we now call the IoT. &ldquo;Your light switch might have one level of encryption and your remote another. One may use Zigbee, another Bluetooth, and yet another WiFi. Bridges to connect across them will abound. Even if independent systems are secure, we will cobble together systems, and the chain will only be as strong as the weakest link.&rdquo;</p><p> What the IoT needs, Sarma goes on to say, is something similar to what the Internet itself had from early on: an organization, like the Advanced Research Projects Agency, that helps agree on protocols, like TCP/IP, that all IoT products use to make it easier for them to share information securely.

In a report entitled <a href=\"http://www.bettermarkets.com/costofthecrsis\" target=\"_blank\"> The Cost of the Crisis: $20 Trillion </a> and counting, Better Markets, a nonprofit designed to support financial regulatory reform, tabulated the cost of the crisis on the economy and the American people on the fifth anniversary of the passage of Dodd-Frank regulatory reform legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the stock market has recovered the ground lost during the financial crisis, the real economy is still stuck in neutral. Millions of Americans are unemployed or underemployed, and hundreds of thousands have lost homes due to foreclosures. According to the report, the costs to the economy caused by the crisis include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>$800 billion stimulus bill passed by Congress</li>\r\n\t<li>$15 billion in completed foreclosures</li>\r\n\t<li>$116 billion decrease in small business lending</li>\r\n\t<li>$2.8 trillion decrease in value of 401(k) plans and IRAs</li>\r\n\t<li>$24 billion decrease in government research and development spending</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The deregulation of the late 1990s and early 2000s fueled a rise in risk-taking behavior by Wall Street banks and other financial institutions that led to the financial crisis. It&rsquo;s no accident that Wall Street&rsquo;s share of total domestic corporate profits rose from less than 10 percent in the last 1940s to just over 40 percent before the financial crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the financial crisis, the vast majority of too big to fail banks were either directly or indirectly bailed out by the government, rather than being allowed to go bankrupt. The incredibly costly recovery from the bank-inspired crisis has been borne by the taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lack of accountability surround the crisis is mind-boggling. It behooves us to ensure that the regulations that have been passed since the crisis to re-regulate Wall Street are not watered down, ignored or unenforced. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s almost certain that another, similar crisis will occur in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iris.xyz/advisor-tools/barriers-to-creating-an-integrated-customer-centric-advisory/\">Barriers to Creating an Integrated Customer-Centric Advisory</a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-20 20:43:30.000000","last_updated":"2021-01-20 20:20:24.836000","image_url":"2015/8/toll-of-financial-crisis-30-trillion-counting.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":"","white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"<p>While the stock market has recovered the ground lost during the financial crisis, the real economy is still stuck in neutral. #stockmarket</p>","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/toll-of-financial-crisis-30-trillion-counting/\", \"post_id\": \"5596\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-20 20:43:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-20 20:43:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"toll-of-financial-crisis-30-trillion-counting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5595\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2542\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-20-at-1.47.54-PM-2_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"620\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":49410,"author_id":23,"chart_url":""}

Many people now are finding they want to  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3343868/its-time-to-rename-retirement/\" target=\"_blank\">   continue working doing something they enjoy  </a> </u> .</p><p> By adding extra income and increasing spending in different years, you get a better look at how things will look year by year while in &ldquo;retirement&rdquo;. Running multiple scenarios also helps to spot potential adjustments when things don&rsquo;t go according to plan.</p><p> In my latest  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3614783/real-purpose-financial-planning/\" target=\"_blank\">   MONEY article  </a> </u> , I discussed one client&rsquo;s decision making while answering the question if she could retire early.  The story breaks down the different alternatives discussed to help this client gain the confidence to retire early.</p><h3> Renaming Retirement</h3><p> <br/> Once you know it&rsquo;s financially feasible, the next question is what you plan on doing after you retire early?</p><p> For many,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.moneysense.ca/retire/is-travel-in-retirement-overrated\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the most common answer is traveling  </a> </u> .  But do you really intend to travel the majority of the time when no longer working?</p><p> Surprisingly, we have seen more people  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3343868/its-time-to-rename-retirement/\" target=\"_blank\">   retire only to go back to work  </a> </u> . But the definition of the word &ldquo;retire&rdquo; includes the phrase &ldquo;ceasing to work.&rdquo; So is &ldquo;retire&rdquo; really the best word to describe the reality for most folks today?</p><p> We actually like some of the other phrases being used to rename retirement like what  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelkitces\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Kitces  </a> </u>  describes as  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/financial-independence-in-lieu-of-retirement-and-other-phrases-that-should-be-banished-from-retirement-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Financial Independence&rdquo;  </a> </u>  or what  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonchevreau\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jon Chevreau  </a> </u>  has coined &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.findependenceday.com/cms/2014/12/12/the-word-retirement-scares-off-young-people-lets-replace-it-with-findependence/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Findependence  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> Chris Farrell, a writer for Bloomberg Businessweek, has written a book titled  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-unretirement-by-chris-farrell-1411511058?autologin=y\" target=\"_blank\">   Unretirement  </a> </u>  which discusses how baby boomers are changing the way they think about work &ndash; in particular &ndash; how they plan to continue working.</p><p> Regardless what we call it, we still have to be comfortable understanding the risks of potential elongated periods with no employment income.</p><h3> How Will You React?</h3><p> <br/> Before making this move, it&rsquo;s important to understand your comfort with drops in your savings.</p><p> Some people making this transition will choose to earn more income. But for those that don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s critical to understand your tolerance for risk.</p><p> Do you remember how you felt in 2007-2009?</p><p> What was your reaction during this time?  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3537655/anxiety-stocks-dropping-relax/\" target=\"_blank\">   The answers to these questions  </a> </u>  can have a big impact on how you will feel while in retirement. But it&rsquo;s likely to feel even worse, knowing that you are now pulling from your assets verses contributing.</p><p> Understanding how much risk you need in your portfolio to sustain your desired spending levels is an essential part of the decision-making before giving your final two-week notice.</p><h3> Great Opportunities</h3><p> <br/> For those that have saved diligently, retiring early can create incredible opportunities.</p><p> This is especially true when you&rsquo;ve saved in accounts with different tax treatment for withdrawals and have low guaranteed annual pension payments.</p><p> Many don&rsquo;t realize the flexibility that is created when you have control over your taxable income each year. Having savings in a Roth IRA, HSA, or high basis in a brokerage account, gives you the option to avoid moving in to a higher tax bracket for necessary withdrawals near the end of a year.</p><h3> Common Questions</h3><p> We&rsquo;ve heard a long list of questions in discussing this topic with clients through the years and have answered the following questions in other blog posts. Here are some of the most common:</p><li> How will I begin  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/6-retirement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   withdrawing from my savings  </a> </u> ?</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/dynamic-withdrawal-strategy-2nd-gamma-component/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How much should I begin withdrawing  </a> </u> ?</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/tax-planning-social-security/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   When should I start taking Social Security?  </a> </u></li><li> Which  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-the-new-premium-assistance-tax-credit-under-obamacare/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   health insurance plan should I choose  </a> </u> ?</li><li> Do I take an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/lump-sum-annuity-question-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   annuity or a lump sum  </a> </u>  from my pension? <br/>  </li><h3> Are You Ready?</h3><p> <br/> By asking the questions mentioned above, you can prepare for a successful transition to the next phase of your life.</p><p> That may be a long and prosperous retirement or a more flexible work arrangement doing something you truly love.

{"original_id":2480,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Reason You Keep Getting In Your Own Way and How to Avoid It","link":"the-reason-you-keep-getting-in-your-own-way-and-how-to-avoid-it","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There is an old saying about the definition of insanity. That it&rsquo;s doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We&rsquo;ve all experienced this phenomenon in business, and in life. So why does it keep happening, and how can we prevent it? First, we have to understand how we get our results.</p><p> Where do results come from? Simply put, results are outcomes of our actions and behaviors. And very often when we don&rsquo;t get the result we want, we look to those actions or behaviors to diagnose where we went wrong. Then we switch out old actions for new ones and try again. (No response to your email? Perhaps a stronger headline or that red exclamation point will do the trick!) But this is a shortsighted and usually futile exercise, because results start father back in the equation&hellip; in a far less tangible place.</p><p> It is our  thinking  that drives our actions and behaviors. And our thinking is created by a complex combination of our values, beliefs, experiences and habits of thought created slowly over time. Larry Senn, founder of  <u>  <a href=\"http://senndelaney.com/company.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Senn Delaney Leadership Consulting  </a> </u> , sums it up well as &lsquo;insights&rsquo; in his model, The Results Cone. Larry&rsquo;s model says that insights inform our thinking, our thinking drives our behaviors and our behaviors create our results. So when the results go wrong we often must trace back, past the actions/behaviors, to the thinking that created them to diagnose where we went wrong. And hopefully, when we do, we can have new insights that change our thinking, and therefore our result.</p><p> What we have found in our work at Storyforge, is that one particular insight has a disproportionate impact on quality and consistency of results for the businesses we support: that is a shift in thinking that is tied to purpose.</p><p> Consider famously successful NYC restauranteur Danny Meyer. He defines his purpose, and the purpose of all of his businesses in a surprising way: &ldquo;You may think, as I once did, that I&rsquo;m primarily in the business of serving good food. Actually, though, food is secondary to something that matters even more. In the end, what&rsquo;s most meaningful is creating positive, uplifting outcomes for human experiences and human relationships.&rdquo; Imagine how his employees might act, and the decisions they might be empowered to make in the moment through this purpose? Would his recruiters hire for technical skills or attitude? How would his managers approach performance management? How might his executive chef deal differently with his suppliers and vendors?</p><p> Purpose becomes the filter for your thinking. When employees understand their purpose, and have insights about the role they play in fulfilling that purpose, their thinking &ndash; and how they translate that thinking into actions &ndash; can create extraordinary different results.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-20 19:44:04.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-20 19:44:04.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_DcHrfQ9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-reason-you-keep-getting-in-your-own-way-and-how-to-avoid-it/\", \"post_id\": \"5588\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-20 19:44:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-20 19:44:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-reason-you-keep-getting-in-your-own-way-and-how-to-avoid-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5587\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2537\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1440030604002-1a3914a69c92-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"767\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440169200,"author_id":53,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2479,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Ways Technology Has Changed How We Treat Website Redesign","link":"5-ways-technology-has-changed-how-we-treat-website-redesign","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> There are very few industries that have not gone through significant changes in the past 10 years thanks to technological advancements. Cutting-edge fields like medicine are always advancing, of course. But thanks to new technologies, now so are traditional and industrial fields like home builders and manufacturing.</p><p> It might not come as a surprise that website redesign would change so much &mdash; after all, it&rsquo;s based in the very vehicle of that change, the Internet. But what&rsquo;s really interesting is seeing how individual technological advancements such as the mobile device and tablet have changed the industry as a whole. Of course, it&rsquo;s a lot more than just phones and tablets, and that&rsquo;s the topic of today&rsquo;s blog.</p><p> Interested in how website redesign has morphed over the years? Here are five ways that developments in technology have changed website redesign as you know it:</p><h3> 1. Getting Internet on Your Phone Inspired Responsive Design</h3><p> <br/> Most website redesign projects today have  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/what-is-responsive-website-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   responsive design  </a> </u>  on the to-do list, especially since the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/definitions-content-marketing-words/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mobilegeddon  </a> </u>  Google update. 27% of people will leave a site if it is not mobile-optimized (source: ExactTarget, 2014 Mobile Behavior Report), and 61% of companies have created a mobile site or optimized their existing site for mobile (source: Chief Marketer, Mobile Marketing Survey 2012). Thanks to technology and the development of different sizes of mobile devices, your website has to look good on several different kinds of screens. That means that during a website redesign, you must carefully plan out your design to meet the needs of your customers when they view the website on a mobile device.</p><h3> 2. Mobile Data Plans Limit Web Page Sizes</h3><p> <br/> Mobile technology is responsible for another big change, too: the size (load time) of websites. Since most customers sign up for a specific mobile phone plan with a data limit, marketers need to take website page sizes into consideration when they go through a website redesign. You can have the most beautiful and targeted website ever, but if it takes  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/bad-websites-lose-visitors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more than 10 seconds to load  </a> </u>  it won&rsquo;t achieve your marketing goals. Marketers and designers, then, need to be responsible with the file size of web pages.</p><h3> 3. Testing Opportunities Leave No Excuse for Bad Performance</h3><p> <br/> Technological advancement also comes in the form of new services. Now that websites and digital traffic are incredibly important factors of business success, companies have developed tools to allow you to do browser testing and  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/website-brand-identity-overlooked/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  device testing </a>  during your website redesign. This means that there&rsquo;s no excuse for poor performance once your website is live because you have all the tools you need to make sure the website achieves optimal performance.</p><h3> 4. Wearable Technology Challenges Our Assumptions</h3><p> <br/> Who can talk about technology without discussing the ever-shrinking screen sizes of wearable technology? The best example right now is the Apple Watch, an expensive gadget that many early adopters are trying out. As screens get smaller and smaller, website designers will need to take this into account when they design these sites. And it also points to a future without screens as we know them today:  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ventureharbour.com/19-implications-google-glass-wearable-tech-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Glass  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/virtual-reality-advertising-s-big-thing/294328/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   virtual reality devices  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/npr-running-voice-recognition-enabled-ads-156614\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   voice technology  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 5. Lower Attention Spans and Higher Expectations Lead to Simpler Designs</h3><p> <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/b/42391c48-36dc-4ff9-8a3c-05dc1b0da484\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   decline of the American attention span  </a> </u>  thanks to technology has been well-documented over the years. But with this lower attention span comes a higher expectation for user experience. The less interested or entertained a visitor is, the less likely he will be to stick around. When it comes to website redesign, this means that simple and clear will trump complicated and confusing. Website designs that speak directly to the visitor&rsquo;s needs will be the priority over flashy design.</p><p> Every industry faces change over time. It&rsquo;s a fact of life as individuals and businesses learn more about themselves and the world outside of them. But in the field of website redesign, at least, you can point to specific technological advancements that helped encourage these changes.</p><p> How has technology changed since your company&rsquo;s last website redesign? Is it time to re-evaluate your website in light of technological changes? <br/>  </p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p><p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-20 19:43:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-20 19:43:02.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_1NeNGGf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-ways-technology-has-changed-how-we-treat-website-redesign/\", \"post_id\": \"5586\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-20 19:43:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-20 19:43:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-ways-technology-has-changed-how-we-treat-website-redesign\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5585\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2536\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-20-at-12.49.30-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"757\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440180000,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}

Give Yourself the Gift of Forgiveness","link":"stuck-in-a-grudge-give-yourself-the-gift-of-forgiveness","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Do you consider yourself a forgiving person? We have all experienced that person who rubs us the wrong way or a situation that make us angry.  When these things happen, do you tend to hold a grudge, or do you easily forgive? </p><h3> Using the character strength of forgiveness, we let go of negative feelings, past hurts, and grudges.  </h3><p> <br/> We favor instead accepting others&rsquo; shortcomings, making amends and giving people second chances. In her book The How of Happiness: A New Approach to Getting the Life You Want, Sonja Lyubomirsky wrote that when we forgive, we replace desires to avoid the person or get revenge with more positive feelings and behaviors.  <br/> <br/> In the past, I&rsquo;ve been slow to forgive and the grudges I&rsquo;ve held have festered into bitterness, anger, or detachment from the people I was begrudging. Now, I&rsquo;m practicing letting go of those grudges and have been forgiving people much more quickly. For me, it&rsquo;s not as easy as waving the magic wand and saying &ldquo;I forgive you.&rdquo; When it was difficult, I found forgiveness with the help of the following exercises: </p><li> <strong>  Reflect on when I&rsquo;ve been forgiven. </strong> Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to forgive others after remembering the times that we ourselves have been forgiven.

{"original_id":2477,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Sleep Apnea as You Get Older","link":"sleep-apnea-as-you-get-older","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Over the years, I have written and spoken about the dangers of untreated sleep apnea. We know that it is associated with an increased incidence of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Additionally, numerous studies show that those with untreated sleep apnea tend to die at a younger age. In fact, according to a study published in the  New England Journal of Medicine  in 2005 titled  Obstructive Sleep Apnea as a Risk Factor for Stroke and Death , the chances of having a stroke or dying was double in those with sleep apnea when followed over several years.</p><p> I am frequently confronted by skeptical patients, listeners, and readers. They usually want to know how sleep apnea can cause these numerous problems. On occasion, someone has asked, &ldquo;How do I know you aren&rsquo;t just making this stuff up?&rdquo; I perfectly understand their skepticism. After all, the field of sleep medicine is one of the newest of the medical disciplines and we are only recently coming to understand the importance of sleep in regards to our health.</p><p> A study published in the journal Sleep Medicine in 2014 titled  The History of Sleep Apnea is Associated with Shorter Leukocyte Telomere Length: the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study  recently caught my eye. I was in the process of preparing a talk on the subject of sleep apnea and premature death when I came across it. In the study, the authors were able to demonstrate the premature shortening of telomeres in people with sleep apnea.</p><p> Telomeres are the protective protein caps at the end of chromosomes that affect how quickly cells age. In recent years, shorter telomeres have become associated with a broad range of ageing-related diseases, including many forms of cancer, stroke, vascular dementia, cardiovascular disease, obesity, osteoporosis, and diabetes.</p><p> We believe that telomeres can be damaged by a process called oxidative stress. This is brought on by repetitive and rapid decreases in blood oxygen levels. This results in the formation of damaging free radicals. Unfortunately, this very process goes on nightly in people with undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea.</p><p> The importance of this and other studies is that we are now gaining insight into the actual mechanisms that cause the damage in untreated sleep disorders. When I first started in this field, we had population studies that clearly demonstrated the risk of untreated sleep apnea. What was lacking was knowledge of the actual dysfunctional mechanisms responsible for the unfortunate consequences.</p><p> The take home message is that we now clearly understand the dangers of sleep apnea. As I mention in my book  Sleep Soundly Every Night, Feel Fantastic Every Day , it is estimated that one in every fifteen Americans has sleep apnea, or close to 7% of the population. Unfortunately, only 20% of those have been diagnosed and are being treated. That leaves many of our fellow Americans at great risk for an unnecessary and premature death. If you or a loved one snores chronically or has other symptoms associated with sleep apnea such as sleepiness, fatigue, frequent night time urination, morning headaches, or problems with memory, make sure to discuss it with your health care provider. Sleep apnea is easy to diagnose and treat.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-20 18:34:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-20 18:34:00.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_BtPmbau.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/sleep-apnea-as-you-get-older/\", \"post_id\": \"5582\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-20 18:34:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-20 18:34:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"sleep-apnea-as-you-get-older\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5581\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2534\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sleep-apnea.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1387\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440144000,"author_id":157,"chart_url":""}

But before he packed up his sketchpad, pencils, awards, tributes, and memoirs, he spoke to his employees for the last time. 48 years have passed since Leo delivered this speech and much has changed in the world of advertising &ndash; but not the values and tenets of his message. Read it, or watch it, and you&rsquo;ll know why.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/7WUxb8YB88o\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://www.youtube.com/embed/7WUxb8YB88o </a></p><p> <strong>  Leo Burnett &ndash; </strong> &ldquo;Somewhere along the line, after I&rsquo;m finally off the premises,  you &ndash; or your successors &ndash; may want to take my name off the premises, too. You may want to call yourselves &rdquo; Twain, Rogers, Sawyer and Finn, Inc.&rdquo;&hellip;.. or &ldquo;Ajax Advertising&rdquo; or something. That will certainly be OK with me &ndash; if it&rsquo;s good for you. <strong>  But let me tell you when I might demand that you take my name off the door. That will be the day when you spend more time trying to make money and less time making advertising &ndash; our kind of advertising. </strong></p><p> When you forget that the sheer fun of ad making and the lift you get out of it &ndash; the creative climate of the place &ndash; should be as important as money to the very special breed of writers and artists and business professionals who compose this company of ours &ndash; and make it tick.</p><p> When you lose that restless feeling that nothing you do is ever quite good enough. When you lose your itch to the job well for it&rsquo;s own sake &ndash; regardless of the client, or money, or the effort it takes. When you lose your passion for thoroughness&hellip;your hatred of loose ends. When you stop reaching the manner, the overtones, the marriage of words and pictures that produce the fresh, the memorable and the believable effect. When you stop rededicating yourselves every day to the idea that better advertising is what the Leo Burnett Company is about. When you are no longer what Thoreau called &ldquo;a corporation with a conscience&rdquo; &ndash; which means to me, a corporation of conscientious men and women. When you begin to compromise your integrity &ndash; which has always been the heart&rsquo;s blood &ndash; the very guts of this agency. When you stoop to convenient expediency and rationalize yourselves into acts of opportunism &ndash; for the sake of a fast buck. When you show the slightest sign of crudeness, inappropriateness or smart&ndash;aleckness &ndash; and you lose that subtle sense of the fitness of things. When your main interest becomes a matter of size just to be big &ndash; rather that good, hard, wonderful work. When your outlook narrows down to the number of windows &ndash; from zero to five &ndash; in the walls of your office. When you lose your humility and become big-short wisenheimers&hellip;. a little bit too big for your boots. When the apples come down to being just apples for eating (or for polishing) &ndash; no longer part of our tone or personality.When you disprove of something, and start tearing the hell out of the man who did it rather than the work itself. When you stop building on strong and vital ideas, and start a routine production line. When you start believing that, in the interest of efficiency, a creative spirit and the urge to create can be delegated and administrated, and forget that they can only be nurtured, stimulated, and inspired. When you start giving lip service to this being a &ldquo;creative agency&rdquo; and stop really being one.</p><p> Finally, when you lose your respect for the &ndash; the man at his typewriter or his drawing board or behind his camera or just scribbling notes with one of our big pencils &ndash; or working all night on a media plan. When you forget that the lonely man &ndash; and thank God for him &ndash; he has made the agency we now have &ndash; possible. When you forget he&rsquo;s the man who, because he is reaching harder, sometimes actually gets hold of for a moment &ndash; one of those hot, unreachable stars.</p><p> THAT, boys and girls, is when I shall insist you take my name off the door. And by golly, it will be taken off the door. Even if I have to materialize long enough some night to rub it out myself &ndash; on every one of our floors. And before I de-materialize again, I will paint out that star-reaching symbol too. And burn all the stationary. Perhaps tear up a few ads in passing. And throw every god-damned apple down the elevator shafts. You just won&rsquo;t know the place, the next morning. You&rsquo;ll have to find another name.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  John Bell &ndash; </strong> And so . . . after 80 years, the name &lsquo;Leo Burnett&rsquo; remains on the door of the venerable advertising agency. Along the way, I made a stop at Burnett as an account executive on Procter &amp; Gamble. The year was 1973. Day one on the job, my boss played the 1967 speech on a reel-to-reel tape machine. Back then, Leo&rsquo;s words inspired everyone in the advertising agency. Today, those words inspire everyone in advertising.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-20 18:06:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-20 18:06:12.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_wPNKWkF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-to-take-my-name-off-the-door-by-guest-blogger-leo-burnett/\", \"post_id\": \"5580\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-20 18:06:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-20 18:06:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-to-take-my-name-off-the-door-by-guest-blogger-leo-burnett\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5579\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2533\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-20-at-11.16.47-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"985\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440165600,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}

(come on, don&rsquo;t lie, I do too)</li><li> Give it away to someone else / return it to the library?</li><li> Remove it from your Kindle to reduce the clutter?</li>Or anything else along the lines of just moving on to the next thing as you would after seeing a movie?If yes, then you&rsquo;re missing out on a massive opportunity to capitalize on and retain the knowledge from that book.Most of us read passively. We scan the information (frequently in between text messages and tweets) and hope that there will be a useful nugget or two that we can apply to our life.But when we read like that, we walk away from the book with little actionable material and quickly forget everything we just learned.What a waste! With the right method, you can treat nonfiction books as<strong>  active learning opportunities</strong>, and you can build a system for yourself so that you <strong> never forget the important parts of what you read.</strong>I&rsquo;ve already talked about how <u> <a href=\"http://www.nateliason.com/can-easily-read-100-books-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  you can easily read 100 books a year </a></u>. Here is how to make the most of those books.<h3> 1. Find the Books</h3>If you&rsquo;re reading nonfiction to learn something or do something (new skill, fitness, <u> <a href=\"http://www.nateliason.com/meditation-performance-enhancing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  meditation </a></u>, etc.), then your book selection is very, very important.The best thing you can do is to listen to the pros, not the masses. Amazon is an easy platform to game. If someone wants to buy fake reviews for their book (<u> I swear I&rsquo;ve never done that</u>), then all they have to do is look around <u> <a href=\"https://www.fiverr.com/s2/594ae59faa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Fiverr </a></u>.<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/5b23dd19340939b15a68df89_Fiverr-Book-Reviews-700x486.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Fiverr book reviews\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/5b23dd19340939b15a68df89_Fiverr-Book-Reviews-700x486.png?resize=652%2C453\"/></a>3,300 people waiting to tell you how much they loved your bookDon&rsquo;t decide based on which books have been &ldquo;rated&rdquo; the highest but <strong> focus on what the best people in whatever you&rsquo;re trying to get good at are recommending.</strong>If you&rsquo;re not sure what they&rsquo;re recommending&hellip; email them and ask! I&rsquo;ve almost never been turned away when asking for book recommendations. People love giving advice.There&rsquo;s one way to make your selection even better, though: look for common denominators. If you want to get better at marketing, then find a few people who are pros at it, get their recommendations, and then see what books they&rsquo;re all recommending. One person may have liked a useless book for whatever reason, but if they all have a couple books in common that they swear by? That&rsquo;s a good sign.With your initial list of books, it&rsquo;s time to&hellip;<h3> 2. Read and Take Notes</h3>With non-fiction, you can read FAST. Take some time to learn how to <u> <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/06/09/speed-reading/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  speed read </a></u> and practice using those techniques non-fiction books.Sidenote: Don&rsquo;t do this for Fiction since the point there is to enjoy it, but for nonfiction it&rsquo;s excellent for quick information absorption.As you read, highlight the parts of the book that seem relevant or worth remembering. The easiest way to do this is to use a <u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Kindle-Paperwhite-High-Resolution-Display/dp/B00OQVZDJM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439471128&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=kindle&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=natsite-20&amp;linkId=8a79625bde2d933d5b92ae04ee036a4b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Kindle </a></u> or the Mac Kindle Reader since they have quick highlighting features built into them.But, if you prefer old school paper books (and yes, I recognize that &ldquo;old school&rdquo; here means ~6 years ago), then sticky notes or sticky tabs work fine too.<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/5b23dd28d09b869570cfc4b5_Willpower-Instinct-Notes-700x525.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Willpower Instinct Notes\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/5b23dd28d09b869570cfc4b5_Willpower-Instinct-Notes-700x525.jpg?resize=700%2C525\"/></a>Still trying to figure out how to charge this thingThe more you read like this, the better you&rsquo;ll get at separating the useful content from the chaff. Most (good) books follow the same logical progression used by philosophy and argumentation. You&rsquo;ll start to identify premises, intermediate conclusions, and final conclusions as you read each new book, and will quickly realize what parts you can skip.Now, once that book is done, <strong> don&rsquo;t</strong> immediately take your notes out. Wait on that. Instead, go read a couple more books related to it (assuming you&rsquo;re going deep in this field, otherwise just read any book) and start a list of books you need to &ldquo;take notes from.&rdquo;I keep an <u> <a href=\"http://www.evernote.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Evernote </a></u> note of all the books I finished and haven&rsquo;t taken notes on so I can go back later and extract them.<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/5b23dd3613f80e4e6c73541c_Books-to-take-notes-from.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Evernote books to take notes from\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/5b23dd3613f80e4e6c73541c_Books-to-take-notes-from.png?resize=466%2C307\"/></a>If you can guess what book &ldquo;EMO&rdquo; is, I&rsquo;ll send you a free copy. Put your guess in the comments. No cheating if you&rsquo;ve read it.Why wait before taking out notes? Two reasons:<strong> First</strong>, the information needs time to settle a bit in your head.You&rsquo;ll put more of the info into long-term memory if you extend the time between your first and second exposure. Waiting a few days or weeks before re-reading the relevant points will help you remember it better later.<strong> Second</strong>, you&rsquo;ll be spending the time in the interim reading other books.If the books are on similar topics, then you&rsquo;ll find that some ideas are shared between them and others only crop up once or twice.If an idea only comes up in one place, you can be a little skeptical of it. But if some piece of advice is in <strong> every</strong> marketing book (for example) then it&rsquo;s probably worth taking note of.Taking notes like this is also an effective way to select books to not finish or read less carefully. If you&rsquo;re reading and not taking any notes, that could be a good sign that it&rsquo;s not that useful of a nonfiction book. There are exceptions (<u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/10%25-Happier-Self-Help-Actually-Works--/dp/0062265431/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439515202&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=10%25+happier&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=natsite-20&amp;linkId=d1d27142c276da9c09d3a357fddb48fc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  10% happier </a></u>, for example, doesn&rsquo;t have a ton of takeaways but is wonderful), but in general an &ldquo;educational&rdquo; book that isn&rsquo;t worth highlighting is a waste of your time.Alright, you&rsquo;ve let it sit and read some more, now it&rsquo;s time to&hellip;<h3> 3. Extract Your Notes</h3>Here&rsquo;s the thing, though: don&rsquo;t just skip straight to your notes and start copying them out. You&rsquo;ll miss out on a lot of useful information.Instead, skim the whole book quickly, stopping briefly at the points where you made notes. This way you&rsquo;ll refresh the context of each note, and you&rsquo;ll naturally pick up on other pieces of information surrounding it that you didn&rsquo;t realize were important at the time.Why? Because now that you have a high-level understanding of the whole book, you&rsquo;ll understand how the individual parts fit into it, and might pick up on things you missed the first time.Pull out all of the necessary bits and make notes wherever you like. I use <u> <a href=\"http://www.evernote.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Evernote </a></u> again since then you can plug anything into your search bar in the future and find any notes you took related to that topic from any book.Then, when you&rsquo;re done taking the notes out of your book, just remove it from your list of books to take notes on!You&rsquo;ll have all of the useful information from that book to reference in the future, and you can combine these notes with your info from other books to get a more comprehensive take on the topic.<h3> Wait, Do You Ever Use the Notes?</h3>One question I always get when I tell people this method is:&ldquo;Do you ever actually go back and look at the notes?&rdquo;Yes and no. Sometimes I do, but frequently I don&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s a good thing.What you&rsquo;ll find is that when you use this method: carefully reading, highlighting, letting it sit, then going back and taking notes, <strong> you&rsquo;ll remember 10x as much of the book as you normally do.</strong>The notes are more a system for helping you identify and remember the most important parts of the book, and storing it in long-term memory through the process of transcribing it. Having a physical copy is just a useful backup.So even if you&rsquo;re never going back to the notes, you&rsquo;re still getting a tremendous boost to your ability to retain the knowledge from the books.<h3> Step by Step</h3>To summarize, instead of just reading through a non-fiction book and laying it down to be forgotten:<li> Pick your books based on what the pros recommend, not the masses</li><li> Get better at speed reading to read your non-fiction quickly</li><li> Highlight important parts as you go</li><li> Finish the book and add it to your list of books to take notes from</li><li> Let the book sit for a week or two</li><li> Go back to the book, skim it quickly stopping at the highlighted parts, and take notes</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-20 17:34:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-20 17:34:34.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_ePQ1LNw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-never-forget-books-you-read/\", \"post_id\": \"5578\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-20 17:34:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-20 17:34:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-never-forget-books-you-read\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5577\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2532\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rounded_library_shelves_books_istock_000032976972_900x450.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1682\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440181800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

You can define its mission. Its values. Its policies and procedures &hellip; But you cannot define the culture.</p><p> <strong>  Culture is made up of 2 things. </strong></p><li> <strong>  The way things are actually done. </strong></li><li> <strong>  How people feel about the way the way things are actually done. </strong></li><p> <br/> Until people actually start doing things and feeling whatever way they feel about it, you cannot define your organization&rsquo;s culture. Until that happens, your culture does not exist.</p><h3> Sorry.</h3><p> The good news is, while you cannot define culture, you can definitely influence it.</p><p> Since culture is made up of the way things are done and the feelings surrounding it, the way you influence it is by clearly defining and consistently managing the other areas.</p><p> When your vision, mission, values, policies and procedures are defined and management is making sure the spirit of these are followed in how the work is done, your culture will be positively influenced. Your culture will develop and flourish to make your organization a place where people want to work and never leave. Your employees will have good attendance, meet the deadlines of their duties and turnover will be at a minimum. They will speak positively about your organization to others. They will be ambassadors of your brand. They will be kind to customers, vendors and each other. Your company will be successful. Others will take notice and want to replicate what you&rsquo;re doing &hellip; And that&rsquo;s when you know your culture is on the right track!</p><p> However, when your vision is blurry, your mission is impossible, your values are worthless and you have no clear policies or procedures, your culture will be negatively influenced. And if you have all these things but aren&rsquo;t educating and enforcing them, your culture will truly suck! Because the only thing employees hate worse than having an undefined workplace is having a workplace riddled with disparity and hypocrisy.</p><p> If your culture takes a negative turn, you will see attendance problems, missed deadlines, insubordinate and insolate behaviors as well as high turnover start to become the norm in your organization. Your employees will not speak positively about your organization. They will not be kind to customers, vendors or each other. The success of your company will suffer. Your doors may not permanently close &mdash; but you will lag behind your competition and you will look on enviously at others who grow at a pace faster than yours.</p><p> If your workplace is starting to look or sound like this, the way to fix it is NOT by defining (or worse &ldquo;re-defining&rdquo;) your culture.</p><p> Employee engagement event planning won&rsquo;t help either. You cannot &ldquo;potluck&rdquo; your way out of bad culture.</p><p> The only way to get your culture back on track is to start enforcing what you&rsquo;ve already identified as the way things are to be done in your organization. Go back to the basics are start living the things you&rsquo;ve already said your organization is about. But leave culture out of it.

Having no experience as a reporter, nor a journalism degree, I was being asked to identify what made my clients compelling (people, products, services, technology), write the story in journalistic style&mdash;without hype&mdash;and then pitch with all my might in hopes of securing coverage.</p><h3> I had to quickly perfect my storytelling skills and be able to continually identify the news over the snooze.</h3><p> <br/> Back in one of my first jobs, in auditing, I did my share of &ldquo;investigative&rdquo; work, but the resulting papers weren&rsquo;t exactly stories. Although some of my findings may have been compelling, I never had to sell the information to anyone for promotional purposes. I just documented with my No. 2 red pencil and moved along to another financial statement.</p><p> Then, having spent nearly a decade in a traditional marketing environment, my brain was accustomed to jumping on the latest product development, bonus feature, or upgrade as if it were breaking news. Although I was used to selling the &ldquo;value,&rdquo; I was also accustomed to selling the features of my clients&rsquo; products and brands. Another brand attribute meant more bullet points on a sell sheet, ammunition for sales reps, and potential enhancement to an existing marketing campaign.</p><p> Journalists (and readers) don&rsquo;t care much for bullet points that don&rsquo;t relay the benefits of a product or service and demonstrate that something has occurred or changed.</p><p> <strong>  As we craft our writing, we must continually be asking ourselves: </strong></p><li> What does the product or service do that people would care about?</li><li> Does it solve a common or important problem?</li><li> Does it improve health, appearance, or love life, or save time and money?</li><li> Does it help one&rsquo;s career, a business, or an investment? Is it informative, poignant, humorous, sexy, provocative, or inspiring? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Of course, these all take us back to that crucial question, &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Facts are essential&mdash;we can&rsquo;t overhype or oversell the story&mdash;but unless we&rsquo;re dealing with breaking news, facts are not always enough. What&rsquo;s the story? Is that story compelling to anyone other than the client, or is it a big snooze?</p><p> Working hard to tell a good story will be much more likely to generate coverage. The snooze-worthy, superficial approach will probably go directly into the reporter&rsquo;s trash folder.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-20 14:18:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-20 14:18:44.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_gS6HfnL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-your-pitches-newsworthy-or-snooze-worthy/\", \"post_id\": \"5568\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-20 14:18:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-20 14:18:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-your-pitches-newsworthy-or-snooze-worthy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5567\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2527\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-20-at-7.23.27-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"993\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440160200,"author_id":38,"chart_url":""}

It's All about Style","link":"selling-to-people-different-than-you-its-all-about-style","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whether in boardrooms or news reports, there is much discussion these days about the generation known as  <strong>  Millennials </strong> . For those in sales, the challenge is to successfully communicate and breakthrough to this group, also known as Generation Y. They are coming of age, making purchasing decisions and scaring the willies out of every marketer, it seems. </p><p> While selling to this specific demographic might seem especially challenging to some of us, it's really important to understand that they are not just a generation, but individuals with unique needs and expectations. Once we identify those, it will be easier on them and ultimately on us.</p><p> In fact, in order to effectively communicate to all prospects, we in sales and marketing need to find ways to understand the individual behavioral styles of the people we are targeting. This is important when you want to establish rapport and build trust. Preferred communication styles are key to building a successful business relationship, whether the person is 20 years old, or 80.</p><p> <strong>  Not everybody responds to the same communication tools </strong> <br/> In our family we have this challenge all the time. My children are adults and spread out all over the country. We always struggle with finding the best means to ensure everybody &ldquo;hears\" the message. My older son still responds to email, but prefers text. My younger son only responds to text messages. My husband prefers in-person conversations (almost impossible these days) and I try to be as flexible as I can to keep everybody engaged. </p><p> While this can be exhausting and frustrating in a family setting, in a business environment it can cost us money. Not being heard means that our message doesn't come through and that ultimately could result in lost opportunities. </p><p> <strong>  But how can we assure that our messages are heard? </strong> <br/> Learn the different behavioral styles <br/> My company offers a training approach where learners can identify the preferred communications style of individuals, as well as discovering behavioral styles. Understanding the four basic behavioral styles (DISC) helps our clients identify their own behavioral style preference through a web-based self-assessment and the behavioral styles of others <br/> <br/> Below is a description of the four different styles. Keep in mind that we all are probably a combination, with one dominant style.  <br/>   <br/> <strong>  D &ndash; Dominance = Director   </strong></p><li> Fast-paced, cuts to the chase, gets to the point</li><li> Stresses results, accomplishments and innovation </li><li> Quick to make decisions and make an idea their own  <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Motto:  Just Do It!  </strong></p><p> <strong>   I &ndash; Influence = Expressive  </strong></p><li> Fast-paced and socially striving</li><li> Considers how the decision will make them look </li><li> Quick to make decisions and follow-up on their commitment <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Motto: Life&rsquo;s Too Short &ndash; Have Some Fun!  </strong></p><p> <strong>   S &ndash; Steadiness   </strong></p><li> Reserved, friendly, neighborly, soft-spoken</li><li> Stresses reliability, dependability, likes assurances and warranties </li><li> Slower to make decisions, likes to hear testimonials  <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Motto: Two Heads Are Better Than One! </strong></p><p> <strong>  C &ndash; Conscientiousness/Critical = Analytical   </strong></p><li> Reserved, analytical, calculating</li><li> Stresses value, proof, facts and figures </li><li> Slower to make decisions, likes to quantify  <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Motto: If You Are Going to Do It &ndash; Do It Right </strong></p><p> <strong>  Adjust your sales approach </strong> <br/> <br/> Once you can identify how behavioral traits relate to buying styles you can appropriately adjust your approach based on your prospect's behavioral style. By doing so, you build trust and gain commitments. You will then be able to appreciate and adjust to the strengths and weaknesses inherent to each style and plan for effective interactions.</p><p> Understanding different behavioral types keeps you from misreading the intention and motivation of others and will help you navigate easier. You also will be able to better prepare for presentations because you will know what the client needs to hear about your product, company and you before agreeing to buy. <br/> <br/> For example, people who are director types (like myself), want you to get to the point quickly, cut out the fluff and explain clearly. If you are dealing with somebody who is a strong analytical type, you will want to have your facts straight and be prepared to go into as much detail as needed. This allows the analytical person to process the information and feel confident they did their due diligence. Strategically adjusting your approach will help you gain trust and acceptance of others with integrity and honesty. <br/>   </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 19:12:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 19:12:40.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_dfg3Tle.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/selling-to-people-different-than-you-its-all-about-style/\", \"post_id\": \"5566\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 19:12:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 19:12:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"selling-to-people-different-than-you-its-all-about-style\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5565\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2524\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439554042724-0830ea60b8ff-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"609\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440070200,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}

That&rsquo;s a whole lot of frustrated ranting going on. Look, I get it. In most companies, if you&rsquo;re serious about your project, you can&rsquo;t show up to a meeting without a &ldquo;deck&rdquo; to explain it. But if people are glazing over, you&rsquo;re not inspiring their best thinking.</p><p> Shortly after returning to Apple Steve Jobs said:</p><p> I hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking. People confront a problem by creating a presentation. I wanted them to engage, to hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they&rsquo;re talking about don&rsquo;t need PowerPoint.</p><p> For most of us that&rsquo;s a nontroversy. But the Powerpoint requirement is still the norm. So for goodness sake, do us a favor and follow these 9 tips.</p><h3> 9 Ways to Improve Your Powerpoint Presentation</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Start With Your Message</h3><p> What do you want your audience TO DO as a result of your presentation? I&rsquo;m always amazed at how fuzzy that often is. Don&rsquo;t start with the deck, start with your message. Outline your talk track BEFORE working on the slides. Your slides are gravy, not the meat.</p><h3> 2. Simplify Your Text</h3><p> Keep to the rule of one point per slide and make your point pop. Reinforce it with a 5-7 word call out box.</p><h3> 3. Use Clean Fonts</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t use more than three fonts. If you have to reduce font size to less than 24pt, you&rsquo;re cramming too much in.</p><h3> 4. Let Your Headings Tell a Story</h3><p> Go through the presentation and just read the headings. If your headings don&rsquo;t tell a coherent story on their own, revise them.</p><h3> 5. Use Your Layout to Focus Attention</h3><p> The most important places to put information are the heading, upper left side and the bottom.</p><h3> 6. Build a Model</h3><p> Models go a low way in simplifying complex messages. Think  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=food+pyramid&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=TASJRsK9hu2AEM%253A%253BN8CFiyvHiSoRpM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.disabled-world.com%25252Fartman%25252Fpublish%25252Ffood_pyramid.shtml&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=TASJRsK9hu2AEM%253A%252CN8CFiyvHiSoRpM%252C_&amp;dpr=1&amp;usg=__UGIiyLe9PfhB4ZhZ_z5vaGxcpQU%3D&amp;ved=0CCkQyjdqFQoTCNLZgKjYpscCFQxZPgod-E0Jfw&amp;ei=GeLMVZLpGIyy-QH4m6X4Bw#imgrc=TASJRsK9hu2AEM%3A&amp;usg=__UGIiyLe9PfhB4ZhZ_z5vaGxcpQU%3D\" target=\"_blank\">   food pyramid  </a> </u>  or Sinek&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=simon+sinek+golden+circle&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMIhdeW0NimxwIVCnA-Ch3_WQ6E#imgrc=JhjL7pzgzIi8nM%3A\" target=\"_blank\">   Golden Circle  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 7. Use Compelling Visuals</h3><p> DO NOT use clip art. Instead find clean photographs that tell your story. If the image doesn&rsquo;t enhance the meaning leave it out. If you present frequently, look for unique pictures as you&rsquo;re out in the world, capture them with your phone and save them in a folder.</p><h3> 8. End with a Call to Action</h3><p> Ask your audience for what you need or want them to do.</p><h3> 9. Create a Separate Leave Behind</h3><p> One of the main reasons Powerpoints are so crammed full of words and data is that they&rsquo;re created to be &ldquo;cascaded&rdquo; and shared by someone other than the presenter. If you want to capture your primary audience&rsquo;s attention, build a few slides that truly support your main ideas. Then create a separate document with additional detail and supporting data.</p><p> Differentiate your message with clean slides that enhance your story, and your audience will have more energy left to engage and do what you need them to do.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 19:06:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 19:06:00.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_qqdzEK8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/9-ways-to-improve-your-powerpoint-presentations/\", \"post_id\": \"5564\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 19:06:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 19:06:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"9-ways-to-improve-your-powerpoint-presentations\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5563\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2523\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blogImage-06-12-14_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"649\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440098100,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}

It is surprising how many organizations have dedicated significant time and energy to developing and solidifying company values but then fail to integrate them into the employee work culture.</p><p> These three steps will help you bring your company&rsquo;s values to the forefront and keep your employees on board.</p><h3> #1. Communicate Them</h3><p> <br/> Communication of your core values is important both within the leadership and publicly among all employees. Leaders must have an unshakable commitment to organizational congruity and be able to transmit that to others. A survey by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_US/us/About/Leadership/1fe8be4ad25e7310VgnVCM1000001956f00aRCRD.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Deloitte  </a> </u>  has found that 70% of the employees who agreed that their companies had performed well financially said their executive management team speaks to them often about the core aspects of the company&rsquo;s culture.</p><p> Talk about your organization&rsquo;s values often. Include them in meetings, emails, and employee training programs. Especially when conveying company culture to new hires, tell the story of your company and it developed, and outline concrete examples of engagement with its core principles.</p><p> Showcase your values. Hang them on the wall in the breakroom if you need to. A study by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.recognizethisblog.com/index.php/2012/12/fall-2012-workforce-mood-tracker-recognition-linked-to-core-values-delivers-increased-roi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Globoforce  </a> </u>  shows:</p><li> <p>  88% of employees who are well versed in company values say they are engaged  </p></li><li> <p>  54% of employees who don&rsquo;t know their company&rsquo;s values say they are engaged  </p></li><h3> 2. Recognize Them in Action</h3><p> <br/> Acknowledge those who are living up to company standards with tangible rewards and public recognition. This will motivate employees and give them further incentives to consider values when making important decisions.</p><p> During performance reviews, coach employees on how to better embody core principles and remind them of incentives, promotions, etc. Be open with those who are not acting in accordance with core values and offer suggestions for improvement. Recruit and hire people whose values are naturally aligned with company culture.</p><h3> 3. Revisit Them</h3><p> <br/> Leadership is responsible for defining values and keeping them at the forefront of the company. Before expecting individual employees to act accordingly, you must ask yourself: </p><li> <p>  Is the organization at large moving in the direction of its values?  </p></li><li> <p>  Is the leadership encouraging the right kind of growth? </p></li><li> <p>  Are the organization&rsquo;s tenants held in account when considering new business prospects or new hires? </p></li><p> If the answer to any of those questions is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; or &ldquo;not sure,&rdquo; take time to revisit your values and, if necessary, restructure your company in ways that will better focus on carrying out them out OR rework them to better reflect the company&rsquo;s current vision.</p><p> Ask employees how they feel about the company&rsquo;s direction: </p><li> <p>  Do they feel that core values are being engaged?  </p></li><li> <p>  If not, what improvements do they envision? </p></li><li> <p>  How do they feel values could be better integrated into their individual positions? </p></li><p> Though the ideas at the heart of an organization can sometimes seem like nothing more than a clever slogan or mantra, they are key to any successful venture. By learning to communicate values effectively and consistently, you will contribute to a stable and happy workforce which encourages growth in the right direction.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 18:57:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 18:57:45.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_zdBAQRj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-ways-to-bring-employees-on-board-with-your-company-values/\", \"post_id\": \"5562\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 18:57:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 18:57:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-ways-to-bring-employees-on-board-with-your-company-values\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5561\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2522\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/plane-boarding-1.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"477\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440090900,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2466,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Developing Healthy Habits in Your Organization","link":"developing-healthy-habits-in-your-organization","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;The difference between an amateur and a professional is in their habits. An amateur has amateur habits. A professional has professional habits. We can never free ourselves from habit. But we can replace bad habits with good ones.&rdquo; &mdash;Steven Pressfield</p><h3> Why Develop Healthy Habits?</h3><p> <br/> Do you want your organization to play the role of amateur or the role of professional? Bertrand Russell explained, &ldquo;Right discipline consists, not in external compulsion, but in the habits of mind which lead spontaneously to desirable rather than undesirable activities.&rdquo; Habits give your brain a rest by putting some things on autopilot. Why not develop the habits within your organization that lead to right decisions and action on an almost unconscious level?</p><p> When you develop a habit, you create a connection between a specific situation and a resulting action. Why not make it easier for your employees and management to do the right things and make good decisions and harder to do the wrong things? Because habits become instinct, they eliminate the tendency to over think. Your values drive your culture and set the priorities that provide a framework for decisions and actions. Why not use habits as a tool for achieving the behavior you want within your organization?</p><h3> Consistency</h3><p> <br/> Stephen Covey explained, &ldquo;Our character is basically a composite of our habits. Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character.&rdquo; What character has your organization developed? When you develop healthy habits throughout your organization, you improve consistency in your behaviors. These healthy habits improve the character and reputation of your organization. The consistency created by the habits you develop makes it much easier to predict where you are going and how you will get there.</p><p> When you develop a positive culture, your employees love what they do, they love their clients, and they work together toward the same, shared vision. With healthy organizational habits you can empower your employees to act, knowing their actions and decisions will be consistent with the vision of the organization. The consistency which results from these habits increases the ability to accelerate problem solving and decision-making. Use habits to establish consistent core principles that reinforce organizational knowledge and clarify beliefs. This will allow you to streamline your business operations. Make sure your culture and habits mirror your mission and cultivate strength in your core beliefs.</p><h3> Free up energy</h3><p> <br/> Ralph W. Sockman said, &ldquo;Good habits, which bring our lower passions and appetites under automatic control, leave our natures free to explore the larger experiences of life. Too many of us divide and dissipate our energies in debating actions which should be taken for granted.&rdquo; How much energy can you free up in your organization by developing healthy habits? When your employees have healthy habits to operate by it frees up energy to be put towards their passion and gives life to creativity and innovation. Use the extra energy to ask the silly questions and perform the crazy experiments that may lead to incredible break-throughs.</p><p> Increase energy by developing and nurturing a culture and habits where employees are trained, equipped, and encouraged to think for themselves. When you instill good habits in your organization you can feel confident allowing employees the leeway to explore new ideas and expand thinking. Make sure the healthy habits you develop are all inclusive where everyone feels they are part of the greater whole. Use your extra energy to rally your people around a big idea but leave space for inspiration and the opportunity to think differently. Use habits to create a culture of gratitude where employees are energized and excited about the work they do.</p><h3> How Do We Do It?</h3><p> <br/> Culture is a deeply held and widely shared set of beliefs, norms, and assumptions that work together to make specific behaviors and outcomes more likely. Organizational culture starts with shared beliefs which influence the habits employees develop. These habits will play a big role in how employees think and act. The habits you develop should be clearly based on what you believe since they will be the foundation for behaviors, actions, and decision-making.</p><p> Culture has to be continually managed, refreshed, and refocused to maintain healthy habits. Success is no longer guaranteed by just attracting the best people and investing in innovative ideas; your culture must emphasize and reward healthy habits. Promote a positive and opportunity focused attitude at all levels of the organization. Develop habits that inspire people, focus them on a shared mission, and give them a sense of purpose. With the right support and habits, your people will be willing to move mountains to achieve a shared vision.</p><h3> The process</h3><p> <br/> As A. P. J. Abdul Kalam explained, &ldquo;Excellence is a continuous process and not an accident.&rdquo; If you want to develop healthy habits in your organization, you will have to devote conscious effort to it. In his book The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg lists the three step process that plays into the phenomena of human habits. First, there is a prompt that triggers a specific behavior. Second, there is a behavior routine that is triggered. And third, there is a psychological reward for performing the behavior.</p><p> If you want to change habits you must introduce a different routine. You must first identify the prompts that lead to the unwanted behaviors. Then, discover which rewards are associated with those behaviors. Finally, you can implement alternative routines which offer similar rewards. While the process listed here is generic, it applies to all habits. If you look closely, you will see it at work in your organization. With a little planning, you can use this process to your advantage in developing the healthy habits that bring about the desired behaviors in your organization.</p><h3> Behaviors</h3><p> <br/> Margaret Mead said, &ldquo;Our humanity rests upon a series of learned behaviors, woven together into patterns that are infinitely fragile and never directly inherited.&rdquo; The actions and decisions of your employees within the boundaries of your organization are based on the behaviors they have learned over time. These behaviors create patterns of action, which represent habits, in your organization and must be deliberately created if you want any influence over the behaviors and actions of your employees.</p><p> Design a culture that develops habits which are aligned with team, organizational, and individual values so that behaviors are predictable and consistent. Develop a shared meaning for success to ensure all decisions and actions are directed towards the same goal. Create a supportive environment where both individuals and the organization benefit. Once you have the right values and habits in place you can rally employees around a shared sense of purpose and mission. To get the behaviors you are seeking, develop habits that put your people before your strategy. Listen to the voice of your employees, build your team, play to their strengths, and then learn to get out of the way and let them run with it.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t approach the development of healthy habits by asking yourself how you can repair what you&rsquo;re doing wrong. Instead, start asking yourself how you can build on what you&rsquo;re already doing right. Take a long-term perspective to identifying the habits that will serve your organization best. Trust that your healthy habits will turn obstacles into opportunities to innovate and grow. Use your culture and organizational habits as tools to reinforce skills and clarify knowledge. Habits are based on action not just words, so lead by example. Remember to celebrate the little successes. If you want to transform your organization, you must set your sights on a higher purpose and place a priority focusing on the health of the habits in your organization.</p><h3> What Habits Will You Choose?</h3><p> <br/> Benjamin Franklin explained, &ldquo;Your net worth to the world is usually determined by what remains after your bad habits are subtracted from your good ones.&rdquo; Do the healthy habits in your organization outweigh the bad? If you want to get new behavior from your employees you must change their habits. What beliefs and habits will produce the behaviors that will cause your organization to thrive?</p><p> Cultivate a culture that allows employees to play an important role in something big and meaningful. Then, develop the healthy habits that will produce the desired decisions and actions. Brian Tracy said, &ldquo;Successful people are simply those with successful habits.&rdquo; What habits will you choose?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 18:57:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 18:57:01.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_TgReOD0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/developing-healthy-habits-in-your-organization/\", \"post_id\": \"5560\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 18:57:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 18:57:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"developing-healthy-habits-in-your-organization\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5559\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2521\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-19-at-12.03.17-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"473\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440187200,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2465,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Envy at Work: Why It Feels So Good To See Someone Else Fail","link":"envy-at-work-why-it-feels-so-good-to-see-someone-else-fail","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I once had a boss I really disliked. After leaving the organization, I learned that he got demoted after a major mistake. As a shiver of delight worked its way up my spine I consciously fought the urge to smile as my colleague, who liked the guy, shared the news. The difficult-to-translate German word  schadenfreude , combining  schaden  (damage) and  freude  (joy), describes a universal human emotion: taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. It&rsquo;s what keeps us glued to reality TV and those star bashing magazines, with the endless, fabulous mess-ups of the Snookies or Kardashians of the world.</p><p> Schadenfreude stems from our human tendency for comparison.  In our society, where conventional and social media have spawned a multitude of arenas for people to compare themselves with one another, schadenfreude abounds. Those who may have made us feel puny by comparison (think domestic diva Martha Stewart) make us feel pretty darned good about ourselves when they fall from grace.</p><p> Before you accuse yourself of heartless insensitivity when you feel that little shiver of delight, remind yourself that every person feels it from time to time. Feeling envy toward someone or someone&rsquo;s life is as normal as feeling simple happiness or contentment. Unlike those positive emotions, however, it can change into something ugly, especially when it becomes envy.</p><p> Envy occurs when we wish we possessed another person&rsquo;s attributes, achievement or possessions or wish they did not have them. Although a natural human feeling, envy can cause some serious suffering when we compare ourselves to people nearby and find ourselves on the short end of the stick because it:</p><li> Highlights what others possess</li><li> Reminds you what you lack</li><li> Triggers unpleasant or destructive behaviors</li><li> Can interfere with successful, productive work relationships</li><li> Makes you feel ashamed</li><p> <br/> Envy can also violate an equally powerful desire to see oneself in a positive light, as a good person who supports others and enjoys their successes, as opposed to a bad person who harbors envious or malicious thoughts about someone else&rsquo;s achievements. The resulting cognitive dissonance (holding two conflicting ideas simultaneously) can create some difficult emotions to deal with. Envy also triggers that part of our brain that deals with conflict, emotional pain and rejection, experiences we all find unpleasant. The pain prompts some nasty behavioral responses that can undermine or even ruin trust, team cohesion, interpersonal relations and the general health of an organization&rsquo;s culture.</p><p> So what do you do when these very natural feelings begin gnawing away at your self-esteem, self-worth, and self-image?  First, remember that emotions are not good or bad, they only become problematic when left unmanaged. Second, admit to yourself (or a trusted advisor) that it&rsquo;s happening and that your ego has been bruised. Then pay attention to the tactics you are using to protect yourself by taking personal inventory. Have you been playing the victim role? Have you been acting like a gossipy teenager? Have you been backstabbing or sabotaging the target of your envy? Once you have gained a little insight into your feelings/behaviors, you can begin to dissect the problem by:</p><li> Pinpointing the cause of your schadenfreude or envy and the events that led to these feelings.</li><li> Describing your expected outcome before you felt these emotions.</li><li> Identifying the people (intended and unintended) who might suffer from your actions.</li><li> Considering advice you would give to a friend about coping with similar emotions, thoughts and behaviors.</li><li> Identifying one or two steps you can take right now to rise above your circumstances, take ownership of your situation, and achieve your desired results.</li><p> <br/> Even though it may be humbling to admit your feelings, left unmanaged they can get pretty nasty. Talking through these steps provides some of the psychological distance we need in order to regain perspective.  Nothing cures a bad case of envy like a healthy dose of reality and some perspective taking.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 18:54:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 18:54:30.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_b12V4cz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/envy-at-work-why-it-feels-so-good-to-see-someone-else-fail/\", \"post_id\": \"5558\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 18:54:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 18:54:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"envy-at-work-why-it-feels-so-good-to-see-someone-else-fail\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5557\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2520\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shutterstock_envy-620x250.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"828\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440090000,"author_id":156,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2464,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The ‘Seven Deadly Sins' Committed by Workers","link":"the-seven-deadly-sins-committed-by-workers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A colleague told me that she had to fire one of her employees because he hadn&rsquo;t shown any initiative in her fast-paced, creative work environment. I thought for a second and responded that he had committed one of the Workers&rsquo; Seven Deadly Sins &ndash; the work traits that cause employees to be ignored, not promoted, or even fired.In today&rsquo;s workplace, you want to be seen as a valuable and vital employee. You want to become someone with whom others want to work.Ask yourself if you exhibit any of the following traits, and resolve to eliminate them if you do. <strong>  1. Not showing initiative. </strong>  Do you try new and possibly better ways to accomplish your work? Be proactive. Is your employer gaining anything extra from you? As my colleague&rsquo;s employee found out, most employers want you to go above and beyond the basic requirements. <strong>  2. Not paying attention to details. </strong>  Are there mistakes in your work? Do you notice the little things, proofread your writings, and double-check any numbers? There can be consequences if you don&rsquo;t. One engineer wrote the wrong house number on a work order, and his employees ripped up the wrong driveway. <strong>  3. Not conveying enthusiasm for your job. </strong>  Show interest in your work. Be eager to get the job done. Arrive on time, or early. Stay late when necessary. Avoid downbeat topics and stop complaining. Don&rsquo;t criticize your employer, boss or co-workers on your social-media sites. If you are unhappy with your position, take action to change it &ndash; whether by talking to your boss, moving to a different department, or taking a position with a different company. The job market has improved, and according to a recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jobless-recovery-is-now-the-job-led-recovery-2015-03-01?dist=beforebell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MarketWatch  </a> </u>  article, job openings are at a 14-year high. <strong>  4. Not staying current with changes in your profession.  </strong> You don&rsquo;t want to be left behind. Continue learning. Stay abreast of any trends in your field. Take advantage of any training your company offers. Stay up-to-date with technology, including social media. <strong>  5. Not offering to help. </strong>  You need to do your work, but whenever possible you also should offer to help others. You come across as a team player when you do &ndash; somebody others want to work with. Plus, you learn new skills and meet new people. Added benefits! <strong>  6. Not having a professional demeanor. </strong>  You want to convey a confident and credible image. Be aware of your verbal and nonverbal communication. Are you speaking too softly or too loudly? Are you dressing appropriately for your position? Do you use filler words (&ldquo;okay,&rdquo; &ldquo;all right,&rdquo; &ldquo;like&rdquo;) that take away from your comments? Additional information on professional presence can be found in my book,  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071811265/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0071811265&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pachasso-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Essentials of Business Etiquette: How to Greet, Eat and Tweet Your Way to Success  </u>  .  </a> <strong>  7. Not connecting with others. </strong>  People don&rsquo;t like to work with colleagues who ignore them. Be friendly. Smile.

After all, isn&rsquo;t that why someone would choose us and our business over someone else &ndash; because we&rsquo;re the better business? However, this method is not always effective.</p><p> For instance, if someone asks why they should do business with you as opposed to the firm across the street &ndash; you begin to give them your list of &ldquo;betters.&rdquo; You may not say it by using the word better, but it sounds like you have&hellip; better communication, better services, better products, better affiliates that you work with, etc. And the problem with inferring &ldquo;better&rdquo; is that the consumer doesn&rsquo;t believe it. We don&rsquo;t believe that something will actually be better!</p><p> Think of yourself going to the grocery store and heading down the laundry detergent aisle. If you see a jug of Tide detergent with a big &ldquo;NEW AND IMPROVED&rdquo; on it, do you immediately buy it because you are sure that now, finally, your clothes will get cleaner? No, of course not! We don&rsquo;t actually believe it will be that much better. And it&rsquo;s risky buying a different laundry detergent (certainly not as risky as switching financial advisors &ndash; ah, but you get the point). So how can you communicate that you&rsquo;re the best choice without pointing out how you do things better than others?</p><p> What we need to be is different. If we can, we need to share what is truly unique about what we do &ndash; not compare ourselves to others. So, what is unique about you? I would say that there is one thing unique about your firm, and it&rsquo;s the people inside. The founder, lead advisor, portfolio manager, and staff make the company truly unique. These people can&rsquo;t be acquired somewhere else. And, 80% of the reason someone chooses your firm is because of you &ndash; not your products.

If you are currently enjoying good health (and long may that continue), it can be difficult to picture the situation changing. In some cases, future health issues that you will encounter will be relatively minor ones. In other situations, you or a loved one will be faced with living with a chronic illness or the sudden trauma of an accident. Since Canadians can now look forward to living longer in retirement than previous generations, you need to be aware of the 5 stages of long term care which can have an impact on retirement planning.</p><h3> 5 Stages of Long Term Care</h3><h3> <br/> Stage 1: Independence</h3><p> This is the stage which all of us hope will last the longest. During this time, you are self-sufficient and able to manage any of your health concerns, including those associated with chronic illness or disability, on your own without help from either your family or paid caregivers.</p><h3> Stage 2: Interdependence</h3><p> During the interdependence stage, health issues will start to interfere with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, toileting, etc.). You will start to need help from family members for things like grocery shopping, cooking, banking, and housekeeping, but will not need to hire people to help you with these tasks yet. At this point, your family may start looking at a senior&rsquo;s residence where you would have access to amenities such as a private suite, on-site security, laundry facilities, cleaning services, and a meal plan.</p><h3> Stage 3: Supportive Living</h3><p> In the third stage of long term care, you have started to become more dependent on others for practical things like meal preparation, shopping, transportation, and cleaning. You may need some limited help with bathing, dressing, and grooming.</p><p> You will likely be getting help from family members and some formal services from home care providers or adult day care centers. At this stage, you may be living in an assisted living facility or a retirement residence. Your choices will depend on your finances; government subsidies for elder care are very limited.</p><h3> Stage 4: Crisis Management</h3><p> At this point, you are dependent on others but you may still be able to receive care in your own home. Family members will 0have started to burn out at this stage from the demands of looking after your multiple health and personal care needs. Formal home care may not be sufficient to meet your needs or it may simply be too expensive for your budget.</p><h3> Stage 5: Dependence</h3><p> By the time you reach this stage, your needs will need to be met by nursing and personal care staff at a long-term care facility. Family members have become overwhelmed and exhausted from trying to meet your care requirements. You may need constant supervision for your own safety as well.</p><p> We all hope for a long and healthy retirement but if we are not financially prepared for longevity, we may outlive our money. With proper planning though, we can have peace of mind about the quality of retirement we can afford and ensure that we have enough money to pay for the health care we may eventually need.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 18:41:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 18:41:09.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_M3j8ds2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-stages-of-long-term-care-you-need-to-know-about/\", \"post_id\": \"5552\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 18:41:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 18:41:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-stages-of-long-term-care-you-need-to-know-about\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5551\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2517\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AsssistedLiving.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"737\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440079200,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}

The customer's needs, jobs, and perspectives do not play a part in this type of thinking; they aren't taken into consideration. You make decisions because you think it's what's best for the business - not for customers. Or you think you know what's best for customers. <br/> <br/> On the other hand,  <strong>  outside-in thinking </strong>  means that you look at your business from the customer's perspective and subsequently design processes, tools, and products and make decisions based on what's best for the customer and what meets the customer's needs. You make decisions because you know it's what's best for your customers. Why? Because you listen to them, and you understand them and the jobs they are trying to do. <br/> <br/> It might be  <strong>  inside-out thinking </strong>  when there's a conscious decision to make process, policy, people, systems, or other changes that:</p><li> Don't improve the customer experience at the same time</li><li> Are about maximizing shareholder returns, not about benefits for the customer</li><li> Improve internal efficiencies but to the detriment of customer interactions</li><li> Are cost-cutting measures that also negatively impact the  customer experience</li><li> Might be the wrong process, policy, people, or systems to change <br/>  </li><p> By contrast,  <strong>  outside-in thinking </strong>  flips each of those points on its head and looks like this.

{"original_id":2460,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do You Pick Sameness or Yourself?","link":"do-you-pick-sameness-or-yourself","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  We go through life being conditioned to how life is supposed to be and what is expected from us to have a great life. </strong> And yet no one shares with us the secret that no one else knows what we need. How could they? Do they take time to get to know us and really know what is in our heart? And the irony is that most of us can easily give someone else advice and yet, we don't take the time to get to know ourselves.</p><h3> There is constant judgement around us. There is a constant push to sameness.</h3><p> <br/> I went to a party recently where the hostess took a look at me and validated that I made the \"right\" decisions with what I wore to her gathering of women. In the past, I never would have noticed it but as I continue to go on my path of un-conditioning, I am awake and aware. So when she said: \"Your blue top matches your eyes and I love those purple toes with the cool sandals,\" I accepted the compliment and it made me think.</p><p> Whew, I passed or did I? I dress now for comfort and what makes me happy. I no longer need the trendiest items because it is no longer about fitting in. For me, it's about being able to show up as who I am and connect with likeminded souls who want to make the world a fabulous experience for everyone.</p><p> Somehow we have been conditioned by checklists and deadlines. And that worked 200 years ago when our average life span was 40. It was easy to tick items off a checklist when the clock was ticking quickly. It made sense to ask people what would they really do with their life if they had 3-6 months to live and have a bucket list.</p><p> Today, more of us are waking up as we are living longer. We have ticked items off our checklist and are asking, \"what's next?\" and \"this is it?\" We need to be asking ourselves, what would we do if we had 100+ years to live. And life includes work. We don't need to put our lives on hold with bucket lists of doing something one day and slowly crossing it off. What if our lives could be our bucket list? What if we knew what we wanted and told ourselves we can figure out how to make it happen?</p><h3> Our society conditions us to sameness.</h3><p> <br/> The dreaded bell curve forced us to fit in and show how well we are doing compared to others. The bell curve is dead, but many of us missed that newsflash. The opportunities today are on the edge because we can connect easily with other people through online networks and word of mouth. Anything is possible for us if we divorce ourselves from our culture of sameness and decided to shine our own light.</p><p> In my work with individuals and organizations, we work on how to unravel our deepest desires of what and who we want to be in the world, starting with our why, our purpose. It is not an easy road but it's about shifting the story we tell ourselves and the one we tell others.

The data gleaned from business intelligence can be invaluable and transform how decisions are made in the workplace.</p><p> But if business intelligence is so valuable, why has its adoption rate  <u>  <a href=\"http://tdwi.org/Articles/2013/01/29/Pervasive-BI-Still-Elusive.aspx?Page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   barely increased since 2005  </a> </u> ? Is there some unseen problem with the data that business intelligence brings in?</p><p> The problem doesn&rsquo;t lie with business intelligence itself, but rather with how it&rsquo;s presented to employees. Too often, the valuable data it yields just sits there unparsed and passive while people go about their daily business, ignoring potentially valuable data for more pressing concerns. People just aren&rsquo;t engaged in what the data has to offer.</p><p> But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way. Company leaders should take the initiative to actively engage their employees when it comes to business intelligence so they can make the most out of the collected data.</p><h3> Cut Through the Mound of Data</h3><p> <br/> The information your company gets from data collection is great, but not all of it is relevant to every one of your employees. Trying to parse through a pile of irrelevant data can overwhelm users and discourage them from even making the attempt.</p><p> Leaders need to take an active role in delivering relevant data to each department rather than handing employees everything and asking them to figure it out. Big data should work for your employees, not create more work for them.</p><p> The sales team, for instance, should be alerted to any critical changes in the pipeline so it can make proper adjustments in its quarterly strategy. All departments should have hidden outliers, such as flagging products or anomalous behavior, at the top of the data pile so they can act on them without having to search for them.</p><h3> Be Active, not Passive</h3><p> <br/> One of the major problems when it comes to increasing engagement with business intelligence is that its present-day benefit isn&rsquo;t always clear. It&rsquo;s great for measuring past performance and identifying future trends, but for employees who are focused on the day-to-day, these aren&rsquo;t usually top priorities.</p><p> As a result, employees are less inclined to check out reports and analytics dashboards on their own time, choosing to focus on more pressing matters instead. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to implement active alerts for these employees so they can be notified when the data reveals unusual events or relevant statistics.</p><p> By directly sending employees digests of results instead of waiting for them to seek out the information, you can increase engagement and showcase the value business intelligence brings to the table in one fell swoop.</p><h3> Keep It Collaborative</h3><p> <br/> Another issue with creating engagement with big data is that context is often lost in the numbers. If people aren&rsquo;t discussing what they see, there&rsquo;s a good chance they don&rsquo;t have a full understanding of the data in front of them.</p><p> Discussions between employees and departments at the data-point level should be encouraged so that when alerts are sent out, users can add context that can help explain the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of big data.</p><h3> Engage Yourself</h3><p> <br/> Engagement is a two-way street. If employees are supposed to be looking at business intelligence data on a regular basis, then leaders need to do the same.</p><p> Company leadership should ask questions and spark discussions around the latest data, encouraging a results-centric dialogue among departments. Business intelligence should become an active part of the culture instead of just a set of numbers on the sidelines.</p><h3> Use Affinity and Social Proof</h3><p> <br/> Oftentimes, employees simply don&rsquo;t know what metrics they should be following or which ones impact them.  <u>  <a href=\"http://businessintelligence.com/bi-insights/why-google-not-facebook-will-build-the-database-of-affinity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   An affinity database  </a> </u>  &mdash; or a record of users&rsquo; preferences collected by watching their social behaviors &mdash; can be used to engage them in metrics and discussions, which encourages involvement.</p><p> The affinity database is based on the notion that you can predict customer behavior by past actions, such as purchases. So look at what other similar users are interested in or what their peer groups are interested in, and make recommendations to users on which metrics are important in their world now. This will help teams laser-focus on specific metrics and increase their engagement.</p><p> Business intelligence can yield incredibly valuable information, but if not handled properly, it can also be incredibly overwhelming to many employees. By taking the right steps to engage your employees, your business can harness the full power of big data and create a more productive working environment.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 18:03:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 18:03:15.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_9CGGyQB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-ways-to-encourage-business-intelligence-engagement-in-your-employees/\", \"post_id\": \"5546\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 18:03:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 18:03:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-ways-to-encourage-business-intelligence-engagement-in-your-employees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5545\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2514\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-19-at-11.25.31-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"390\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440097200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2458,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Knowing Your Financial Metrics Can Increase Your Company's Value to Bprofi","link":"knowing-your-financial-metrics-can-increase-your-companys-value-to-bprofi","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Your P&amp;L says that you are making money &mdash; but, do you know precisely where that profit comes from? </strong>  More important, when a potential buyer asks you to explain the profit and how it can be grown, will you be able to answer these questions?</p><p> Understanding your company at this level of detail and being able to convey the information to buyers can make your company significantly more attractive to them, which will ultimately increase your company&rsquo;s value.</p><h3> What Questions Should You Be Able to Answer?</h3><p> <br/> While my middle-market clients usually know whether they make money, many of them don&rsquo;t have the systems in place to really understand what drives their profitability. Instead, many of these executives use intuition in place of data.</p><p> While the right questions to ask vary by company, middle-market executives often either don&rsquo;t know which ones to ask or ask the wrong ones.</p><p> Moneyball, the book by Michael Lewis that was later turned into a movie starring Brad Pitt, is often used as a lesson in this kind of analysis. Prior to Billy Beane joining the A&rsquo;s, traditional baseball management assessed players on the basis of whether they could run, throw, field, hit, and hit with power. Instead, the A&rsquo;s adopted a new series of questions that attempted to better predict whether a player would help the A&rsquo;s score runs, leading to more victories. This change in thinking brought significant success to the small-market A&rsquo;s.</p><p> In business, the question &ldquo;How do we generate revenue&rdquo; is often the obvious and simple question, but it falls short. Increasing revenue does not necessarily equate to increasing profitability, since not all revenue contributes equally to profit. Instead, a business owner might want to ask questions like:</p><p> <strong>  How much profit do we generate from each of our customers? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Which of our products generates the highest gross margin? </strong></p><p> <strong>  What is the gross margin on our individual projects? </strong></p><p> <strong>  What elements of our service contribute the greatest value to the company? </strong></p><h3> Buyers Are Metrics-Driven</h3><p> <br/> In my experience, one of the key differences between the middle-market companies that I represent and the financial and strategic acquirers that buy them is the buyers&rsquo; considerable ability to add financial and performance discipline to companies that may not have it.</p><p> Often, this is the simple result of experience. While MBAs abound throughout private equity firms and the M&amp;A departments of large corporations, many middle-market companies don&rsquo;t have the luxury of having spare financial expertise that can be diverted from the key tasks of making money.</p><p> My clients are often hugely surprised during a transaction when the buyers ask the company to split and parse their data in many ways that they don&rsquo;t (and, many times, didn&rsquo;t ever) think to do.</p><h3> Opportunities for Implementing Financial Metrics</h3><p> <br/> The good news is that in many cases, implementing some relatively simple metrics can be relatively straightforward. By adding them to the company&rsquo;s management reporting processes, the company can become more valuable to future buyers and make the company easier to manage.</p><h3> 1. Customer</h3><p> A great starting point for analysis is segregating the company&rsquo;s gross margin by customer. Often, companies don&rsquo;t adequately measure the costs associated with each individual customer, taking the easy way out by allocating hard-to-measure variable customer costs into easier-to-deal-with GS&amp;A buckets. Because in many cases the tools to do this sort of measurement aren&rsquo;t even available, analyzing profitability by customer often requires some degree of estimating.</p><h3> 2. Revenue Category</h3><p> Companies often provide products or services that vary in nature. For example, a company might provide different product types or sources or a blend of long-term and short-term services. Properly allocating the costs associated with these portfolios of products or services and tracking the profitability of each individual item allows a company to better determine where growth should occur.</p><h3> 3. Project:</h3><p> Project revenue is a particularly difficult area for companies that are engaged in it. Adequately tracking costs and revenue over time to provide the company with an accurate picture of the company&rsquo;s profitability is difficult. This analysis often first requires that the company establish an appropriate revenue recognition policy.</p><h3> 4. Salesperson:</h3><p> Finally, understanding profitability by sales staff is an obvious but often mismanaged effort when sales performance metrics are tied to numbers that aren&rsquo;t themselves good indicators of profitability. For example, quantifying a salesperson&rsquo;s sales to a particular customer only becomes useful if you understand the relative value those customers are providing to your company.</p><p> Rest assured that your buyers will do this analysis. I have been involved in more than a few transactions in which business owners were shocked at the analysis of their company&rsquo;s profitability that a buyer discovers when looking at the internal data.</p><p> While ultimately this is exactly the expertise and value-add you want from a buyer, your company will be much more attractive and valuable if you implement some very critical financial metrics in advance of any transaction.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 17:54:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 17:54:02.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_XA2Na9c.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/knowing-your-financial-metrics-can-increase-your-companys-value-to-bprofi/\", \"post_id\": \"5544\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 17:54:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 17:54:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"knowing-your-financial-metrics-can-increase-your-companys-value-to-bprofi\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5543\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2513\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-19-at-10.59.00-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1120\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440072000,"author_id":345,"chart_url":""}

They want advisors who are sincere and authentic. </strong></p><p> Authentic means &ldquo;trustworthy&rdquo; and nothing is more important when it comes to financial advice. But, many times we mean &lsquo;making investment decisions that are in the best interest of a client&rsquo;. For women, an authentic advisor is true to who and what he is as a person. If you can be honest about yourself, women can trust you with everything else, including doing the right thing on their behalf.</p><p> Sincere means being &ldquo;honest and open&rdquo; &ndash; not pretending to be something you are not.</p><h3> This is authenticity from the receiving end &ndash; the client&rsquo;s perspective.</h3><p> <br/> When women are looking for an advisor, they mean a partner where she has an important role to play in the relationship. It means you value her opinion and treat her with respect because that&rsquo;s who you are.</p><p> Women understand that sometimes there are screw-ups but the authentic advisor &lsquo;admits the error&rsquo; (doesn&rsquo;t blame staff). For women, it is less about the error and more about how it&rsquo;s handled once it&rsquo;s discovered.</p><p> Here are 3 discussions that show you are sincere and authentic and that will resonate with women (just make sure you act on all of them):</p><h3> 1. Open dialogue</h3><p> &ldquo;I will always speak my mind and expect you as my client to do the same &ndash; that means you have to tell me what&rsquo;s going on in your life so that I can do the best job for you. And if there&rsquo;s something that you don&rsquo;t understand or believe in, you must tell me. &ldquo;</p><h3> 2. Errors happen</h3><p> &ldquo;My clients are very important to me and I do everything I can to always do the right thing for each one. But I&rsquo;m not perfect and we&rsquo;ll likely make mistakes at some point. When we do, you&rsquo;ll hear directly from me and I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;re doing to make it right on your behalf. &ldquo;</p><h3> 3. Service levels</h3><p> &ldquo;If the service I provide isn&rsquo;t up to what you expect, I&rsquo;d like to hear from you about it, not as a result of your account being transferred out. I&rsquo;m a tough guy and I can take it. Just say, &lsquo;this service isn&rsquo;t working for me&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like us to meet more (or less) often&rsquo; or &lsquo;when you talk, I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying. Could you say in plain English&rsquo; or &lsquo;can we talk about other things at our meetings than rates of return and asset allocation&rsquo;. &ldquo;</p><p> Unfortunately, authenticity may be more challenging than perfection for some advisors.</p><h3> Take away</h3><p> <br/> Women want advisors who are authentic and sincere.

More and more, firms have adopted a team approach. This change in philosophy has transformed the way new employees are trained, developed and retained.</p><p> While there are clear benefits to teaming, the wrong approach can yield mixed results. Identifying and developing an employee&rsquo;s talents and strengths and helping them prosper are more important than forcing them to adapt to an existing system.</p><h3> A shift to training, mentorship</h3><p> <br/> Traditionally, the process of welcoming new employees to financial advisory firms as been far from ideal. Advisors, who were just starting out, after a little training, were often required to search for new business on their own. Not surprisingly, the failure rate was usually extremely high. Some wirehouse branch managers have suggested that using these kinds of onboarding tactics, less than 10% of new FAs lasted longer than two years.</p><h3> New methods</h3><p> <br/> Today, many firms are trying new methods of developing and retaining talent, utilizing a combination of training and mentorship. For example, some firms place new advisors with veterans as soon as they arrive. Under this arrangement, new associates can ask questions and learn strategies they can model in their own work. Veteran accounts often have a built-in network and a &ldquo;book of business&rdquo; that can be mined on smaller or less active accounts. This arrangement can also help new FAs learn to conduct effective client meetings and construct portfolios before moving to higher-level tasks over time.</p><p> The team model leads to a more collaborative environment. Clients like knowing that, besides their advisor, there are other professionals working on their behalf. In fact, some advisors of high net worth clients set meetings with every team member at a financial advisory firm as part of the client intake process. This way, the client can understand how each person will contribute to his or her experience.</p><h3> Things to remember <br/>  </h3><li> ​Different people have different strengths. Identifying and developing these strengths within individual contributors can unlock the potential of the larger group.</li><li> New team members and clients alike are embracing the mentorship model. The experience of working one-on-one with an industry veteran resonates with young professionals, while demonstrating to clients that a firm is taking a dynamic and holistic approach to their business. <br/>  </li><p> For more information on investment strategies and practice management, visit  <u>  durableportfolios.com </u></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 15:48:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 15:48:21.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_g5YHhR0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-building-teams-the-right-way/\", \"post_id\": \"5540\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 15:48:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 15:48:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-building-teams-the-right-way\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5539\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2511\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-19-at-10.03.45-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"523\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440089100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2455,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Identifying and Removing Obstacles","link":"identifying-and-removing-obstacles","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We all face numerous obstacles at work, large and small. When you have a team, additional problems can surface based on employee dynamics and pressures related to task performance, training, understanding and motivation.</p><p> As a business owner or manager, you want your team to be high performing, have high morale and be eager to participate. It&rsquo;s important that you pay attention to employee behavior and recognize when lack of sufficient communication and anger issues stemming from unfulfilled expectations or facing pressures, cause problems that can accelerate into large obstacles.</p><h3> An employee at your company can face obstacles in many ways.</h3><p> <br/> Understanding what these obstacles are can help you identify and remove them, leading to greater employee satisfaction and higher productivity.</p><h3> Step 1: Brainstorm all of the obstacles.</h3><p> Begin by brainstorming all possible obstacles. This can range from concerns such as not enough time; conflicting job priorities; lack of opportunity to apply training; peer pressure; disconnection from company culture; lack of self-confidence; lack of tools or resources to perform tasks well; lack of incentives to improve; and competitiveness within the workplace.</p><h3> Step 2: Categorize the obstacles into the following three categories: No Control, Influence and Direct Control.</h3><p> No Control obstacles are ones where the employee has literally no control over preventing or removing existing obstacles. This can range from infrastructure problems to management concerns. Influence obstacles are ones where the employee has influence over the outcome in varying degrees but they lie out of direct control or self-management. These also vary in their impact upon the employee with some resulting in greater impact such as pain or frustration. Finally, Direct Control obstacles are ones that the employee has direct control over such as his or her own behavior and taking the initiative to learn more and get training and support as needed.</p>No ControlInfluenceDirect ControlBe aware but ignore this listPrioritize by the greatest impactPrioritize by the easiest to address<h3> <br/> Step 3: Remove the obstacles where there is no control.</h3><p> It is very important that an employee understand what obstacles he or she has control over. Knowing this removes burdens and the feeling of being overwhelmed. It also releases any restrictions caused through inertia or paralysis that results from feeling overwhelmed or unable to perform.</p><h3> Step 4: Prioritize the &ldquo;Influence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Direct Control&rdquo; obstacles as shown above.</h3><p> Identifying what obstacles the employee then can influence and have direct control over is the next step. These obstacles need to be prioritized as well by importance and effect on the employee.</p><h3> Step 5: Develop an action plan for addressing the obstacles in these categories: who, what, when and how.</h3><p> Take the first obstacle in Step 4 and develop an action plan of how you will address each obstacle looking at it practically and identifying who, what, when and how.</p><h3> Step 6: Look back to step 4 for the next obstacle.</h3><p> Go through the same process with each major obstacle in the &ldquo;Influence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Direct Control&rdquo; categories and figure out an action plan to address each one. <br/> <br/> Doing this process is very helpful in getting clear on what obstacles your employees face and helping them become empowered to act in a healthy, productive way. It can prevent attrition and turnover while also boosting morale and team loyalty. You can also identify obstacles before they become insurmountable for your organization and improve your workplace so it becomes a place that employees love to be part of.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-19 15:19:25.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-19 15:19:25.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_0NqShrT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/identifying-and-removing-obstacles/\", \"post_id\": \"5538\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-19 15:19:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-19 15:19:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"identifying-and-removing-obstacles\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5537\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2510\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-19-at-8.29.39-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"466\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440190200,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2454,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Leaving a Legacy for Your Heirs by Writing One","link":"leaving-a-legacy-for-your-heirs-by-writing-one","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Most consider estate planning to be focused on ensuring that your assets are passed onto to your heirs based upon your wishes and not those of the government.</p><p> You work with a qualified and reputable estate-planning attorney to translate your wishes for property to be passed on at the time of your death into legally binding contracts, plans and wills. Many times this is done in conjunction with your financial advisor who can ensure the titling of accounts and trusts are structured based on these plans as well.</p><p> Thus when you're gone, your assets are dispersed based upon your wishes. But is that all that you'll leave behind? Will your possessions be the only legacy that you leave to your heirs and friends?</p><p> Of course not.</p><p> One of the most wonderful things that I've gathered from friends, family and others has been their stories and own personal histories that live on beyond their time here. Many times these are captured by audio and video recordings, or simply on the written page.</p><p> Alan Gelb,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.conquerthecollegeessay.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one of America's best writing coaches  </a> </u> , has written a book called \"Having the Last Say: Capturing Your Legacy in One Small Story\" that helps people to write a personal history that can be passed on to the next generation.</p><p> Gelb likens the capturing of this personal history to the Jewish tradition of an \"ethical will.\" &ldquo;A Jewish ethical will (in Hebrew, \"Zava&rsquo;ah\") is a document that is designed to pass ethical values from one generation to the next,&rdquo; Gelb points out.</p><p> However, Gelb feels that taking an approach, which he calls the \"last say,\" builds upon this tradition. He says, \"The primary purpose of a 'last say' is to help confer and gain perspective on the life that you have lived. The 'last say' provides a vehicle by which people can do this work in a way that's easy to understand and master. It retains the purpose of an ethical will, which is to pass ethical values from one generation to the next, but it looks to the narrative form to create a more engaging reading and listening experience.\"</p><p> It's in the creation of a narrative that Gelb has seen so many stumble and avoid creating their last say. Many people want to leave behind their stories and beliefs to exist as part of the family history that can be enjoyed and valued for years. But so many try to do this, and they struggle with writing it, and often their attempts to do this are left unfulfilled. The family is left with wonderful memories, but no written history.</p><p> Gelb outlines in his book how people can overcome the fear and anxieties of writing through his years as a leading writing coach. He provides the tools and keys to get people unstuck in their writing to help them to begin and complete the process of completing their last say.</p><p> When people have these tools and recognize the value that this will provide to other family members, Gelb finds that many people, who never consider themselves writers, can create a compelling narrative and \"last say\" that is a blessing for their entire family.</p><p> One day, we may see estate planners go beyond the financial aspects of transitioning just assets for people and provide the capabilities for people to include their last say as part of their overall estate plan. It will be more valuable than the assets that they pass on, and will probably last longer as well.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 19:30:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 19:30:17.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_7OvVnB5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/leaving-a-legacy-for-your-heirs-by-writing-one/\", \"post_id\": \"5536\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 19:30:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 19:30:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"leaving-a-legacy-for-your-heirs-by-writing-one\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5535\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2509\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MW-BP470_letter_20131119140853_MG.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"724\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440011700,"author_id":205,"chart_url":""}

Back then I remember having this VHS video to help me understand compensation. I wish I kept it to see how much the world has changed. Imagine you are sitting with a new prospective client and they ask&rdquo; how much does this cost&rdquo; and you hand them a video and a manual to explain how much it costs. Understand that compensation is all about proper disclosure, but having a simplified answer that is easy to understand and remember is critical in the trust building process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you have a scripted answer? Is it easy to understand and remember?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDo your clients understand and remember, or do they ask you again at progress update meetings how your fees work? Is it in dollar terms easily divisible into a monthly dollar cost? Or is it percentage and dollar terms, or only percentage terms?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I cannot remember the last time I purchased a major item such as a home or car or anything that is a percentage, which does not include dollar terms. A common mistake advisors make is not having a clear scripted answer to the question&rdquo; how much does it cost? &ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To test this point even further, many advisor do not record conversations they have with clients. If you want to have better conversations, record them with the client&rsquo;s permission. Then let a trusted colleague or coach help you by giving feedback. You cannot learn to play better golf by watching it. You must practice it. By practice, I mean by recording your conversations, playing them back then improving your conversation by having a clear, simple and compelling statement to answer the question &rdquo;how much does it cost?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listening to you answer the question &quot;how much does it cost,&quot; will help you become a better advisor. It will also help your clients see the trust and conviction when you have a simple, yet compelling answer to a very common question. I am not going to give you an answer here, because that is unique to each practice. Each practice may have different company requirements, cost structures, products and services. However, each practice must have a clear and simple, yet compelling answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is lots of simple recording software on your smartphone that you can use to record conversations. One app I found easy to use is Dragon Dictation by Nuance software www.nuance.com. To implement this idea, record three meetings with clients and prospects, then play it back and listen to your answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can you improve your answers and build more trust?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhat do you say when you talk about fees? If clients are 100% convinced and confident of your answer, then they should be handing over dozens of referrals to you. Do you have every client who works with you give all of their key contacts in their smartphone for you to talk to? That is the ultimate proof that they are confident of the value you bring to the table when you talk about cost.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 19:26:03.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 19:26:03.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_uxEVrLx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-do-you-answer-how-much-does-it-cost/\", \"post_id\": \"5534\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 19:26:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 19:26:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-do-you-answer-how-much-does-it-cost\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5533\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2508\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/how-much-does-a-website-cost.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1944\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":44763,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

The Right Audience</h3><p> <br/> The most important thing for a content marketer to remember is that good copy is not about the brand: it&rsquo;s about the consumer. As we discussed  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-appearance-everything-brands/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   in another recent post  </a> </u> , &ldquo;The real genius comes in reflecting those interests back to people through imagery, tone, words and design. Branding goes beyond a recitation of benefits to touch the heart and soul of what a consumer wants.&rdquo;</p><p> So how do you find this elusive target audience and market to their needs? Here&rsquo;s a few places to begin:</p><p> &ndash; Conduct surveys among existing customers.</p><p> &ndash; Invest in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-use-marketing-automation-generate-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CRM software  </a> </u>  that tracks customer relationships from prospecting through sales.</p><p> &ndash; Use Google Analytics to monitor your best and worst performing posts using Google Analytics.</p><p> &ndash; See what&rsquo;s trending on your Facebook Insights and Twitter Followers dashboards.</p><p> &ndash; Set up meetings with your sales and customer support teams to find out what issues they&rsquo;re encountering.</p><p> &ndash; Keep a pulse on what your top competitors are doing to determine voids and possible areas for improvement.</p><p> <img alt=\"the anatomy of content marketing infographic\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/anatomy-content.jpg\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  MarketerGizmo.com </u></p><h3> 5. A Distribution Network</h3><p> <br/> What distinguishes a good blog from a great blog is sometimes just a matter of exposure. You can write the most innovative posts all day long, but what good are your posts if no one can find them? Sharing and distribution are an equal slice of the content marketing pie. The average content marketer uses 13 different vehicles for content promotion, which includes everything from social media and video sharing sites, to PR Web and social bookmarking.  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/content-distribution-tools\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Check out 17 of the best content distribution vehicles here  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 6. A Vision of Value</h3><p> <br/> What problems are your readers looking to solve? What information do they need to know right now? What visuals do people enjoy looking at and sharing with their friends? These questions are all paramount to the savvy content marketer. We spend a lot of time digesting consumer trends, reading industry publications, skimming the headlines and honing our craft.</p><p> In our experience, the most valuable B2B content:</p><p> &ndash; Intrigues with facts, figures, links, images and infographics.</p><p> &ndash; Uses bold language, action words and tells a story.</p><p> &ndash; Harnesses a tone that is direct, friendly and professional.</p><p> &ndash; Answers key buyer quandaries: Why switch? Why act now? Why choose your brand?</p><p> The best B2B content marketers don&rsquo;t bore their audiences with standard descriptions of benefits and features. Leave that up to the sales people! Instead, they aim at convincing prospects to recognize that an issue exists and leading them to making their own conclusions on how, when and where to do business in the future. This advice may sound a little vague, but the exact &ldquo;how&rdquo; of accomplishing this goal is best  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   discussed one-on-one with a content strategist  </a> </u> , as every business is unique.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%23ContentMarketing+Tip%3A+Use+Bold+Language%2C+Action+Words+and+Tell+a+Story&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/top-8-practices-b2b-content-marketers-use-successful/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   #ContentMarketing Tip: Use Bold Language, Action Words and Tell a Story  </u> </a></p><h3> 7. Measurement Tools</h3><p> <br/> According to the Content Marketing Institute, only 5% of B2B content marketers feel they are &ldquo;very successful&rdquo; at measuring and tracking return-on-investment. YIKES! How can you write more compelling content and build upon successful topics if you don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s resonating with your audience? A discussion of all the tools and measurements goes beyond the scope of one article, but  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/awesome-google-analytics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Analytics  </a> </u>  is a great place to start assessing your content&rsquo;s performance if you haven&rsquo;t already.

Corporate Culture That Fosters Thought Leadership</h3><p> <br/> Mod Girl Marketing works closely with internal point people to ensure that the content strategy we develop fosters thought leadership and gets your experts out in front of a large audience. No one knows your company better than the people eating, sleeping and breathing the culture day-in and day-out. We do a lot of the leg work, but we pick your brains for internal subject matter, strive to answer questions customers bring to your support team, and identify opportunities to nurture customer relationships through each step of the buying process. Content and customer relations cannot be viewed as separate departments. Your company culture has to treat each department as spokes on the same wheel, which all work together to move the vehicle of progress forward.</p><h3>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10-point-thought-leadership-system_5273d9b79b5b0_w1500.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"10-point-thought-leadership-system\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10-point-thought-leadership-system_5273d9b79b5b0_w1500.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"https://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/10-point-thought-leadership-system_5273d9b79b5b0_w1500.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Visual.ly  </a> </u></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 19:23:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 19:23:14.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_VevKuTG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/top-8-practices-b2b-content-marketers-use-to-be-successful/\", \"post_id\": \"5532\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 19:23:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 19:23:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"top-8-practices-b2b-content-marketers-use-to-be-successful\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5531\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2507\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439885919809-2c43fa0c7d31-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"831\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440010800,"author_id":316,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2451,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Things Change!","link":"things-change","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Summer is quickly coming to a close. My  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KleinFinancialAdvisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook feed  </a> </u>  is full of pictures of my friends&rsquo; kids who are starting high school and heading off to college, and adorable images of the younger ones with their big, toothless grins announcing their start of kindergarten. All of that  <strong>  back-to-school </strong>  activity has me thinking about fresh starts. And change.</p><p> My client Kathy and I met the other day to review her finances and see if early retirement was an option for her. She&rsquo;s more than ready emotionally, and she&rsquo;d &ldquo;done the numbers&rdquo; and figured out she could make it work. She handed me a list of her fixed and day-to-day expenses, but what was missing was a personal &ldquo;escrow account&rdquo; to cover longer term and unexpected expenses that are harder to manage when a monthly income is no longer coming in the door: saving for a new car three to five years down the road, minor and major home repairs, increases in medical costs, and more. And while we were able to figure out a good plan that will allow her to retire comfortably in 2016, change is never simple. There were a lot more pieces to the puzzle than she&rsquo;d realized.</p><p> Kathy is no exception. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a client to come to me with no particular money issue in mind, but once we start talking, I realize there has in fact been a change that requires some rethinking when it comes to finances. If you&rsquo;re a client, you know I always kick-off  <strong>  financial review </strong>  meetings with two questions: &ldquo;What is your biggest financial concern right now?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is your biggest non-financial concern right now?&rdquo; What I find is that it&rsquo;s often the non-financial concerns that raise the biggest flags for change:</p><p> Larry and Lisa, both in their mid-70s with no kids, came in for a mid-year review. Larry&rsquo;s biggest &ldquo;non-financial&rdquo; issue was that his younger brother was having some major health issues and was just forced to foreclose on his house. Adding his brother as a second beneficiary on Larry&rsquo;s life insurance and IRA would provide some much-needed support for him in the future&mdash;he just hadn&rsquo;t thought about the possibility.</p><p> Kerry&rsquo;s mother is in her early 70s, and her general health is pretty good. She works out at the gym regularly and walks every day. But she&rsquo;s fallen and ended up in a rehab facility with broken bones twice in the last two years. As an only child, Kerry didn&rsquo;t realize the impact her mother&rsquo;s health could have on her finances. I suggested Kerry talk to her mother now to make decisions that may impact them both sooner than expected.</p><p> At 59, Martin is planning to propose to his long-time partner, Marie, who is 60. The plans were all laid, and he was very excited about the pending event. What he didn&rsquo;t realize was that re-marrying before age 60 would significantly impact his partner&rsquo;s future Social Security widow benefits; enjoying a long engagement and delaying the actual wedding would add an extra $1500 to their monthly income in retirement. Even if they decide not to wait, they&rsquo;re aware of the some of the financial &ldquo;marriage penalties.&rdquo;</p><p> Other changes are less subtle:</p><p> Ken and Katherine love their home, but now that they&rsquo;re in their late 70s, the house and yard work is more than they can manage. They could afford to hire help, but they&rsquo;re concerned about living independently for the long term. Driving is becoming an issue and they feel isolated, but the low cost of owning their home without a  <strong>  mortgage </strong>  and with the benefit of Proposition 13 makes the choice complicated.</p><p> Lena moved from Northern California to take care of her elderly mother, but she was just diagnosed with a terminal illness herself. The fact that Lena&rsquo;s mother will almost certainly outlive her requires a major shift in her financial and estate plans.</p><p> Judy just changed jobs, and her new employer gave her a sizable sign-on bonus. Plus, she has to figure out what to do with the  <strong>  401(k) </strong>  at her old employer. It would be easy to just leave it where it is, but she wants to know what makes the most sense for her long-term plans.</p><p> Subtle or not, change is a constant&mdash;for us and for others in our lives. It&rsquo;s not just the school kids who are moving forward. No matter how young or old you may be, it&rsquo;s a great time of year to look at all the changes in your life and, with a little help, identify which changes affect your finances and make the necessary adjustments to be sure you stay on track toward your long-term financial goals.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 19:14:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 19:14:13.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_5jajfzx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/things-change/\", \"post_id\": \"5530\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 19:14:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 19:14:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"things-change\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5529\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2506\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439301261348-f22a437276b5-copy_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"349\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440003600,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2450,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Future of Retirement Is Now","link":"the-future-of-retirement-is-now","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Gray, small, and distinctly female.This is what the director of MIT&rsquo;s AgeLab, Joseph Coughlin, sees when he peers into the future of retirement.&ldquo;The context and definition of retirement is changing,&rdquo; Coughlin said earlier this month at the Retirement Research Consortium meeting, where nearly two dozen researchers also presented their Consortium-funded work on a range of retirement topics. Their research summaries can be found at  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/about-us/events/2015-retirement-research-consortium-meeting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this link  </a> </u>  to the Center for Retirement Research, which supports this blog and is a consortium member.Coughlin spooled out a list of stunning facts to impress on his audience the dramatic impact of rising longevity and graying populations in the developed world, and he urged them to think in fresh ways about retirement. In Japan, for example, adult diapers are outselling baby diapers. China already faces a looming worker shortage, and Germany&rsquo;s population is in sharp decline. In 2047, there will be more Americans over age 60 than children under 15.&ldquo;The country will have the demographics of Florida,&rdquo; Coughlin said.The attitudes and comportment of the ballooning population of U.S. retirees &ndash; baby boomers &ndash; will be more confident and less polite than their parents&rsquo; generation, he predicted.The U.S. labor force is also graying with the aging population. The average age of physicians in this country is already 53, and it&rsquo;s 49 for nurses, 51 for truck drivers, 56 for financial advisers, and 50 for engineers. In five years, more than one-quarter of the U.S. labor force will be over 55, according to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://162.144.124.243/~longevl0/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_Aging_U.S.-Workforce.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stanford Center on Longevity  </a> </u> . And an AARP study finds that 40 percent of boomers say they plan to work &ldquo;until they drop.&rdquo; But to assume you can keep working, because &ldquo;you have a master&rsquo;s or PhD is a joke,&rdquo; Coughlin warned. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stay aggressive about your learning, you&rsquo;ll fall behind.&rdquo;When he says the future is &ldquo;small,&rdquo; he means family size is shrinking, with implications for retirees and the elderly. More Americans today than in the 1970s live in a household of one, especially women. In the 1970s, nine out of 10 women had children, but today just eight out of 10 do, he said. This points to a future in which there will be  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/family-network-for-elderly-to-dwindle/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fewer children  </a> </u>  to care for aging parents. And fewer caregiving spouses: divorce among people over age 50 has also increased dramatically in recent decades.As the population ages, he sees women, who tend to live longer, becoming more influential, because they already make decisions about retirement and child care. Women, particularly oldest daughters, also do the heavy lifting for parental care.Older people today are &ldquo;old but not sick,&rdquo; but they have multiple chronic conditions, often managed with multiple medications. Aging in the home will be a prime location for the kind of technological innovations  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.josephcoughlin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Coughlin&rsquo;s AgeLab  </a> </u>  specializes in.He predicted that seniors increasingly will rely on  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/longevity-promoting-gadgets-are-here/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   gadgets  </a> </u>  like implantable sensors to monitor their blood pressure or smart mirrors that detect worrisome changes in their health or gait. He even talked about a $100,000 pop-up house, so mothers-in-law can live (alone?) in their children&rsquo;s back yard.The future is here, and Coughlin suggests that everyone &ldquo;really rethink the contract around what retirement is.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 19:09:28.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 19:09:28.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_DJPQsnD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-future-of-retirement-is-now/\", \"post_id\": \"5528\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 19:09:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 19:09:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-future-of-retirement-is-now\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5527\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2505\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439798060585-62ab242d7724-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"635\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439984700,"author_id":280,"chart_url":""}

In fact, you need to do more than that. You need to seek it out.</p><p> Both science and the arts have long known the power of weird.</p><p> Jaron Lanier, in his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/two-philosophies-of-mathematical-weirdness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article  </a> </u> , &ldquo;Two Philosophies of Mathematical Weirdness&rdquo; stated:</p><p> &ldquo;A strange thing happened to the philosophy of mathematics in the past century or so: Mathematics increasingly revealed truths about itself that utterly confounded the expectations of philosophers. In other words, math got weird. A century ago, math was thought to be an orderly Platonic phenomenon, imperious in its perfection. The first prominent onset of weirdness came in 1931, when Kurt G&ouml;del indexed mathematical ideas in a way that was somewhat analogous to the way the Web is now indexed by services such as Google. That computational framework began to give mathematicians a completely new perspective.&rdquo;</p><p> Music is another realm where dissonance and discord can lead to creative brilliance.</p><p> The premiere of Igor Stravinsky&rsquo;s ballet, The Rite of Spring, just over a century ago in Paris, incited a riot &ndash; and was one of the most notorious performances of the 20th century.</p><p> Why? It was different. It was unexpected. It was just plain &lsquo;weird&rsquo;.</p><p> In his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/29/4375736/igor-stravinsky-rite-of-spring-100-anniversary-paris-riot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article  </a> </u>  about the 100-year anniversary of the The Rite of Spring, Amar Toon says:</p><p> &ldquo;Today, The Rite is widely regarded as a seminal work of modernism &mdash; a frenetic, jagged orchestral ballet that boldly rejected the ordered harmonies and comfort of traditional composition. The piece would go on to leave an indelible mark on jazz, minimalism, and other contemporary movements, but to many who saw it on that balmy evening a century ago, it was nothing short of scandalous.&rdquo;</p><p> Routine, rigidity and monotony are villains of creativity. They make us lazy and complacent.</p><h3> Here are 5 ways for leaders to embrace discord and foster innovation:</h3><p> <br/> 1. <strong>  Use the Creative Whack Pack by world expert on creativity,   <u>   Roger Van Oech  </u>  , as often as you can. </strong>  This creative tool is like your own little pocket book of weirdness. It&rsquo;s brilliant for looking at things differently and engaging your right brain.</p><p> 2. <strong>  Learn to manage and cultivate conflicting opinions. </strong>  Detest groupthink. Encourage people to come up with the &ldquo;idea that will get you fired&rdquo;.</p><p> 3. <strong>  Put weird on your radar. </strong>  If you notice words like &lsquo;bizarre&rsquo;, &lsquo;strange&rsquo; or &lsquo;odd&rsquo; flying around the office, this is your cue to perk up and follow the trail.</p><p> 4. <strong>  Embrace deviants and rebels in your team. </strong>   <u>  My father </u> , an expert on gifted and talented children, often commented that the naughtiest kids (and the ones most likely to drop out of school) were often the brightest. The same applies to the misfits in your organisation; those people who regularly upset the apple cart.</p><p> 5. <strong>  Have your next team building at an art gallery. </strong>  Every time I look at art works by  <a href=\"https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=tony+fomison&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;%E2%80%A6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tony Fomison  </u>    </a> or the haunting photographs of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=yvonne+Todd+creamy+psychology&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=622&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQsARqFQoTCNCZqOT528YCFaXGpgodhfMFKg)\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Yvonne Todd&rsquo;s Creamy Psychology  </a> </u> , I&rsquo;m mesmerised by the slightly off-beat nature of their art.</p><p> As the weirdness of their art draws me in, I&rsquo;m OK knowing I&rsquo;m wooing weird.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 19:02:50.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 19:02:50.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_31dokLM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/weird-is-good-why-dissonance-fosters-innovation/\", \"post_id\": \"5526\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 19:02:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 19:02:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"weird-is-good-why-dissonance-fosters-innovation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5525\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2504\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Weird-Is-Good.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"548\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440000000,"author_id":467,"chart_url":""}

One of the most important is that &ldquo;life&rdquo; and &ldquo;work&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t nearly as separate as many believe. There is a thin, if any, line between them and your happiness and success. Another lesson is that the attitudes you carry permeate analogously through both.</p><p> Based on my experience working with people from many walks of life and hundreds of professions, I&rsquo;ve noticed some &ldquo;thought culprits&rdquo; that hold back those that would otherwise be much happier and more successful.</p><p> <strong>  You think major setbacks are dreadful. </strong> Nonsense. The major setbacks you face as you pursue your life&rsquo;s purpose will never hurt as much as the accumulation of half-hearted stumbles you continually encounter performing acts you don&rsquo;t love for people you don&rsquo;t care about.</p><p> <strong>  You think you shouldn&rsquo;t speak your mind.  </strong> Always speak your mind, especially when it makes your voice shake. Just remember to speak your mind tactfully. If the person on the listening end isn&rsquo;t interested, whether personally or professionally, reevaluate whether he or she is worth your time.</p><p> <strong>  You think you need to surround yourself with people who think like you and tote &ldquo;normal&rdquo; thinking. </strong> I like to surround myself with people who provoke the status quo, not ones who regurgitate it to me. You don&rsquo;t need someone to tell you you&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;re better off with someone who stimulates and expands your thinking.</p><p> <strong>  You think because you work hard you&rsquo;ll get ahead. </strong> At the end of every day, don&rsquo;t ask yourself whether you worked hard. No one cares. Ask yourself whether you accomplished anything worthwhile. (No one cares about this either, but at least you&rsquo;ll be progressing.) Some days you&rsquo;ll have to work harder than others for that answer to be &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  You think the world has limits. </strong> No one who thinks according to a process, with constraints, budgets, or whatever other parameters they feel necessary to operate within has ever created anything unique and amazing. Genius comes from someone who has a vision free of constraints and without regard for resources, and was able to find the passion and energy to make it work.</p><p> <strong>  You think your life is someone else&rsquo;s responsibility. </strong> Maybe you chuckled at this one, but most people believe this. It&rsquo;s statistically proven that 75% of individuals are externally focused. That is, they default to thoughts such as  My boss is driving me crazy or I wouldn&rsquo;t be in this position if it weren&rsquo;t for heror I would have gotten that promotion if it weren&rsquo;t for him. Become internally focused so you think I need to react better to the way my boss treats me or I&rsquo;ll see what I can do to help us get out of this position or I&rsquo;ll work harder next time so I earn the promotion.</p><p> <strong>  You think life should go according to plan. </strong> Just because you have a plan and operate it effectively doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll be successful. Plans are wonderful when used correctly, but I like to emphasize that in most cases history has shown us that you, your team, or your company already has all the resources you&rsquo;ll ever need to accomplish something. You&rsquo;ll never have the know-how to actually accomplish anything, however, until after you act. And, every act you perform along the way will require you to alter your plan is some way.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 18:48:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 18:48:49.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_tB2P93y.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-thoughts-holding-you-back/\", \"post_id\": \"5522\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 18:48:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 18:48:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-thoughts-holding-you-back\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5521\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2502\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439901948849-20b62e62a557-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"374\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439989200,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}

In the days since, many analysts and &ldquo;experts&rdquo; have irrationally turned sour on the Asian country, similar to the extreme  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/gold-on-sale-says-the-rational-investor/#.Vc4ivv50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   bearishness toward gold  </a> </u>  in the last month.</p><p> But investors last week came home to the yellow metal after China announced it had increased its gold reserves by an additional 19 tonnes in July, boosting its total holdings to 1,677 tonnes (nearly 54 million ounces). This helped prices rally 1.4 percent on Wednesday to reach $1,124.46, a three-week high.</p><p> Investors should likewise return to China when they realize that the global reaction to the renminbi devaluation has been hugely overblown. I agree entirely with my friend Addison Wiggins, who writes in his Daily Reckoning newsletter:</p><p> The market is up in arms about this currency move. And frankly most things that I read from the market have it all wrong&hellip;</p><p> They make China out to be the big, bad villain&mdash;calling this move manipulation or a &ldquo;currency war.&rdquo; And while EVERYTHING that central banks do is indeed manipulation or a &ldquo;currency war&rdquo;&mdash;why don&rsquo;t we hear those terms thrown around the ECB or the U.S. Fed?</p><p> To help cut through the noise and get a more balanced picture of devaluation's causes, effects and possible ramifications, I chatted with our resident Asia expert Xian Liang, portfolio manager of our  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/china-region-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   China Region Fund (USCOX)  </u>  . </a>  Below are some of the highlights.</p><p> <strong>  As you know, we follow currencies very closely in our investment team meetings because we&rsquo;re aware that government policy is a precursor to change. Having said that, why did China decide to devalue the renminbi? </strong></p><p> There are several possible reasons, the first one being economics&mdash;specifically, to stimulate economic growth and ease liquidity in the financial sector. A weaker renminbi can help make Chinese exports cheaper for foreigners and imports dearer for locals, creating the incentive for a &ldquo;net inflow&rdquo; of money. July data shows that economic activity remains worse than expected. China&rsquo;s purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI) reading for the month is one example, but fixed-asset investments, power generation and exports were all down.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-14/comm-chinas-manufacturing-pmi-falls-to-two-year-low-in-july-08142015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"chinas-manufacturing-pmi-falls-to-two-year-low-in-july\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-14/comm-chinas-manufacturing-pmi-falls-to-two-year-low-in-july-08142015.png\"/> </a></p><p> Deflationary pressure also intensified in July, and the renminbi in trade-weighted terms&mdash;that is, against a whole basket of major trading partners&rsquo; currencies, not just the dollar&mdash;has soared to record highs. This is because of a de facto peg to the dollar, making Chinese goods and services uncompetitively priced to world customers.</p><p> Another reason is domestic politics. Chinese policymakers want to resurrect their reformist image among domestic intellectuals and the middle class by yielding more power to market forces to determine its currency exchange rate, which offers some compensation for July&rsquo;s aggressive, command-and-control intervention in the A-Share market.</p><p> And then there&rsquo;s international politics. It&rsquo;s well known that China wishes its currency to be included in the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s special drawing rights basket, along with the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and Japanese yen. Chinese policymakers are actively demonstrating to the IMF their commitment to &ldquo;a more market-determined exchange rate,&rdquo; a critical step toward eventual renminbi internationalization.</p><p> <strong>  Many countries have devalued their currencies lately&mdash;Japan, Germany, France and others. Business Insider, in fact, just shared a Goldman Sachs chart showing how miniscule the renminbi&rsquo;s depreciation really is compared to other emerging countries&rsquo; currencies. And yet China gets singled out in the media! Why is everyone so hard on China? </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-14/COMM-Renminbi-depreciation-not-nearly-significant-as-other-emerging-markets-currencies-08142015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Renminbi-depreciation-not-nearly-significant-as-other-emerging-markets-currencies\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-14/COMM-Renminbi-depreciation-not-nearly-significant-as-other-emerging-markets-currencies-08142015.png\"/> </a></p><p> What&rsquo;s usually not mentioned in all the news and editorials we&rsquo;ve seen is that China hasn&rsquo;t resorted to currency devaluation in 20 years. For the last decade, the renminbi was largely moving in a single direction&mdash;up&mdash;because China was tired of being dubbed a currency manipulator and it would like to foster consumerism.</p><p> As the second-largest economy in the world, China is interested in transforming its growth model from investment-driven to consumer-driven, and some investors might wonder how the devaluation will affect consumption. Today, the richer Chinese middle class is made up of big spenders, both home and abroad, and a weaker renminbi translates to weaker purchasing power for them. It might also have larger implications for global tourism, global consumer goods and global property. So the difference between China and, say, France is pretty significant.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-14/COMM-Chinas-central-bank-trims-the-renminbi-2-after-10-years-of-gains-08142015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Chinas-Central-Bank-Trims-the-Renminbi-2-After-10-years-of-Gains\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-14/COMM-Chinas-central-bank-trims-the-renminbi-2-after-10-years-of-gains-08142015.png\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  A lot of people think the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this year&mdash;maybe even as early as September&mdash;though I&rsquo;ve expressed doubts about that. Will the devaluation have any effect on the Fed&rsquo;s decision? </strong></p><p> To the extent that it weakens its own currency, China exports deflation to the U.S. and can help the dollar&rsquo;s strength. Lower inflation and a stronger dollar reduce the incentive or rationale for any imminent Fed rate hike. So yes, you can almost say this is China&rsquo;s silent protest against the widely anticipated September hike. China seems to be reminding Janet Yellen that in today&rsquo;s interconnected world, unilateral monetary policy action by the U.S. without first considering global dynamics might not be the smartest thing to do. In effect, it&rsquo;s saying: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a preview of what could happen if you insist on hiking rates this year.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Is this a sign of further reforms? What else can we expect?  </strong></p><p> The devaluation does indeed herald back to the days of major Chinese reform. In fact, it occurred one day after China approved a comprehensive plan to reform its state-owned enterprises to make them more market-driven, similar to those in Singapore. So at least the government welcomes the perception that the devaluation has more to do with long-term structural reform and less to do with short-term expediency.</p><p> <strong>  Investors are being bombarded with bad news about China right now. There have been some very negative headlines. Where&rsquo;s the good news in all this? </strong></p><p> Here&rsquo;s the simple answer: A weaker currency not only helps Chinese exporters but also U.S. consumers. Whether you buy things made in China or are planning your next vacation there, you&rsquo;ve got money to save now. Opportunities have also been expanded for U.S. retailers and manufacturers that source from China, not to mention U.S. airlines. And if you&rsquo;re in the camp that believes this devaluation is the start of a new &ldquo;currency war,&rdquo; then it might be time for gold to shine.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 18:00:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 18:00:20.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_O2P9XDH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/china-not-immune-to-contagious-quantitative-easing-and-massive-printing-of-cheap-money/\", \"post_id\": \"5514\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 18:00:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 18:00:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"china-not-immune-to-contagious-quantitative-easing-and-massive-printing-of-cheap-money\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5513\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2499\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-18-at-11.01.45-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"827\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439983800,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2444,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Seniors' Desperation: A Perfect Tool For Elder Abuse","link":"seniors-desperation-a-perfect-tool-for-elder-abuse","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Can you think of anything that makes a person more desperate than being in pain?  You can&rsquo;t stand it and you want to stop it. Maybe you&rsquo;ll fall for anything that promises to end your pain.</p><p> My mother in law, Alice, now 92 was feeling like that. She had chronic knee pain that was getting worse.  She went with some friends to one of those &ldquo;free lunch seminars&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve told you about here at  <u>  AgingInvestor.com </u> . They are always a vehicle for selling something.</p><p> This one was put on near a large Sun City seniors&rsquo; community.  The place is full of fairly well to do elders, some quite wealthy.  Nice target, right?  The perpetrator in this situation was a  <strong>  chiropractor </strong> .  He knew exactly what he was doing, promising to end everyone&rsquo;s chronic pain.  All they had to do was sign up for his &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; to work pain relief program for a mere $3000 payable in advance and of course, nonrefundable.  He carefully never put the guarantee in writing, but he used verbally it to seduce anyone there into believing his promise of pain relief.</p><p> Alice called me and asked about the chiropractor. She doesn&rsquo;t know how to do internet research.  I checked him out. Shady. No good reviews. Bad sign, even though his license was valid. That means nothing.  I advised her not to go through with his program and politely told her there were suspicious things I found in checking him out.  She said she was ready to try anything and he assured her that everyone got good results. She went anyway.</p><p> The chiropractor in question didn&rsquo;t even see her. His assistant did the work, which involved very brief &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; and a very long pressured talk  to try to get her to buy his expensive supplements which they now said would enable the treatment to work.  As the scam became more obvious, Alice got disgusted. The &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; did nothing at all for her pain.  She quit and asked for her money back. No dice.  They essentially told her to get lost if she didn&rsquo;t care to come back.</p><p> Mikol and I got her permission and filed a complaint with the State Chiropractic Board. The Board prosecutes fraud and license violations through the state Attorney General. They pursued the chiropractor, eventually settling with him.  He paid a fine and was probably placed on probation. Big deal.  Of course none of this gets Alice her money back.  At last check he&rsquo;s still in business.</p><p> What did Alice do about her chronic pain?  Medical marijuana is legal in CA. She got a card, and got some cream for her knees. That and medical marijuana oral drops work rather well. She&rsquo;s back on her treadmill for exercise.  The marijuana she takes has no mind-altering component, so it&rsquo;s just pain relief.</p><p> What can professionals do about these scams promising pain relief?  First, share this story with your own clients.  Pain relief is a big opportunity for scammers. They may be chiropractors or others who have some kind of license. They may be selling magic potions on the internet.   It could start with one amount and escalate as it did with the chiropractor to expensive add ons, his &ldquo;supplements&rdquo;.</p><p> Recent research shows that many seniors who get taken for relatively small amounts of money often become victims in escalating amounts over time. They want to trust when they feel desperate and that makes them vulnerable to manipulation.</p><p> What can you do as a professional to stop the ripoff artist?  Here are three things:</p><p> 1.   If you learn about this sort of shady character,  <strong>  encourage your client to fight back </strong> .  File a complaint. Write a letter to the entity in power.  Don&rsquo;t just give up in embarrassment.  You can offer your help with paperwork or complaint form.</p><p> 2. <strong>   Spread the word. </strong> If you have a list of aging clients, warn them by email about any shady operations in your area.  You never know who you might be saving by doing that.</p><p> 3. <strong>  Make it public. </strong> If your client&rsquo;s story is particularly awful and you get permission to share it, local newspapers, TV or radio stations may be interested in it.  That&rsquo;s one way to educate and thwart these predators.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 17:54:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 17:54:57.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_UgsKE2g.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/seniors-desperation-a-perfect-tool-for-elder-abuse/\", \"post_id\": \"5512\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 17:54:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 17:54:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"seniors-desperation-a-perfect-tool-for-elder-abuse\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5511\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2498\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/old-person-wheel-chair.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"327\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440004500,"author_id":155,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2443,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Seven Simple Rules for Selling to Senior Executives","link":"seven-simple-rules-for-selling-to-senior-executives","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jberiker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   James Beriker  </u> </a>  </p><p> With every new venture-backed software-as-a-service, ad-tech or media startup that springs up in Silicon Valley or New York, there is eventually a new crop of sales people, all with fresh marketing material, lead lists, and quotas. Their job: to help the company grow into its last valuation or secure the next round of financing. Competition for business-to-business (B2B) budgets is at an all-time high and my inbox, voicemail, InMail and social media accounts are overflowing with messages from salespeople who want &ldquo;just 15 minutes&rdquo; of my time.</p><p> <a href=\"http://beriker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sales-pitch1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"sales pitch\" src=\"http://beriker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sales-pitch1-1024x479.jpg\"/> </a> <br/> As critical as sales is to the success of any company, particularly in the B2B segment where outcomes are determined by sales and revenue momentum, the  quality  of the sales function seems to be at an all-time low. </p><p> So, in the spirit of decreasing my own pain, and the pain of others who are in the line-of-fire, the following are seven very simple best practices for selling to senior executives like me.</p><p> <strong>  1- Earn the opportunity to engage with me. </strong>  You probably get some credit for effort: number of emails sent; number of calls made; voicemails left; time on phone, etc. Like many executives, I receive 25+ weekly requests for my time or for a referral to someone else on our team. No matter how persistent or creative you are, you will not rise above the noise unless you establish credibility. There are only two ways to do this: (1) send me valuable data or information that is easy to consume, directly relevant to my business, and reflects your value proposition; or, (2) get an introduction from someone I know who believes my company would benefit from your product or service&ndash;even better if that person is already your customer. Do this, and you are likely to get a meeting. </p><p> <strong>  2- Prepare me for the meeting. </strong>   If you get a call or meeting, it is on you to make sure that it is productive. At least two days before, send me an agenda and an email summarizing the value proposition of your product or service  for my company , how it&rsquo;s differentiated and better than other offerings, and a general idea of what it would cost. If you can get a head start on helping me understand those things, we can have a real conversation. Your email should be short, customized for my business, and should include a copy of your presentation. </p><p> <strong>  3- Get to the point&ndash;and focus on the value proposition of your product or service on my business. </strong> If we&rsquo;re meeting in person, arrive early to set up your presentation. If we&rsquo;re meeting on the phone, make sure you are on the bridge before me and have your presentation ready to go. Please don&rsquo;t bother with small talk&ndash; no need to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; with me on something you learned about me on LinkedIn. Briefly introduce yourself and your company, and then clearly explain to me why my company can&rsquo;t live without your product or service. This is a very high bar. Any new relationship, especially if there are integration requirements, requires resources and creates overhead inside an organization. Before I agree to divert resources to you, I must believe that we  can&rsquo;t live without  what you&rsquo;re selling, i.e., that your product or service can help my company generate  materially  more revenue, save  significant  costs, or muchmore effectively compete in my market. As a senior executive, those three things&ndash;plus how I use my time and how the company deploys its resources&ndash; are the things I care about most. </p><p> <strong>  4- Do your research. </strong>  You will instantly lose any credibility you earned to land the meeting if you demonstrate that you have not done your research. If the answer to your &ldquo;qualifying question&rdquo; is available through a little simple research, you&rsquo;re done. If you&rsquo;re selling me a recruiting tool and you don&rsquo;t know how many jobs I have open on my public career site, you&rsquo;re done. Show me you care about more than just taking me through your process&ndash; and have invested the time to understand my business and think about how your product or service meets my needs.</p><p> <strong>  5- Know your product or service. </strong> The only thing worse than not doing your research about my business is not understanding your product or service inside-out. You should be able to answer any question that I ask, whether technical or related to your business, competition or market. If you don&rsquo;t know your stuff&ndash;and defer to sales engineers and account managers&ndash;what value are you adding to the conversation?</p><p> <strong>  6- Less talking, more listening. </strong>  It is very easy to &ldquo;swing into gear&rdquo; once our meeting starts&ndash;fire up your PowerPoint and &ldquo;take me through&rdquo; your canned presentation. Getting into this comfort zone might help you get through the meeting, but you won&rsquo;t get any closer to a sale. Don&rsquo;t build the meeting around your presentation and sales script. Build it around what you know about my business and your thesis for why you can help&ndash;and listen for clues. Every question I ask is a reveal, an invitation to steer the discussion towards me. Shame on you if you miss it.</p><p> <strong>  7- Please, don&rsquo;t be a salesman. </strong>   Your biggest challenge is to convince me that you are not a salesman. In other words, even though you are an advocate, or even better, an evangelist, for your product or service, you understand that salesmanship is about conveying value, not just taking it.

{"original_id":2442,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Filing for Bankruptcy Is Smart","link":"why-filing-for-bankruptcy-is-smart","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Chad Van Horn | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VHLawGroup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Van Horn Law Group  </u> </a></p><p> In the public eye, filing for bankruptcy is seen as a sign of failure. The usual image of a man gone bankrupt is someone who cannot make ends meet and thus fails completely, forfeiting his assets and throwing himself at the mercy of the creditors. Nothing could be further from the truth; in fact, bankruptcy is a process designed specifically to improve a person&rsquo;s quality of life in a multitude of ways.</p><h3> Filing For Bankruptcy Affords a Fresh Start and Frees You from Stress</h3><p> <br/> In practice, those who declare bankruptcy are people acutely aware of their financial situation and choose the right tools to tackle their problems. After you run out of options, bankruptcy remains an open way to solve your problem. According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/02/insolvency-after-the-2005-bankruptcy-reform.html#.VaKagPmqpBc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent study  </a> </u> , households that have declared bankruptcy exhibit better long term financial health than those who avoid it like the plague.</p><p> It's not an experience that&rsquo;s entirely free of hassle or stress, of course, but it focuses all the problems into a single moment in time before leaving you with a fresh slate (if filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy) or with a clear roadmap to success for the next several years (under Chapter 13). Bankruptcy is a drastic, but ultimately positive measure.</p><h3> It Helps You Make Smart Decisions</h3><p> <br/> Financial stress, especially when it brings you into poverty (objective or subjective) is actually damaging to your mental health. A 2013 study brought to the fore conclusions that shouldn't be surprising: Financial stress causes people to make poor or very poor decisions when it comes to their personal finances. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/your-brain-on-poverty-why-poor-people-seem-to-make-bad-decisions/281780/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   it's estimated to cause a loss of up to 13 IQ points  </u> </a> .</p><p> Filing for bankruptcy is smart because it helps you either discharge your debt or restructure it. In both cases, it helps you stabilize your financial situation and relieve yourself of the burden it imposes on you. Indirectly, it also helps you make smart decisions by preserving your smarts.</p><h3> You're Not Alone</h3><p> <br/> Bankruptcy rates are high across the nation if we take into account the broad view. The bankruptcy rates have soared over the past forty years. In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/bridges/spring-2006/100-years-of-bankruptcy-why-more-americans-than-ever-are-filing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   they have quadrupled between 1980 and 2004, and rose by a factor of 80 when compared to 1920  </a> </u> . While many would like to pin the blame on individuals for bankruptcies, the reasons behind this surge are numerous and few are really connected to a debtor's inability to take care of their finances.</p><p> It's a combination of a changing economy, inflation, rising wealth inequality, prices and the runaway education debt that topped $1 trillion recently. A debtor who declares bankruptcy shouldn't feel shame. It's an adequate, smart response to an inadequate financial burden placed on them.</p><h3> Summary</h3><p> <br/> When your back is up against the wall, figuratively speaking, you should use appropriate measures. Bankruptcy is drastic, but it is a smart move, made by smart people. Limping ahead, chafing under the burden of debt is not a sustainable solution and it will end up giving you more trouble than facing the problem head on and eliminating it once and for all.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 17:26:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 17:26:12.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_2p03q06.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-filing-for-bankruptcy-is-smart/\", \"post_id\": \"5508\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 17:26:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 17:26:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-filing-for-bankruptcy-is-smart\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5507\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2496\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bk.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1131\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439996400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

I have dealt with insurance companies, for example, which seem to put up barriers to prevent customers from talking to people who can actually solve their problem. If you buy a consumer product, like a camera or software program, and it breaks, good luck trying to call the manufacturer.</p><p> Most service professionals would read this question and say, &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m easy to do business with. I call people back quickly and I answer my email messages within a few hours. I&rsquo;m responsive!&rdquo;</p><h3> But you have you truly reduced all of the friction of doing business with you, in every respect?</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s an example of &ldquo;easy to do business with.&rdquo; Last year I started working out with a personal trainer, Jeff Della Penna, at Santa Fe Spa health club in Santa Fe, NM, where we have a home. Besides being very good, he was very easy to interact with. Here&rsquo;s what I mean:</p><p> He gave me a free, one-hour initial training session and consultation. Then, when it came time to schedule further sessions, he told me, &ldquo;My schedule for the next 4 weeks is on my clipboard, on the wall. Just grab it and write your name down in any slot you want.&rdquo; Just like that&mdash;no trading voice messages or emails, just sign up whenever there&rsquo;s a free time that suits you! Now that&rsquo;s &ldquo;frictionless&rdquo; scheduling&hellip;a bit like choosing your own car to rent at National Car Rental.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s what &ldquo;ease of doing business with you&rdquo; might mean for a professional advisor: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  For certain clients, you guarantee you&rsquo;ll return phone calls </strong> and emails within a certain time period (e.g., 90 minutes or two hours, etc.)</li><li> <strong>  Your wisdom is accessible. </strong> I have noticed that the partners at some large firms I work with can get into the habit of deferring a response to a client question. They say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll consult internally and get back to you&rdquo; or &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put a deck together on that topic for you&rdquo;&mdash;rather than giving their best answer on the spot and then offering to go deeper. Executives want a great conversation, not a stream of lengthy memos or PowerPoint decks!</li><li> <strong>  The cycle times for dealing with you are short. </strong> If clients ask for a proposal, do you get something brief but to-the-point back to them in a few days? Or does it take weeks? If they ask you to review something that&rsquo;s important, can you manage to get to it rapidly?</li><li> <strong>  There is flexibility in your schedule to accommodate &ldquo;walk ins.&rdquo; </strong> I find it&rsquo;s essential to maintain some slack in my schedule to provide some flexibility to clients who may need to meet on short notice (and that slack always gets filled, by the way!). Some doctors do this&mdash;they keep some appointment slots open each day&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a lifesaver if you need a same-day appointment. Others tell you to come in three days from now, even though you&rsquo;ve got a raging fever!</li><li> <strong>  Do you try and do things for your clients that you know are high-value for them but inexpensive for you to deliver? </strong> The result can be great value for the client and a good margin for you. Examples could include sharing pre-existing data, offering to be available for phone coaching, and so on.</li><li> <strong>  Is your website frictionless? </strong> Is it easy to find information, download a bio, access videos, etc.? Is it also set up to easily share your content with others? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  What have you done to make it easy for clients to have a relationship with you and do business with you? </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-18 15:47:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-18 15:47:31.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_nrJiwIT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-easy-to-do-business-with/\", \"post_id\": \"5506\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-18 15:47:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-18 15:47:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-easy-to-do-business-with\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5505\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2495\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/washington-dc-anchor-capitol-building-night-full.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"567\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439982000,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2440,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Days Along the Southern Coast of Spain","link":"7-days-along-the-southern-coast-of-spain","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Spain Itinerary</h3><p> <br/> The beautiful and historic stretch of coast along southern Spain, reaching to the tip of Tarifa, makes one gorgeous private luxury yacht charter itinerary. Along the Costa del Sol, ancient cultures mix with chic, contemporary parties, stylish resorts, and interesting history, to make this a week you&rsquo;ll wish could write across your entire summer calendar. Although only 7 days, The Best of Yachting Costa del Sol intinerary suggests some fabulous highlights.</p><p> Timing, they say, is everything, and while there are exceptional things to do and see all year, you should definitely fold these events into the mix if you can: The Spanish Grand Prix, just outside Barcelona from May 8-10, the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona from July 7-14, or party season on the island of Ibiza, with special opening ceremonies the first two weeks of May and closing parties at the end of September. The Best of Yachting&rsquo;s suggested itinerary soaks up seven days of glorious Spanish sun, from the Straits of Gibraltar, to Malaga&rsquo;s mix of historic and modern, leaving room for plenty of options.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Strait-of-Gibraltar.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 1: </strong> Ocean Village Marina, on the Point of Gibraltar, is the perfect launch for this yachting excursion. Get settled on the yacht while gazing across the Straits to the coast of North Africa, and take a stroll around the marina&rsquo;s shops and restaurants for any last minute essentials.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Puerto-Banus-Marina.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Days 2 and 3: </strong> Hug the coast as you head north to Marbella, where culture, shopping, and beaches all combine to make a superb destination. Dock at the posh Puerto Banus marina. Shop for a mix of local, handcrafted goods and big fashion names like Gucci, Dior, Carolina Herrera, and Spain&rsquo;s famous Custo Barcelona. Then plan for a scrumptious dinner with Dani Garcia. Think you have seen tableside magic before? High tech and ancient recipes mix here with an exceptional, two-starred Michelin chef to create magnificent works of culinary art. Reservations are suggested to avoid disappointment. A tour of Marbella galleries is also in order, with several standouts. Caroline Lang&rsquo;s landscapes, contemporary artists featured at Yusto/Giner Galleries, and an abundance of fine art dots the coastline. Night brings beach bars alive, as well as nightclubs and casinos, so pack a few stunning pieces for a night on the town. If polo is a passion, make sure you plan to attend either the XI Jerez Cup in May, the XVI Andr&eacute;s Parlad&eacute; Memorial in June, or the Royal Oman Tournament in July at the Santa Maria Polo Club. One of the world&rsquo;s best, there are fabulous VIP facilities, as well as wonderful restaurants and bars nearby, amid world-class sporting events.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"478\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Benalmadenas-Sollo.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 4: </strong> If you&rsquo;ve decided to remain snug in the harbor at Puerto Banus yet one more day, it is perfectly understandable. There&rsquo;s much to see and do. If you&rsquo;d like to move on, an extraordinary experience awaits in Malaga, with stops in Fuengirola, Benalmadena, and Torremolenos. An historic town with castles and Moorish fortresses, Fuengirola is a cultural hub. It is also heavily touristed in season, so cruising on to Benalmadena&rsquo;s superb little gastronomic gem, Sollo might take precedence. Tucked away in the old pueblo, there are only a few precious tables, definitely worth the effort for gourmet palates. Then, sip a sample of some of the region&rsquo;s best wines at Vinoteca los Sentidos. A friendly, fabulous bar, with to-die-for tapas, this tiny Avenue de las Palmas vinoteca is another memorable place. On to Malaga, especially if you&rsquo;re visiting in August for the Feria de Malaga celebrations, bullfights, and sunset festivals at the Real, or in spring for the Film Festival and Holy Week events. Home to both artist Pablo Picasso and film star Antonio Banderas, the city regularly hosts celebrities, and has since its early beginnings in 770 BC, thanks to the Phoenicians. One of the world&rsquo;s oldest cities, the culture is deep, but so is entertainment.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Estepona.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 5: </strong> While much of the Costa del Sol has been discovered, Estepona continues to exhibit the charm of Andalusia. Narrow cobblestone streets, quaint bodegas, bars, shops, lush flowers, and a fishing village feel make the city a pleasant respite with every modern convenience. Pretty, blue-flag beaches, bars, and authentic culinary experiences are abundant, and medieval structures beckon for you to explore.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cordoba-African-Film-Festival.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 6: </strong> At the southernmost point of Spain, the ancient town of Tarifa welcomes all to one of the most interesting destinations in the Mediterranean. From the steps of Tarifa&rsquo;s impressive castles, the view of the North African coastline, just 14 km away, is breathtaking. Surfers make the most of the waves, along with kites and windsurfers, while many watch for dolphins, or simply drink in this luscious ocean environment. The town&rsquo;s Islamic origins are strong, and the market simply wonderful. If your visit coincides, the March events surrounding the Cordoba African Film Festival should be on your agenda, as well as the prevelanet bird migration in fall and spring.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Ocean-Village-Marina1.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 7: </strong> As you head back to Gibraltar, cruise along the coast of El Estrecho Natural Park, past the three beautiful, natural, coves at Cala Arenas, Cala del Paral, and Cala Fuerte, along the uninhabited coastline. Then return to the marina at Ocean Village. If you&rsquo;re just not prepared to give up your yacht, consider adding on another week to explore the North African coastline, or with foresight, add a few days mid-trip to visit Ibiza. Tunisia&rsquo;s souks, mosques, and Carthaginian ruins, plus the 5-star marina and resort at Yasmine Hammamet, sound quite tempting, but so do the season&rsquo;s opening and closing events on the party island, Ibiza.

Through this process, I have discovered 6 ideas for content planning.</p><p> So, to get you brainstorming about your next big hit&hellip;</p><h3> Here are 6 Ideas for Content Planning</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Engage Your Organization</h3><p> Your organization has a wealth of resources. I&rsquo;m not talking about the company assets; I&rsquo;m talking about the human capital used to move your organization forward. All the stakeholders involved with making your organization a success.</p><p> Everyone from employees, board directors and investors all have diverse experiences that can help influence great content.</p><p> Additionally, they already consume various forms of content that will help when brainstorming about new content. All you have to do is ask.</p><h3> 2. Listen on Social Channels</h3><p> You can do more with  <u>  social listening </u>  that  <u>  spying on your competitors </u> . Social media is a great resource you can use to stay up-to-date with what&rsquo;s going on in your industry.</p><p> It will provide you with real-time insight that can spark inspiration for highly relevant content. See what your network is talking about and participate in the conversation by creating content they can amplify.</p><h3> 3. Interview Consumers</h3><p> Your consumers are arguably your most important asset. Why don&rsquo;t you interview them to see what type of content they wish to consume.</p><p> The main objective for any business is to provide for their customers. By interviewing your consumers, it shows that you care about what they want. It also shows that you welcome their participation in your content creation process.</p><h3> 4. Send Out A Survey</h3><p> Your consumers are used to surveys &mdash;whether they like them or not. They understand that organizations strive to provide highly customized offerings. Surveying your consumers is a very efficient way gather feedback.</p><p> Send out a survey that include questions about the content they like to consume. Ask questions about the other blogs or YouTube channel content they consume. You can even inquire about the mediums in which they consume content such as Feedly, Medium, Tumblr, etc..</p><h3> 5. Map Content with SEO</h3><p> Blogging has come easy for me. I started out creating content only to fill my blog with posts.</p><p> You know, to have something there for people to consume.</p><p> I soon learned that optimizing my content to get more readers has everything to do with content and SEO.</p><br /><p> I told myself, the content created going forward should be SEO friendly. Meaning, the SEO tactics I used should be applied consistently across my blog so I can include my blog post in online search results.</p><p> These tactics include mapping my content to keywords that are popular for digital marketing such as content marketing, social media, and digital marketing. These are very broad topics/keywords but it&rsquo;s where I started.</p><p> Now, I am attempting to map my content to more specialized keywords such as digital branding, content aggregation, and social influence to name a few.</p><h3> 6. Map Content with Your Product Launch</h3><p> I saved the best for last.</p><p> Aligning your content around the launch of a new product or services is the best way to plan content. Since consumers value content more and more, organizations have implemented content marketing strategies to convert their audience into customers.</p><p> Having a series of engaging content released around a particular business priority will certainly help alleviate any challenges within the consumer purchase.</p><p> Although mapping content around your product launch seems like an obvious tactic, it can be extremely difficult. It requires you to plan your content well in advance (possibly six months to a year). This can present challenges for organizations try to stay top-of-mind by consistently producing  <u>  relevant content </u> .</p><p> If this sounds like your situation, I suggest throttling the cadence of your relevant content and put more effort into mapping content that will aid in the launch.</p><p> I would love to know your thoughts about this suggestion in the comments section.</p><h3> Final Thought</h3><p> A nice way to organize your content is by monthly or quarterly themes. Each theme should have its own messaging and assets (i.e. images, videos, etc.). For instance, if you have an upcoming theme, be sure to have all the messaging and social planning created before posting.</p><p> This will help you focus on the additional application of the planned content without being concerned with creating more during this time. Happy planning!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 20:41:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 20:41:42.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_BWXv9XX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-ideas-for-your-content-planning/\", \"post_id\": \"5496\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 20:41:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 20:41:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-ideas-for-your-content-planning\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5495\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2491\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439591243935-eaaa35b380f1-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"693\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439918100,"author_id":258,"chart_url":""}

When you received an assignment you didn&rsquo;t like, you could either accept it or quit. There was very little room for negotiation or discussion. </strong></p><p> As a new agent, I worked on two different squads in six months. It is also the FBI&rsquo;s policy to rotate agents to various parts of the country. In the first three years, I was transferred to three different cities.</p><p> It was not easy to pull up roots, disrupt relationships, and start over with each new transfer or assignment. The anxiety level went up because there was nothing but tension and uncertainty ahead of me.</p><p> When we don&rsquo;t know what the future holds, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether we&rsquo;re starting a new job or being transferred across the country&mdash;the fear of change is there.</p><p> The only ones who like change are babies with wet diapers&mdash;and that&rsquo;s because they know what to expect. The rest of us are left trying to understand how to cope with the unexpected in life and the fear that change produces.</p><p> Our resistance to change finds its roots in fear of the unknown.</p><p> Change means moving into our discomfort zone. Psychologists explain that victims of  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/embedded/200909/everything-you-need-know-about-domestic-violence-were-afraid-ask\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  domestic violence </a> are often so afraid of changing the status quo that they stay in abusive relationships rather than risk the unknown. For those who experience continual physical or emotional abuse, the abuse has become their comfort zone. </p><p> This is why it is so hard for them to move out&mdash;it has become familiar, predictable and known. Ironically, moving in the direction of &ldquo;safety&rdquo; is actually moving into their discomfort zone.</p><p> The truth of the matter is that you will never be able to control everything. You need to have faith that things will work out because sometimes what you can&rsquo;t change, ends up changing you and in the process helps you grow as a person.</p><p> Leaders who successfully navigate change know they are empowered because they have resilience, an important component of mental toughness. They are capable of getting through anything.</p><p> Here are 9 tough truths about change. It:</p><h3> 1. Places You Where You Should Be</h3><p> <br/> As crazy as it sounds, every situation teaches you important lessons about yourself and your reaction to your situation. Often, when things are falling apart, they are actually falling into place.</p><h3> 2. Allows You To Leave The Life You Don't Want</h3><p> <br/> Making a big life change is scary. The only thing scarier is not making it and staying in the rut in which you now find yourself.</p><h3> 3. Brings Out True Friends</h3><p> <br/> Talk is cheap so pay attention to which people stick with you during the changes you experience in life. Change brings out the true quality of your relationship in the long term.</p><h3> 4. Exists To Teach You Lessons</h3><p> <br/> Life is full of mystery and every time you experience change, you are better prepared to embrace the adventure of living.</p><h3> 5. Reminds You That You Are Not Always In Control</h3><p> <br/> Surrender can be difficult, but change reminds you that sometimes it&rsquo;s OK to let go.</p><h3> 6. Empowers You To Grow Into Your Full Potential</h3><p> <br/> While you&rsquo;d rather not admit it, the deepest pain you&rsquo;ve experienced in your life has produced the greatest growth. It&rsquo;s the tough and painful choices that end up being the most worthwhile. Just remember that while pain can teach you a lesson, it must also be released.</p><h3> 7. Nudeges You Forward</h3><p> <br/> While you&rsquo;d rather not admit it, the deepest pain you&rsquo;ve experienced in your life has produced the greatest growth. It&rsquo;s the tough and painful choices that end up being the most worthwhile. Just remember that while pain can teach you a lesson, it must also be released.</p><h3> 8. Keeps You From Getting Stuck In The Past</h3><p> <br/> Nostalgia can be a good thing at times, but if it keeps you chained to visions of what you  used  to be, it&rsquo;s time to embrace who you can  become . You risk an empty state of mind if you cannot move beyond a fabled past. By living in the past, you construct self-limiting beliefs about what you can do in the future. </p><h3> 9. Helps You Find Your Higher Self</h3><p> <br/> The deepest part of you will never change. You are created by God to be the person you are. Life&rsquo;s unpredictability becomes easier when you connect with that part of yourself.</p><p> Change can empower you to lead with your personal strengths and a strong mind.</p><p> What have you learned change in your life?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 20:33:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 20:33:57.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_LyqOCO4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/9-tough-truths-about-your-fear-of-change/\", \"post_id\": \"5494\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 20:33:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 20:33:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"9-tough-truths-about-your-fear-of-change\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5493\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2490\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439754389055-9f0855aa82c2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"702\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439898300,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

A family member or friend can sometimes be the best option as they&rsquo;ll be totally honest with you no matter what, but equally someone you meet at a networking event or business organisation like the Chambers of Commerce could be just what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p> Also, your online network shouldn&rsquo;t be discounted. Check out your contacts on the likes of LinkedIn and Twitter for individuals you&rsquo;d love to chat with on a professional level.</p><h3> 3) Put Together A Schedule</h3><p> Once you&rsquo;ve found the perfect mentor and they&rsquo;ve agreed to help you out, it&rsquo;s time to put plans in stone for when you&rsquo;ll meet as without this, things can fizzle out and you won&rsquo;t get the advice you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p> Suggest dates and times for meetings and how regularly you&rsquo;ll get together to see if this fits in with your mentor&rsquo;s schedule, because it&rsquo;s useless having a mentor who&rsquo;s too busy to spend time with you, so it&rsquo;s important that you&rsquo;re both on the same page.</p><h3> 4) Agree On Topics For Discussion</h3><p> Once you&rsquo;ve agreed on a meeting structure and the ball&rsquo;s rolling, it&rsquo;s a good idea to pre-plan discussion topics.</p><p> While this might seem a bit formal and rigid, it&rsquo;s useful because your mentor can then come prepared with some pointers when you meet, and you&rsquo;ll both know what you&rsquo;ll be discussing so you&rsquo;ll never be stuck for things to talk about.</p><p> This also ensures that you get the most out of the relationship because &ndash; while it&rsquo;s nice to build a personal relationship with your mentor &ndash; it&rsquo;s also important to remember why you approached them in the first place, and make sure you do talk (some!) business.</p><p> So there we go, some tips on finding the perfect career mentor.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 20:23:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 20:23:39.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_9l2ltwY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-tips-on-finding-a-career-mentor/\", \"post_id\": \"5492\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 20:23:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 20:23:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-tips-on-finding-a-career-mentor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5491\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2489\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mba-career-mentor-hero.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"662\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439925300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

However, when times are good, it's also often the best time to begin planning for when times may not be so good. As we all know, markets will turn at some point in the future. As such, this post highlights some areas that principals of RIA firms should be looking at when thinking about building an enterprise that can thrive and survive in good and bad market times.In working with over 1,200 investment advisory firms on a monthly basis to help solve compliance, operations, and technology challenges, we've identified six critical areas of an RIA business that principals should be focused on addressing in order to properly prepare for and survive a market downturn: <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=4f8c0079-b031-499a-82c7-c680eba193dd&amp;placement_guid=651da216-62df-4d26-b802-2fc85e1c6463&amp;portal_id=305003&amp;redirect_url=APefjpHXpldFmRbphwupGkJ8k9jdd4I4o9LbYZIa19BWqvRowabZuGNHXByy4wX4R7r_7jvsxjsbc2df0NpRIDj4ySLwNNYkhm7hptkLkVbAnZRdWEfpzRYTNj3wFFfIK3IZYfKVyZGPGzt3Mzgz2LPfWD99n1HXj4oqSF1c4PwfgzjyuAVaMdHQr6tELzDgEOCaslJth7bM4pTHxZ8IV7Q1K7tVxsCpyY8Nps34qKVZoqfXOXkx0sFdBkSrnfkG1wXV4QdzkrvCN21nt-iWcRTAo2Zu_HhJjMf8QnKLvcuJgv4lEITNLZkWAYz483lTSovgHBwwfRZq&amp;hsutk=1a859e8c35c6c8efbb9dc23cdc4de418&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fis-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn-part-1-of-2&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fis-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn-part-1-of-2&amp;pageId=3091884316\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Download Our Free How to Prepare for an RIA Regulatory Exam Checklist  </u>    </a></p><li> <strong>  Fixed vs. Variable Cost Structure: </strong> Today, there are a plethora of outsourcing options available to advisory firms of all sizes. These options include firms that will assist with compliance, technology, or outsourced investment management via an array of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/the-guide-to-online-rias-and-robo-advisors-that-serve-ria-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   turn key asset management platforms (TAMPs)  </a> </u> . We generally observe that RIA firms are carrying too much fixed cost relative to revenue generally due to the desire to continuously hire full time staff members. While a high fixed cost operating structure can produce amazing  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingleverage.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   operating leverage  </a> </u>  during good times, it also can be devastating to an advisory during a downturn. Letting staff members go can be a death blow to company morale and adversely impact the delivery of client service when needed most. When markets become volatile, clients generally need the most hand holding and human touch, yet at that same time the firm is now being forced to let go of staff to preserve profitability.  <strong>  Our recommendation: RIA firms should outsource anything that isn't the firm's core strength. While many outsourcing vendors, particularly TAMPs, charge on a variable cost structure tied to assets under management (AUM) that can lead to reduce operating leverage and profitability during strong markets, a variable cost structure can be a life saver during a rapid market downturn as it quickly allows a firm to realign its cost structure to match its reduced revenue. In addition, consider structuring employee incentive compensation to more closely mirror overall firm performance (e.g. total firm AUM, revenue, etc.). </strong></li><li> <strong>  Stop Selling Investment Performance: </strong> Our firm's president, GJ King, spent a number of years at Goldman Sachs in the private wealth management group. One of his greatest takeaways from the experience was the unique approach that his mentor, a very successful advisor at the firm, during prospect meetings. To begin, the advisor would immediately acknowledge to the prospect that he could not beat the markets, nor was he even particularly special when it came to portfolio management, and if that was what the prospect was looking for, he or she would inevitably be disappointed and should look elsewhere. Instead, he would focus on what he could help the prospect accomplish as it related to financial planning, estate planning, and his or her future legacy and why he, as an advisor, was uniquely positioned to assist. In many ways, the advisor was preaching the merits of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGQVAA.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Advisor's Alpha  </a> </u> , a phrase coined by Vanguard many years back. Suffice to say, this  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/is-sales-or-better-client-retention-the-best-way-to-grow-an-ria-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   advisor's client retention  </a> </u>  over the years has been nothing short of remarkable due to his focus on setting the right client expectations and delivering on them from the beginning.  <strong>  Our Recommendation: Evan an RIA firm that has an impressive investment performance track record should be very cautious in   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/performance-advertising-why-an-ria-firm-should-exercise-caution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    marketing such performance   </a>  </u>   as it's value add to clients. If the markets turn and the investment performance fails to live up to its hype, there's a good chance the firm will lose a sizable number of clients during a downturn leading to a significant and perhaps catastrophic decline in revenue. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Address Client Concentration Risk: </strong> Any client that generates 5% or more of an advisory firm's revenue poses client concentration risk. Like many small businesses, many RIA firms get their start by landing a single or small handful of large clients that leads to great success for the firm. Often these initial client(s) also have referred a number of additional clients to the firm over the years. Thus, the overall influence of a large client is often under estimated by the firm for if the client was to leave, it's possible other clients would follow. Furthermore, at times a large client has negotiated such favorable pricing that the client may not be as profitable as it may seem at first glance.  <strong>  Our Recommendation: From the beginning, an advisory firm should be razor-focused on diversifying its client base. A market downturn leading to reduced revenue from all clients coupled with the loss of a key client and the clients that he or she may influence can be difficult for a firm to recover from. </strong></li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 20:18:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 20:18:09.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_cwkuQvU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn/\", \"post_id\": \"5490\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 20:18:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 20:18:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5489\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2488\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439740895805-9a4c1bb2c006-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"611\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439897400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s one of the first things we look at when considering new software, and frankly, we&rsquo;ve found many programs that claim they&rsquo;ll integrate with our CRM, but they really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;After implementing an<u> <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/feature/uniform-security-and-compliance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ECM system </a></u>in 2007, Rehmann found that &ldquo;the link between our CRM and ECM systems is seamless, which is what makes it so valuable,&rdquo; says Flourry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple enough that it doesn&rsquo;t overwhelm our advisors, but complex enough to do everything we need.&rdquo;Technology Coordinator Katie Skoczylas adds, &ldquo;Our advisors don&rsquo;t want to know the fancy stuff in the background just to find a copy of a letter, they just want to click on a button to open a client file. But we like knowing that when you move a document into the client folder structure of our ECM repository, it&rsquo;s immediately available in our CRM system.&rdquo;She continues, &ldquo;Right away we started using the business process management tools included in our ECM suite for our correspondence, checks and securities logs. For example, we used to have to make two copies of a check, then have 25 support staff from different regions cutting and pasting information into a single Excel file.&rdquo;Now staff scans checks into the ECM system, eliminating both the two copies and the Excel file itself &ndash; as well as a daily process that took 5-10 minutes per check. &ldquo;With our ECM system, the check log literally creates itself. It takes staff less than a minute. All they have to do is scan in the checks and compliance supervisors can review them right from the ECM system.&rdquo;The same goes for the 400 or so pieces of correspondence supervisors need to review every month, which they approve with a digital signature. Skoczylas says, &ldquo;The compliance supervisor looks up a piece of correspondence, highlights it, signs and dates it with a time stamp.&rdquo;Flourry notes that ECM has boosted Rehmann&rsquo;s efficiency so much that the firm has brought on four new advisors in the last year but hasn&rsquo;t had to hire any new administrative staff. &ldquo;When you tell your executives that your administration staff can do something in 20 minutes that used to take four hours, they can appreciate that,&rdquo; she says.<img alt=\"\" height=\"725\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RehmannsCompositeApp.png\" width=\"1200\"/>See Laserfiche in action, schedule a<u> <a href=\"https://info.laserfiche.com/en/schedule-a-laserfiche-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  demo today </a></u>!

We all fail from time to time, but we keep at it because we know that PR works. But what if your PR appears to be striking out more so than not, and you haven&rsquo;t seen any success? There may be some serious issues with your overall PR strategy and tactics that are causing your PR efforts to fail. We&rsquo;re here to walk you through some of the most common mistakes and of course show you how to remedy them.</p><h3> Know Your Audience</h3><p> <br/> This seems like a no brainer, but after years of working with individuals and companies on their PR strategies, we&rsquo;ve learned that you may not know your audience as well as you think. Understanding the ins and outs of your target demographic, what makes them tick, what they do for fun, where they shop, can highlight how you may be missing the mark with your current strategy. If you want to reach them, you have to find the most appropriate mediums to do so. What do they watch on TV? What magazines are they reading? Do they listen to the radio? Who are you really trying to reach?</p><p> Having an in-depth understanding of who your audience is will allow you to hone in on the most effective ways to reach them through media relations, inbound marketing, social media and more. If your PR efforts aren&rsquo;t working, it&rsquo;s likely because you&rsquo;re not using the right keywords or targeting your audience through the most appropriate mediums.</p><h3> Make it a Team Effort</h3><p> <br/> A successful PR plan cannot be created in a vacuum. Understanding what is going on in every department of your organization, from sales to HR and R&amp;D, can drastically change your strategies and tactics. Do you have a new product that your pushing to a new demographic? Does the sales team have some new key initiatives? Every executive should have a solid understanding of the PR strategies and how they are impacted by the rest of the business. Having group buy in should help to hone in on the details of your plan.</p><h3> Pay Attention to the Details</h3><p> <br/> The devil is in the details, especially when it comes to an effective PR strategy. This really comes into play with SEO, content creation, your website, keywords, etc. If you don&rsquo;t have the right keywords, or even understand how your audience is looking for you, you&rsquo;re not going to find them. Your website, blog,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kcdpr.com/nail-your-social-media-outreach-in-15-minutes-a-day/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media  </a> </u>  and more need to be peppered with keywords that will pull your audience in. Beyond keywords, if your website isn&rsquo;t mobile optimized, you have zero chance of being found in Google due to the search engine&rsquo;s new algorithm.</p><h3> Make Sure You Have the Time</h3><p> <br/> As with any sales or marketing initiative, public relations efforts take time, and a lot of it. If you don&rsquo;t have the time to dedicate to media relations, content development, social media and more, your PR strategies and tactics are almost guaranteed to fall flat.  This can be remedied by adjusting your PR plan to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kcdpr.com/the-ultimate-b2b-pr-cheat-sheet/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   realistically fit within the time  </a> </u>  you and your team can dedicate to it, or you can  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kcdpr.com/benefits-of-outsourcing-your-pr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   outsource  </a> </u> , which could have some serious pros for your company.</p><h3> Focus on the Content</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;re going to sound like a broken record, but that&rsquo;s a risk we&rsquo;re willing to take.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kcdpr.com/times-are-changing-how-to-increase-organic-leads-online/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Content is king  </a> </u> . In this digital age, a PR plan is essentially incomplete without some sort of content marketing plan. Whether it&rsquo;s a company blog or bylined articles, content will make all the difference in trying to improve the effectiveness of your PR strategies.</p><p> Realistically,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kcdpr.com/the-5-worst-public-relations-strategies-and-tactics-weve-ever-heard/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   no PR plan is perfect  </a> </u> . But there are most likely some glaring mistakes that you&rsquo;re making or major holes in your plan that are causing you to fail. Make sure to stay on top of your progress by setting concrete and measurable goals for your plan and checking in on them as often as possible. Understanding what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not and tracking your progress will help to improve your PR strategies and tactics over time.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 20:08:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 20:08:53.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_sXZGSJJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-your-pr-plan-isnt-working/\", \"post_id\": \"5485\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 20:08:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 20:08:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-your-pr-plan-isnt-working\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5484\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2486\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439754525045-a9e8393a2692-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"371\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439910000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2433,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Ways to Get Better at Listening","link":"three-ways-to-get-better-at-listening","source_link":null,"content":"<p> What do you think the most important skill of a Top 20% producer is? Persistence? Work ethic? Time management skills? Closing skills? Tenacity? Certainly all of these skills are present with any Top Performer, but what really separates a pro is their ability to truly listen. And I mean the ability to sit through awkward silences, to not jump in and speak when the client or prospect is thinking, and to be O.K., in fact even welcome, those dead silences when it&rsquo;s almost impossible not to say something&hellip;</p><p> So how do you get better at listening? Here are the three top techniques I teach that immediately make you a better listener:</p><p> #1) Get in the habit of hitting your MUTE button immediately after you ask a question OR immediately after your prospect or client begins to speak. This habit will force you to listen and, because you&rsquo;re muted, it even allows you to talk over your prospect because she/he won&rsquo;t hear you!</p><p> The other rule with the MUTE button is to count slowly to 3 after they pause or when you think they are done speaking. You&rsquo;ll be amazed by how they will often fill in the space and complete their thought &ndash; often giving you amazing information you can use to close the sale.</p><p> #2) Use my favorite technique to encourage someone to keep talking. If a prospect says something you don&rsquo;t understand, or if they haven&rsquo;t revealed a buying motive yet, when they stop talking, simply say, &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; I know that sounds too easy, or even a little awkward, but try it and see for yourself how powerful this is.</p><p> Also, make sure your voice goes up at the end of the &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Put a question in your voice as you say this and after you do, make sure and Hit MUTE. If you master just this one technique, you&rsquo;ll be so far ahead of your competition because you&rsquo;ll learn much more from your prospects and clients&hellip;</p><p> #3) Use any of the following statements to encourage your prospects to keep talking:</p><p> &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, come again?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What would have to change for you?&rdquo;</p><p> You see how this goes. The important thing is to ask an open ended question and, after you do, Hit MUTE!</p><p> It took me several years to learn how to truly listen to my prospects and clients, and I used all of the above techniques to help me get really good at it. I will tell you now that I hear things no one else hears. I hear the motive and the meaning behind what they are saying, and if I&rsquo;m not clear, I simply say, &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p><p> Don&rsquo;t take my word for this, instead, try it yourself and see. I guarantee that once you get good at listening, you&rsquo;ll get better at qualifying and closing. And if you don&rsquo;t improve your listening skills, you won&rsquo;t improve in those areas very much or very quickly. Remember, the most important skill of a Top Producer is the ability to truly listen.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 20:00:38.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 20:00:38.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_iom9YM0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-ways-to-get-better-at-listening/\", \"post_id\": \"5483\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 20:00:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 20:00:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-ways-to-get-better-at-listening\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5482\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2485\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439835903938-bd4bc24592dd-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"535\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439901000,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

They have a good relationship with the advisor, and when they get together they like each other as well.</p><p> <u>  Seth Godin </u> , who has written brilliant work on marketing, refers to \" <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tribes-We-Need-You-Lead/dp/1591842336/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293471162&amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tribes  </a> </u> .\" In a Wired magazine  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/02/ted-seth-godin/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   interview  </a> </u> , he refers to a leader&rsquo;s or marketer&rsquo;s role in terms of creating and building a tribe. He describes the process as \"connecting like-minded people and taking them to a place they want to go.\" I will add one more aspect for our discussion &ndash; taking that group to where they want to go the way they want to get there.</p><p> Your target market may not be easy to define in terms of profession, age, family status, membership in a religious or fraternal organization. And that's okay. If you can define where a group of people want to go (which, in our profession should be easy), in the way they want to get there, you will have a good start on how to build your tribe. For many advisors, your tribe may be defined by your style of getting them there. The way you coach people toward their goals, the way you help them organize their financial lives, your particular approach to investment management, may do more to define your target market then the clients&rsquo; professions or net worth.</p><p> Godin points out if  <u>  <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/tribal-manageme.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you do enough for the tribe  </a> </u> , it will grow. And what you can do for the tribe is to connect people with an issue and with each other. What defines your tribe? What are you doing to lead them? Clarify those non-obvious connections, and you may have a powerful idea to drive your marketing plan.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 19:50:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 19:50:15.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_xPfV6ub.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-your-target-market-a-tribe/\", \"post_id\": \"5481\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 19:50:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 19:50:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-your-target-market-a-tribe\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5480\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2484\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iStock_000026351923Medium.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"656\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439899200,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2431,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Financial Security for the Light Sleeper","link":"financial-security-for-the-light-sleeper","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Have you ever had trouble falling asleep, worried about what would happen if you&mdash;fill-in-the-blank with your nightmare&mdash;lost your job, tanked your business, got sick and needed expensive treatment?</p><p> Do those thoughts swim in your subconscious and keep you from fully enjoying your life (or a good night&rsquo;s sleep)? Stop and consider what it would take for you to feel financially secure.</p><p> Of course we all define &ldquo;secure&rdquo; differently.</p><p> Maybe you need money stuffed in your mattress in order to sleep at night.Or you&rsquo;re perfectly content when you can pay your bills without harassing phone calls. It&rsquo;s all a matter of what makes you feel safe.</p><p> So how do you build security?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s start with your career. A successful one is stacked with lots of variables and unknowns, whether you work for yourself or someone else. To maximize your chances of growing your income, consider adopting four key practices:</p><li> Continue to learn and grow. Unless you do the work to keep your skills relevant and meaningful, you can find yourself out of the game. Keep learning meaningful skills and habits.</li><li> Think out of the box. As Marshall Goldsmith says,  &ldquo;What got you here won&rsquo;t get you there.&rdquo;  If your crystal ball is on the blink or you&rsquo;re just too entrenched with today to have an angle on future possibilities, explore different perspectives. Read Fast Company, watch TED talks and other forms of brain candy.</li><li> Know your competition, both internally and externally. What are other professionals, businesses and your colleagues doing? How are they positioning themselves differently and what can you learn from that?</li><li> Track your actions, successes and failures. It&rsquo;s about knowing yourself and being aware of what you are great at&mdash;and what you might need some help with. Understand when your energy is high and when you need a recharge. By keeping a log of your activity, you can see yourself more objectively. One key point: failures taken to heart are killers; it&rsquo;s much more useful to ask yourself what you did well and what you could have done better than to beat yourself up over mistakes. <br/>  </li><p> So your career is chugging along and you&rsquo;re making investments in your future. But financial security also means paying attention to your outflow&mdash;your expenses.</p><p> Think of your expenses in two categories: fixed and discretionary. Fixed costs are your rent or mortgage, taxes, debt payments, utilities, food, etc. While you can control some fixed costs to a degree (i.e. utilities, food, clothing), you have a pretty good idea of what HAS to be paid each month. Almost everything else is discretionary&mdash;vacations, entertainment and anything else that doesn&rsquo;t fall in the category of pure necessity. You want to:</p><li> Know your numbers. Having an idea is not the same as knowing. Understand exactly what it costs to pay your fixed expenses and decide how much of your surplus you&rsquo;re willing to put towards discretionary and how much towards savings.</li><li> Make your savings payments first. Put your target contributions away before you start making discretionary spending choices. Whatever you have left over after all expenses have been paid can be used for additional savings or targeted projects.</li><li> Chart your progress. If you know what you expect to save and spend, project out 3, 6, 9 and 12 months ahead and then test your results. If something&rsquo;s not working at each quarterly review, zero in on what and make adjustments.</li><li> Plan your taxes. Underpaying your obligation can be not only costly from a budgetary standpoint, but you can easily rack up penalties and interest. You can wipe away a sizeable chunk of your savings with a miscalculation of your tax liability. <br/>  </li><p> And finally you want to create a safety net. It&rsquo;s not only a pile of readily available cash, it&rsquo;s insurance that protects you from BIG problems. Because creating security is all about the &ldquo;what if&rsquo;s&rdquo;. In composing your safety net:</p><li> Understand the risks that you are insuring. For example, if you have debt, a young family or an expensive life-style, Disability Income, Life insurance, Liability and Umbrella coverages are all important.</li><li> If you have a great deal of wealth, get yourself enough liability protection. Remember, security is knowing that you have identified where and how an event can have a substantial impact on your life.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t buy into the &ldquo;features and benefits&rdquo; that some insurance brokers lead with. Illustrations of cash value 30 years into the future is like reading fantasy fiction. Ask good questions about internal costs, guarantees and policy limitations and exclusions. Disability insurance is all about the definitions and exclusions&mdash;don&rsquo;t buy coverage until you understand what triggers coverage and what will lead to a denied claim.</li><li> There is no such thing as a &ldquo;rule of thumb&rdquo; when it comes to your emergency fund of cash. The amount that is right for you is dependent on many factors, such as whether you are a one or two person earner family, your fixed costs, how much debt you carry and your occupation or profession. This is an area where being conservative is important.  What if it takes you a year to find a new job? <br/>  </li><p> Financial security is not an impossible dream with the right knowledge and effort. It doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight, but you can start right now and create a plan that helps you put your head on the pillow at night.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 19:44:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 19:44:05.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_BHqKByq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/financial-security-for-the-light-sleeper/\", \"post_id\": \"5479\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 19:44:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 19:44:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"financial-security-for-the-light-sleeper\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5478\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2483\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Financial-Security-for-the-Light-Sleeper.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"673\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439902800,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

And with that also comes dealing with die-hard fans at work. Fandom is great and all, but some people just don&rsquo;t know when to stop ... So avoid doing these annoying acts at work, and maybe you won&rsquo;t walk into the office to find that your computer monitor has been bashed in by a deflated football (oh, the irony).</p><h3> #1. Tailgating at Work </h3><p> No one wants to play beer pong at 2:00 p.m. on a Monday afternoon. No one. So keep those Solo cups away from the meeting table. And while you&rsquo;re at it, grab a shirt too. As much as you want to show off your team&rsquo;s logo painted on your belly, we&rsquo;re pretty sure that goes against any office dress code.</p><h3> #2. Rubbing It in That You&rsquo;re Going to the Game</h3><p> We get it. You&rsquo;re excited that you got tickets to the sold-out game and us plain folk have to watch it at home. Whoop-de-doo. At least we can watch the game in our underwear and not be at risk for indecent exposure.</p><h3> #3. Humblebragging About Going to the Game</h3><p> Oh, so you're drained from going to the game and cheering on your team through victory? All that yelling and &ldquo;whoo-hoo\"ing hurt your delicate throat? Life can sure get rough. Would you like a bottle of milk to accompany your whining?</p><h3> #4. Talking About Prepping Your Fantasy Football League</h3><p> You&rsquo;ve become That Guy who responds to a simple &ldquo;how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so stressed, man. I&rsquo;ve been staying up to scoping out the best players for my fantasy football league.&rdquo; Good for you, I guess? Maybe you and Ms. Humblebrag should get acquainted.</p><h3> #5. Talking About Your Fantasy Football Team ... All Day, Every Day</h3><p> &ldquo;Hey, Joe, how&rsquo;s that report coming along?&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming along, Larry. But my fantasy football team rocked it last night!&rdquo; Joe, we wish we cared more. But honestly, no one wants to hear about your FF team. Go join the 2:00 p.m. Monday beer ponger. You two seem to have a good grip on work appropriateness.</p><h3> #6. Recapping Highlights From SportsCenter</h3><p> Between our Facebook newsfeed, Twitter trends, and every news syndication on this planet, the last thing anyone wants to hear is your recap of last night&rsquo;s SportsCenter. So you can stop giving us all the highlights, lowlights, and anything else in between &mdash; there&rsquo;s a reason why you&rsquo;re not a reporter.</p><h3> #7. Asking People Why They&rsquo;re Not a Football Fan</h3><p> When your coworker says they dislike football, it&rsquo;s equivalent to them saying they hate puppies. And you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;How can this person even sleep at night with such hate?&rdquo; Sorry to break it to you, but some people just don&rsquo;t care about football like you do (or even puppies, for that matter &mdash; what&rsquo;s wrong with you?). </p><h3> #8. Monday Morning Quarterbacking</h3><p> You&rsquo;re such a football expert that if the Seahawks had you as their coach in the Super Bowl, that game-ending play wouldn&rsquo;t have even crossed your mind. As for last night&rsquo;s game, we won&rsquo;t even get you started. And that&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;d get riled up, but because we know you're just BSing.</p><h3> #9. Changing Your Coworker&rsquo;s Desktop Background</h3><p> How dare your coworker have a Steelers wallpaper on her computer? This is Hawk Territory. Don&rsquo;t be That Guy that lurks onto people&rsquo;s computers and ruins security protocol for everyone.</p><h3> #10. Claiming Women Aren&rsquo;t Real Fans</h3><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/football/nfl-hones-message-for-its-female-fans.html?_r=1&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">   N.Y. Times  </a> </u>  reported that women have surpassed men as regular-season viewers.  Who&rsquo;s the real fan now? Enough said.</p><h3> #11. Dissing on the Seahawks</h3><p> Claim as you will that all Seahawks fans are bandwagoners, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that we&rsquo;ve been rocking the NFL world. We&rsquo;ve heard plenty of jeers over the years, and that hasn&rsquo;t slowed our momentum down yet.</p> <p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 19:02:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 19:02:13.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_EMps64z.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-11-most-annoying-things-football-fans-do-at-work/\", \"post_id\": \"5477\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 19:02:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 19:02:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-11-most-annoying-things-football-fans-do-at-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5476\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2482\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/eZAtiRp.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1018\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439920800,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2429,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Worst Money Moves for Near Retirees","link":"10-worst-money-moves-for-near-retirees","source_link":null,"content":"<p> About 10 years ago, I said to my dad, &ldquo;Dad, I think I&rsquo;m done making stupid mistakes.&rdquo; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if I&rsquo;d been right.</p><p> Mistakes are part of life. Some are easier to recover from than others. When it comes to money &mdash; and time &mdash; the closer you are to retirement the less time you have to recover from bad money moves. Don&rsquo;t take any chances.</p><h3> Here are the 10 money moves you need to avoid as you get near retirement:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Invest the same old way </h3><p> The same investment approach that got you this far will work just fine in retirement, right?  <br/> <br/> Maybe, maybe not. When you do your retirement planning right you will know specifically what amount of money needs to come out of which accounts in which calendar years. Suppose you'll begin taking IRA withdrawals first because it will be most tax-efficient to do so, but your younger spouse won't touch their IRA for at least 10 to 15 years? Should both accounts be invested in a similar way? I don't think so. As you near retirement you'll need to spend some time creating an investment approach that aligns each account to its specific goal, cash flow requirements and time frame.</p><h3> 2. Claim Social Security without a strategy </h3><p> If someone deposited an extra $50,000 or $100,000 into your retirement savings, it would make no difference at all to you, right?  <br/> <br/> The right Social Security claiming plan leads to a result that is just like having more retirement savings. People mistakenly think that claiming later means they have to retire later or have less spending money early in retirement. This is not true. Retirement date and claiming date are not synonymous. For many upcoming retirees there will be little-known tax benefits to a delayed Social Security start date combined with early IRA withdrawals or Roth conversions. Married couples, those with a previous marriage that was at least 10 years in length and those with expected retirement incomes less than $90,000 should not even think about claiming without first creating a plan.</p><h3> 3. Avoid tax planning </h3><p> You feel like the government uses your money wisely so there is no reason for you to invest a few hours each year in tax planning, right? After all, who cares if you pay more than you might otherwise have to?  <br/> <br/> One of the most important things you can do as you near retirement is create a multi-year tax projection that shows your expected tax liability each year in retirement by showing you where your expected income will come from, including future estimated required minimum distributions (you must begin taking these from IRA/401k accounts at age 70 1/2), Social Security, and pensions. Once you see what your marginal rate is expected to be each year you can proactively make decisions that can reduce your retirement tax liability. These decisions might involve taking IRA distributions earlier than you thought, funding a Roth IRA instead of your 401(k) plan, or converting IRA assets to a Roth. In my book  <u>  Control Your Retirement Destiny </u>  I devote an entire chapter to the type of tax planning that can increase your after-tax income in retirement. </p><h3> 4. Assume health care is covered </h3><p> You don't need to budget much for health care because once you reach 65 Medicare's got you covered, right?  <br/> <br/> Sorry, it doesn't work that way. Medicare will cover about 50% of your health care expenses in retirement. You'll still have expenses for Medicare Part B and D premiums, dental, eye care, hearing, co-pays, etc. How much will that add up to? At a minimum plan on $400 - $800 per month in health care expenses. For current retirees, statistics show anywhere from 15% - 33% of their income goes toward health care. It's a broad range because costs vary by location and health status.</p><h3> 5. Learn nothing</h3><p> You'll only need to rely on your retirement savings and planning decisions for the next 20 to 30 years. There's no reason to learn much about it, is there?  <br/> <br/> One of the first things I always tell a new client is \"The truth is no one will ever care about your money as much as you do.\" Time invested in your own financial success is worth it. Even if you plan on delegating to a trusted advisor, you need to know enough to find that person in the first place. There are numerous ways to learn: read a book or two, subscribe to financial magazines, or simply spend time on the Internet every week browsing retirement blogs, articles and research papers.</p><h3> 6. Don't track anything </h3><p> Don't track your net worth, spending habits, annual amount you contribute to savings or anything that has to do with your money. This way you won't know if you are making progress toward your goal. It's easier not to know, don't you think?  <br/> <br/> I grew up in the gym. It's common in the gym to see people with notebooks. Why? They know keeping a record of their progress will help them reach their goals. If you have never created a net worth statement or spending plan (budget) you are missing out on a big opportunity. These types of schedules are financial tools that can be used to steadily nudge you toward your goals. You need a plan that outlines your goals and a way to measure your progress toward them.</p><h3> 7. Upsize everything </h3><p> The economy is improving and you want to appear as if you are doing well. You have to spend money to make money right? What will it matter if you put off additional savings for another year or two? You'll make up for it later.  <br/> <br/> The so-called \"wealth effect\" can be a dangerous thing. As your income and account balances go up, you start to relax a bit, which is good, but only to a point. When you find your spending increases are starting to outpace your income increases, you have a problem. And that increase in your account balances because the market did well last year? That does not mean there is now room for the latest model car &mdash; unless that was part of your original plan. When you get an increase in income always allocate a portion of it toward an increase in your savings rate. Once that is done then any excess can be used toward extras.</p><h3> 8. Decrease your emergency fund</h3><p> You only need an emergency fund in case you lose your job. So once you're retired, you can spend that emergency fund on a cool vacation, right?  <br/> <br/> I've yet to work with a single retired client who didn't encounter an emergency, or some form of unforeseen expense, within their first five years of retirement. Most of the time it was something involving an adult child. A few times it was a health care event. And once or twice it was a major home repair. The best retirement plans are those that leave wiggle room for things you can't anticipate. That means the emergency fund is still a needed tool. You are best off having a year's worth of spending tucked away in a safe investment when you reach retirement age. Don't include it as part of your plan. It is there as reserves for the things that will happen that you can't foresee.</p><h3> 9. Take on risk to make up for lost time</h3><p> You got a late start saving for retirement and the stock market has been doing well. You should invest aggressively to make up for lost time, right?</p><p> I frequently see financial advisors use software to illustrate how tweaking an asset allocation will deliver higher returns. This is blasphemous. A more aggressive allocation gives you the potential for higher returns &mdash; along with the potential for lower returns. If you're already running short of your goals, taking on more risk may help, but it's far from a sure thing. Before taking on additional investment risk, consider options that will deliver a more reliable outcome: like working longer, spending less and saving more. If you decide to take on investment risk it should be part of a well diversified plan that insures you wouldn't need to liquidate any of your riskier holdings in the event of a market correction</p><h3> 10. Don't share your plans with the family</h3><p> Your kids understand your retirement plans, your level of financial security, and exactly what they should do if something happens to you, right?  <br/> <br/> Parents spend a lot of time worrying about their kids. Do they realize, their kids worry about them too? Your kids want to know you have a plan. They want to know who to call and how to help if something goes awry. Don't leave it for them to figure it out once you're gone. Involve them now in discussions about beneficiary designations, trusts and health care decisions. One of my fellow RetireMentors, Jack Tatar, has a book called that provides guidance on how adult children can initiate these conversations. But if you're a parent, don't wait for the kids to talk to you. Start the conversation yourself. </p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 18:03:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 18:03:58.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_FENCoym.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-worst-money-moves-for-near-retirees/\", \"post_id\": \"5475\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 18:03:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 18:03:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-worst-money-moves-for-near-retirees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5474\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2481\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-17-at-4.07.35-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"565\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439927100,"author_id":125,"chart_url":""}

While the market is seemingly in the seller&rsquo;s favor, many opt to buy regardless of the housing market&mdash;be it for stability, tax benefits or something else altogether.</p><p> As a financial planner, I often find myself discussing real estate and its impacts on one&rsquo;s financial future. And while there are plenty of reasons to buy, there are also a number arguments supporting renting. Below are a few considerations to keep in mind when faced with that decision.</p><h3> Why Buy?</h3><p> <br/> Sure, the market isn&rsquo;t ideal. In fact, it&rsquo;s one of the worst in the nation for buyers. So why are some people opting to buy now?</p><li> <strong>  Stability. </strong> A home provides a place to live&mdash;stability for you and your family. When you own a home, you are no longer at the mercy of a landlord who changes his/her terms or, even worse, sells the property. There is also something to be said about making that payment and knowing that with each payment you are closer to owning that asset.</li><li> <strong>  No Surprises. </strong> While you can certainly be caught off guard by a leaky roof or a broken water heater, your monthly payment typically will not vary, so you can plan ahead. This helps with budgeting, cash flow and other aspects of a comprehensive financial plan.</li><li> <strong>  Tax Benefits. </strong> Tax breaks from home ownership can be significant. As a home owner, you are able to deduct many home-related expenses. And, unless you owe more than $1 million, all the interest you pay in your mortgage payment is tax deductible.</li><li> <strong>  Diversification. </strong> While real estate hasn&rsquo;t been proven to be the best investment over a long period of time, barely keeping up with inflation, it can serve as a great diversification tool. Consumers commonly invest in stocks, bonds, cash, CD's, etc. through their brokerage and retirement accounts. Real estate is another asset class that can help diversify your investable assets. Plus, as a tangible asset, real estate appeals to many. The key is to diversify and avoid investing solely in real estate.</li><li> <strong>  Building Equity &amp; Retirement Planning. </strong> As a homeowner, you get to build up your equity by paying down the mortgage over the years. If you are successful in paying down your mortgage, you will likely have a lower cost of living in retirement. <br/>  </li><h3> Opting to Rent</h3><p> <br/> While buying a home certainly has its advantages, renting often works better for many. So, if you are in that part of the population who is unable to buy at this time, here are a few good reasons to rent:</p><li> <strong>  Flexibility. </strong> While some people spend most of their lives in one location, there are many who prefer to move around, experience new neighborhoods, cities, etc. It&rsquo;s hard to put a dollar value on that experience and enjoyment. Same goes for one&rsquo;s career&mdash;if you are anticipating a change, it may be best to rent, as buying a home can hinder that flexibility to pick up and move.</li><li> <strong>  Skip Out on Home Ownership Costs. </strong> Homeowners are painfully familiar with the extra and unforeseen costs that come with purchasing and maintaining a home. These include realtor costs, mortgage origination fees, property taxes, HOA fees (if applicable), moving costs, furnishing, decorating, leaky pipes, gardener, you name it. Often times, these costs are higher than people anticipate. As a tenant, you can enjoy the perks of your abode, without having to worry the financial burden of those transactional and ongoing expenses.</li><li> <strong>  Illiquidity. </strong> For obvious reasons, a house isn&rsquo;t something that can generally be turned into cash overnight. Many people invest their life savings into a home, thus putting the bulk of their net worth into an illiquid asset. While there can certainly be benefits to not cashing in on our savings, there is also a risk that comes with tying up a large portion of your wealth into such an asset. Renting allows for flexibility and other investment options for your assets.</li><li> <strong>  Building Credit. </strong> As consumers, we need a healthy credit for pretty much all we do&mdash;getting a new cell phone plan, buying a car, purchasing a home or even renting. While renting doesn&rsquo;t boost credit the same way owning a home often can, creating a history of on-time rental payments can, in some cases, help build your credit to qualify for a mortgage down the road. This history can be created when (and if) your landlord reports your payment data to the credit agencies. Alternatively, there are several third-party services that can help report this information on your behalf. Once your credit is in a good place, you can reevaluate and see if owning a home is right for you.</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-17 17:01:29.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-17 17:01:29.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_Wwd2Jjr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/to-buy-or-not-to-buy/\", \"post_id\": \"5473\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-17 17:01:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-17 17:01:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"to-buy-or-not-to-buy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5472\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2480\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438962136829-452260720431-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"639\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439906400,"author_id":470,"chart_url":""}

Before we cross paths, life is humming along under the guise of normalcy, and then (cue change agent), they enter your life and everything is different.</p><p> Of course, it&rsquo;s not just the &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; that is life changing. We all meet new people every day. Some of them are quite nice and interesting, (and some not so much) but simply meetingsomeone isn&rsquo;t the game changer. What changes the game, is that they see something that you don&rsquo;t. They see possibility in you.</p><h3> &ldquo;Game changers&rdquo; are the people who see possibility in others, when they can&rsquo;t yet see it in themselves.</h3><p> <br/> When I look at the crossroads of my life, they are all marked by the extraordinary professionals who have seen possibility in me. Their names are like mile-markers in my career: Fred, Dave, Gordon, Tim, Michele, Jennifer, Ann, Sherri, Mike, Cecil, Heather, Dani, Mary, Donna, Dana&hellip; I know how fortunate I am. My list is long.

Their Director of Training was sitting in my room, and some point (I really don&rsquo;t remember the context) I had used an example from my colorful theatre days. Being the resourceful guy he is, after leaving my session, the training director sought me out on the internet, learned more about my background, and walked into my classroom the next morning and changed my life. I don&rsquo;t know if that was what he had planned to do (although knowing him, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if he had some awareness around the impact he would have), but that&rsquo;s what he did. He changed my life. He changed my life by seeing possibility in me. That possibility sparked the beginning of OnStage Leadership.</p><p> Since that day, more than a 1,000 people have gone through OnStage Leadership. That possibility is creating a community of leaders who are making a difference in their organizations, in their relationships, and in their lives. That possibility became my life&rsquo;s work. I am forever grateful for his ability to see what is possible. While he is an extraordinary human being, what he did is something that we all have the power to do.

{"original_id":2426,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Step Away From the Abacus… and Get to the Heart of It Instead","link":"step-away-from-the-abacus-and-get-to-the-heart-of-it-instead","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Life is full of surprises. Or so we&rsquo;ve found at this year&rsquo;s seminal financial services event, the FSC Annual Conference. Forget analytics, actuaries and accounting: discussions instead go to the literal and figurative heart of Australia&rsquo;s future wellbeing and our industry&rsquo;s role in supporting it. Here are some highlights to date.</p><p> This year&rsquo;s conference is all about our shared future, as captured by its &ldquo;Visualise&rdquo; theme. Implicit in the proceedings to date is the recognition that, as a nation, we&rsquo;re at (or even past) an inflexion point in our goal of securing long term financial wellbeing for our populace.</p><p> Rising to the challenge posed by this will require new ways of thinking, courage and, above all, positive action.</p><h3> Doing as we&rsquo;ve done in the past will no longer cut it.</h3><p> <br/> Enter the theme of heart and the need to understand and serve the very real human needs of the individual if we&rsquo;re to achieve that bigger picture goal. We&rsquo;re talking real people, with real lives, real aspirations and real fears. It serves all of us well to step back from the abacus and take a moment to appreciate the granular and its role in creating the whole.</p><p> And it doesn&rsquo;t get any more real or more human than journalist Peter Greste, who, released from his 400 days in an Egyptian prison shared with a rapt audience insights into staying sane, productive and positive against the kind of adversity that the vast majority of us can only &hellip; barely &hellip; begin to imagine.</p><p> Against this uplifting and inspiring backdrop, conference attendees have been treated to lively and vital discussions that zero in on the big issues: sustainability of retirement incomes; engaging Australians managing their own financial futures; the true impact of life insurance on ordinary people&rsquo;s lives and so much more.</p><h3> Our industry has never felt more relevant.</h3><p> <br/> Take the next super challenge: decumulation, a.k.a how we are to deal with people taking money out of super when the primary focus to date has been putting money in? The real issue here of course is the unhappy conjunction of an ageing population, inadequate retirement incomes and a diminishing tax base. So, relative to the size and importance of the issue have we really done it justice, with enough lead time, as an industry?</p><p> The first keynote event saw futurist Mark McCrindle, Insight Economics director, Michael Keating and Vanguard&rsquo;s Asia Pacific head of Investments, Rodney Comegys, tackling this question. A key focus? The risks inaction poses to future living standards (you see the human theme here, living standards?).</p><p> Rodney Comegys, when pushed, agreed that it may be because Australia is good at retirement income saving as a nation, that we&rsquo;re not particularly engaged as individuals, either as potential retirees or industry participants thinking about the future.</p><p> Somewhat surprisingly, in answer to &ldquo;should we move to 15% SGC?&rdquo;, one of the founders of the super system, Dr. Michael Keating, says no. In fact, even 12% could be too much, in Keating&rsquo;s view. Accumulation is working well, he says. It&rsquo;s the decumulation piece that&rsquo;s now the priority (there&rsquo;s that inflexion point again).</p><p> Are we, as a nation, innovating retirement income products well enough yet? Always room to improve, was the diplomatic answer from Vanguard. A &lsquo;layer&rsquo; of different options is needed. Once upon a time you retired with a single fund. You chose the asset mix based on your own views about investing or as advised to. Now it&rsquo;s not that simple, so alternatives that provide for a range of contingencies might be smarter &ndash; funds of different types, combined, perhaps, with deferred annuities, longevity insurance, mandatory payout funds &ndash; and of course a well-defined spending policy that doesn&rsquo;t have to radically adjust to differing investment returns but offers flexibility to dial up or down based on changing circumstances.</p><h3> When should planning for all this start? In our 30s and 40s.</h3><p> <br/> Which brings us to another key challenge: how to get us engaged enough in all our financial activities to make a difference and set ourselves up for life.</p><p> Enter life insurance veteran, industry guru and bestselling author  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.josephjordan.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Joe Jordan  </a> </u>  with some insights that caused us to really step away from the abacus to get to the heart of the matter.</p><p> Because, Joe suggests, people have dogged, ill-informed views of what insurance actually does &ndash; or doesn&rsquo;t do. And we are wrong to focus on the facts, rather than the emotions around insurance.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve spent too much time, in financial services, on the analytics, says Joe. What we haven&rsquo;t spent enough time on is understanding how consumers think. Accept this, says Joe:</p><li> <strong>  The way people make financial decisions has not changed </strong></li><li> <strong>  The way we perceive how people make decisions has changed </strong></li><li> <strong>  Expectations matter &hellip; perhaps more than actual outcomes </strong></li><p> <br/> To bring this back to the issue of long term security in retirement, it&rsquo;s reliability of income not return on investment that will matter far more to consumers.</p><p> As an insurer, Joe says, what  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.metlife.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MetLife  </a> </u>  does is simply this: help people have certainty around their income. That may be by replacing it if they die or guaranteeing it if they are sick.</p><p> His research shows that finding out people&rsquo;s personal priorities (there&rsquo;s that human theme again) is far more important than presenting rational, fact-based information showing the lump sum amount a policy may deliver. He presents a great case for actually never talking about the &lsquo;face&rsquo; amount of a policy, but rather the income it will deliver, and at what cost.</p><p> Having voiced our personal priorities (looking after our family, paying off the mortgage, allowing an income for life if we couldn&rsquo;t work) we are far more able to estimate what we really need from our insurance as an income stream, not as a lump sum. (And please note &ndash; these principles apply equally to super.)</p><p> So, says Joe, if you&rsquo;re going to sell protection products you have to develop a culture that&rsquo;s supportive of understanding people&rsquo;s real needs. A culture where people are inspired by the great good that comes from insurance.

Unfortunately, the article did not touch on two very important aspects of preserving wealth: Long-term care and disability insurance.</p><p> When it comes to wealth, keeping it should be as important (if not more) as building it. And while leveraging compounding-interest and smart investment tactics are great, you also need to earn income in order to invest it.</p><p> Further, Americans are living longer and retirees may have another thirty to forty years of vitality left in them. Many risk seeing their investment plans and retirement accounts that they had so carefully grown begin to fall apart when medical needs become a priority.</p><h3> &ldquo;How long can you go without income?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> In the Money article, the author asserts that an investor should have enough money set aside to live for six months without income. Most of the clients our RIAs bring to us follow this same advice, but the real question is what happens when the time without income is longer than six months? A year? Five years?</p><p> <strong>  Disability insurance provides an income if a person can no longer work because of an injury or illness. </strong> Disability insurance policies are flexible, and they depend on the type of work the client does.</p><li> Baseline coverage provides a safety net that can prevent a sudden depletion of assets in the event of a catastrophic illness or injury;</li><li> People who have had extensive training, like doctors or lawyers typically opt for more robust policies since their training and education is very specific;  </li><li> For investment bankers or 'C' executive level positions, they may need coverage for high commissions or bonus structures not covered by employer plans. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Long-term care insurance accomplishes the same goal of protecting the investor&rsquo;s assets, but in different circumstances. </strong> While disability insurance is something almost everyone who works should have, we typically do not recommend obtaining long-term care insurance until someone is in their 50&rsquo;s (unless there are unique circumstances). However, new and innovative products have become available that offer a hybrid of coverage that covers both living health care expenses and after death expenses.</p><p> <strong>  Life insurance with a long-term care rider is often the solution younger people choose as opposed to long-term care insurance. </strong> The advantage to obtaining this type of insurance sooner rather than later is mostly found in the lower premiums younger people pay for life insurance.  </p><p> The only way an insurance plan will actually work is if it is tested under every circumstance.

{"original_id":2424,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Prepare for Productive Sales Meetings","link":"how-to-prepare-for-productive-sales-meetings","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Companies are dependent upon salespeople to represent them well.  </strong> Usually lofty goals are set for sales professionals in terms of revenue to be brought in as well as new clients to bring into the fold.</p><p> Inherently talented salespeople are usually able to overcome the steep goals set for them. But for most in the profession the office displays a revolving door.  In other words, employees enter and quickly leave the company.</p><p> Before you agree to sales training inquire as to the caliber.  Below are comparison between what has been taught and what should be taught.  The idea is to provide insight on how to bring value-add to the meeting that then encourages additional sales.</p><h3> Vocabulary</h3><p> <br/> Most sales trainers launch into providing you with a script.  But there are inherent problems with scripts.  On the client&rsquo;s end, the verbiage may not apply to their business.  On your end, the vocabulary and sentence structure may not suit your style.  A prospect can spot this a mile away and will not give you the time of day.</p><p> <strong>  Sales Lesson:  Speak in your own vocabulary and be authentic.  For interviews, as a sales rep or in your entrepreneurship, research the company first to specifically target your discussion. </strong></p><h3> Hammer the phone</h3><p> <br/> There is usually quite a bit of pressure for new representatives to make many calls per day both by phone and in the field to attain quota.  But similar to a script, repeating the same call after call, frustration sets in and the verbiage begins to make even less sense.</p><p> <strong>  Sales Lesson:  Research each company prior to contacting.  It&rsquo;s a slower process but the results prove it is far more effective. </strong></p><h3> Meeting Push</h3><p> Trainers will advise that you be relentless in pushing for a meeting.  But insistence does not work nearly as well as asking for the prospective client&rsquo;s preferred date and time. </p><p> <strong>  Sales Lesson:  In your own vocabulary suggest &ldquo;now or down the road&hellip;&rdquo;  to obtain a higher number of agreed to appointments. </strong></p><h3> Timeline</h3><p> <br/> Frequently it is taught that a seller needs to ask for the sale several times during conversation.  However, the result of doing this usually annoys the prospect to the extent that the salesperson is asked to never return.</p><p> <strong>  Sales Lesson:  As issues are revealed during meetings, strive to get a timeline as to when the client sees these being resolved.  Due it on their watch not yours. </strong></p><h3> Follow-up</h3><p> <br/> One sales manager actually advised me to call my prospect every single day until they agree to meet to finalize a sale.  Doesn&rsquo;t that sound like stalking someone?  It did to me and I refused to do it.</p><p> <strong>  Sales Lesson:  At the conclusion of a phone call or an initial meeting, ask the person their preference for you to follow-up.  Get specific by also asking morning or afternoon and how they would like to be contacted eg. email or phone call. </strong></p><p> Following these guidelines will lead you to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smoothsale.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smooth Sale!  </a> </u></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-16 20:21:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-16 20:21:13.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_he9XreV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-prepare-for-productive-sales-meetings/\", \"post_id\": \"5465\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-16 20:21:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-16 20:21:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-prepare-for-productive-sales-meetings\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5464\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2476\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-16-at-1.28.10-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"447\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439830800,"author_id":161,"chart_url":""}

So many blogs talk about how banks don&rsquo;t do this, don&rsquo;t do that; fail at this, fail at that; have no idea, cannot change; are stuck in the past or have their heads up their arse.C&rsquo;mon guys.  Do any of you, or us, really believe this?  Does anyone seriously believe that the day someone joins a bank, they have their brain removed?  Does anyone believe that you can rise to the senior management of a bank and have no clue?  Does anyone seriously think that a bank CEO has no idea?<h3> These are intelligent people.  These are intelligent businesses.</h3>So to say that bankers are stupid, clueless and are ignoring the challenges they face, underestimates the banks and shows the absurdity of the author&rsquo;s thinking.In reality, every bank executive I meet is concerned about their future.  They recognise that the traditional structures of banking are changing; that their margins, and therefore profits, are disappearing; that they need to move from physical to digital; that Fintech is changing the market for good; that peer-to-peer, mobile and blockchain are key; that &hellip; well, you get the idea.<h3> Their problem is that they don&rsquo;t know what to do about it and consultants cannot tell them.</h3>They tell me they have spoken with the big consulting firms and that they are as much at a loss to all of this change as they are.  It reminded me of the moment in 2006 I heard that YouTube had been bought by Google for $1.65 billion.  In a presentation made a year later, the story was told of how the then CEO of McKinsey called in his global team and asked them what YouTube was.  None of them knew or had even heard of it, because they were <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2012/11/can-banks-meet-the-hybrid-challenge.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  firewalled out </u> .</a>In other words, we are living in fast cycle change where many bankers &ndash; and consultants &ndash; are finding it hard to keep up.  Right now, by way of example, we see a mega battle playing out between Stripe and Klarna and yet most bank executives haven&rsquo;t heard of either company, even though they are core to <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/07/fintech-attacks-whilst-bank-cxos-snooze.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  their business </u> .</a>This is because of the very nature of <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/08/do-you-believe-in-unicorns.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Unicorns </a></u>.  Unicorns can appear within months and suddenly eat into our space.  A great example is Venmo which, if it were an independent company and not now part of PayPal, would be a Unicorn.  Venmo appeared as a result of a fun weekend amongst two developer millennials because one of the two friends forgot his <u> <a href=\"http://kortina.net/essays/origins-of-venmo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  checkbook </a></u>.  Now, just four years later, Venmo&rsquo;s processing power is doubling year on year ($700 million processed Q3 2014 vs $1.6 billion <u> <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/tomgara/people-sent-16-billion-over-venmo-in-the-last-three-months#.wr3yq6MRZ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Q2 2015 </a></u>) because it was designed by millennials for millennials and understands that developments can take place in hours (don&rsquo;t even consider months).Source: <u> <a href=\"http://letstalkpayments.com/venmo-quarterly-growth-slows-base-grows/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Let&rsquo;s Talk Payments </a></u>This is the age of real-time almost free instantaneous change, and it&rsquo;s hard for the overnight batch analogue generation to keep up. That&rsquo;s why bankers don&rsquo;t need to hire consultants or millennials.  They just need to make sure they have a living, breathing culture of digital innovation.I guess it was best wrapped up by a bank CEO yesterday who asked me, if I were in his shoes, what would be the first three things I would do.  He runs a bank that is challenged by change, offers consumer loans, worries about P2P lending and distributes through branches.I said to him that he firstly needs to build a vision based upon the premise that they will never see the customer face-to-face, only deal through screens and make no margin on their loans.  I said that this vision needs to assume the consumer can get everything he does today for free elsewhere.  Based upon this supposition: how is he going to make money?You make money by delivering value in new forms, such as the Brazilian bank that is crowdfunding bulk buying of new cars in order to secure major discounts for their customers &ndash; and giving them competitive loans in the process.  Like the Ukrainian bank that is overcoming the concerns about buying goods online by creating their own version of Amazon/Alibaba where you buy the goods online in the bank branch or at home and the goods are delivered to a secure locker in the bank branch.  You only pay when you&rsquo;re happy with the product and, as that happens to be when you&rsquo;re in the bank branch, you can get a loan too.These are the new models of banking where value is created through ancillary services to financial products, but not by the financial product itself.

{"original_id":2421,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are Social Security Payments at Risk?","link":"are-social-security-payments-at-risk","source_link":null,"content":"<p> With the presidential election season in full swing the topic of \"how to fix social security\" is certainly on every candidate's agenda and rightly so.  However, at present, the most critical issue regarding social security is the viability of the social security disability fund. <br/> <br/> By way of background, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) fund and the Disability Insurance (DI) fund together make up what is known as the Social Security Trust Funds. Retirement benefits are paid out of the OASI Trust Fund while benefits paid to disabled workers are paid from the DI Trust Fund.</p><h3> As of today, an astounding 60 million Americans receive benefits from social security.</h3><p> <br/> That represents nearly 20% of the U.S. population! Furthermore these numbers are expected to continue to rise as the wave of baby boomers reach retirement age and life expectancies continue to increase. <br/> <br/> It is important to note however that, of the 60 million social security beneficiaries, 11 million receive disability benefits and therein lies the more pressing issue at hand. Specifically, the social security disability trust fund is expected to run out of funds sometime in 2016. <br/> <br/> If that were to happen does that mean that beneficiaries would immediately stop receiving their social security disability checks? No but it does mean that they will see a reduction in their benefits of approximately 19%. The reason their benefits would not stop completely is that their benefits would continue to be funded from current tax revenue coming in from employee payroll taxes.  Since a social security disability beneficiary receives on average $1,017 per month they can expect their monthly check to automatically drop to about $824. <br/> <br/> It should be noted however that the anticipated depletion of the social security trust fund is not a rare occurrence. This circumstance has happened a number of times in the past and the resolution has always been the same. Congress authorizes a shift of funds from the social security retirement fund to the social security disability fund. In fact, this procedural fix has been so common that it is all but automatic. The problem this time is that even this automatic procedural fix has been politicized with opposition from members of Congress in order to put pressure on Congress to try and force a permanent fix to the issue of social security funding before allowing this historically acceptable fix from being approved. <br/> <br/> Once again, the American people (in this case disabled Americans) are caught in the middle of a political debate which often escalates into non-sensical banter with no meaningful collaboration to solve one of the countries most pressing financial issues. <br/> <br/> One proposed solution to remove some of the political wrangling from the process would be to combine the social security retirement fund and the disability fund. This would have little impact on the viability of the retirement fund and would remove the inevitable future battles over when and how to use the retirement fund to provide short term financial support for the disability fund.</p><h3> The viability of both social security funds are indeed at risk.</h3><p> <br/> If Congress cannot agree on acceptable and effective changes to the system the social security trust fund is expected to run out of money in 2035 at which time retirement benefits would be reduced by 25% for all recipients. On-going payroll tax receipts would provide for continued benefits, albeit reduced. <br/> <br/> So what can be done to resolve the issues potentially crippling the social security system? There are numerous possible solutions including, but not limited to, pushing out the full retirement age for younger Americans from 67 to 68 or even 69. Perhaps increasing the social security taxable wage base from today's $118,500 to say $150,000 so that higher income earners pay more into the system. Possibly reducing cost of living increases by 1% or perhaps increasing the social security payroll tax from 6.2% to 6.5%. Certainly numerous possible solutions have been proposed but it's up to our elected officials to work together to develop and agree on a strategy and move forward. <br/> <br/> The question is likely not if changes will be made but which changes can be agreed upon and how and when should they be implemented. Fortunately with a presidential election around the corner we all have an opportunity to let our voices be heard. None of these changes are likely to be easy but they are necessary in order to ensure that social security will be there for the tens of millions of Americans in or approaching retirement.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-16 19:17:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-16 19:17:59.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_8O3LvrS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-social-security-payments-at-risk/\", \"post_id\": \"5459\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-16 19:17:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-16 19:17:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-social-security-payments-at-risk\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5458\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2473\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-16-at-12.32.44-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"515\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439913600,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}

If the founders refuse to accept this, they will stunt the business and may even destroy it.  But even among the founders who can accept that they themselves need to do something, few know how to tackle changing their own roles and relationships.\"  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/catch-22-changing-business-owners-role#Reference1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  1 </a>   - Peter Drucker</p><p> <strong>  ​Tackling the challenge of changing one's role in any relationship is not easy and businesses are no exception.   </strong> Yes, as advisors to business owners, we can be the catalyst to help our business-owner clients make the change that they must make to build transferable value in their companies.  </p><p> If owners tell you (as 58 percent of owners did in BEI's Owner Survey <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/catch-22-changing-business-owners-role#Reference2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ﻿2﻿ </a> ) that they don't have time to engage in Exit Planning, one can assume that almost every one of their waking moments is devoted to the operation of their businesses.  For them, the old saying, \"How can I drain the swamp when I'm up to my armpits in alligators?\" is the motto they live by.</p><p> <strong>  This presents a seemingly insurmountable problem:   </strong> To exit successfully almost all owners rely on the sale proceeds from the transfer of a valuable company, whether it is by sale to a third party or a transfer to insiders.  But to buyers, a company is valuable only if it can operate with minimal disruption to cash flow without the presence of its owner.  In other words, the very definition of transferable value implies that owners must be \"dispensable.\"  If owners are up to their armpits in alligators, they hardly meet the definition of dispensable, yet they feel they have no time available to work on making the company less dependent on their efforts.</p><h3> This reminds us of a Catch-22:</h3><p> <br/> If owners can't break away for the time it takes to plan and act for themselves and their business' future, how can they become dispensable to the success of their companies?</p><p> But unlike the classic Catch-22, a situation in which someone is in need of something (time to plan to create transferable value) that can only be had by not needing it (because they've already planned), there is a way to avoid its application to Exit Planning.  That solution is to bring in an outside force so that the owner doesn't need to take time until she has time.  That force is an outside advisor.</p><h3> Once again Peter Drucker shows us the way:  </h3><p> <br/> \"The founder does need people with whom he can discuss basic decisions and to whom he listens. Such people are rarely to be found within the enterprise. Somebody has to challenge the founders' appraisal of the needs of the venture, and of his own personal strengths.\" <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/catch-22-changing-business-owners-role#Reference3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  3 </a></p><p> How do we, as advisors, challenge and convince owners of the need to act to change their role in and the relationship to their businesses?</p><p> When an owner feels overburdened and crunched for time, suggesting that he or she must take action now to reduce their role is ineffective (and may be dangerous!).  As Exit Planning advisors our role is to:</p><li> <strong>  Provide owners a reason they should take time to engage in Exit Planning (transferable value). </strong></li><li> <strong>  Work with owners to implements a plan to grow transferable value that relies chiefly on the efforts of others, not the owner. </strong>  Explain that, at least initially, they won't have to perform all the value-growing actions (remember, they are up to their armpits)--someone else will.</li><li> <strong>  Highlight that the result of these actions will be to free up their valuable time. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Include in that value-building plan a process to change their role in and relationship to the business. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Then What?</h3><p> <br/> Of course, allowing key employees and perhaps outside advisors to take on some of an owner's duties requires owners to develop role-changing/transferable-value-building attitudes.  We'll look at those attitudes in next week's article, but they include:</p><li> <strong>  A willingness to delegate meaningful duties to top management. </strong>  This requires owners to surrender or at least share control over many facets of their business operations.</li><li> <strong>  A willingness to involve outside advisors to help improve business operations, procedures, process, and planning. </strong> This requires owners to accept outside advice and implement it.</li><li> <strong>  Openness to an objective assessment of the capabilities of the existing management team to take the business to the next level. </strong>  In many companies, the management team rises through the ranks and there is a high degree of loyalty between owner and management. This loyalty blinds owners to the need ot objectively assess management performance on an ongoing basis, and to insist upon best-in-class performance.  Outside advisors can be invaluable in ensuring that the company has the best management team to move the company forward.</li><li> <strong>  An ability to constantly focus on strengthening value drivers executed through others--management team members and outside advisors. </strong></li><br/>References<br/>1.Drucker, Peter F., The Essential Drucker, HarperCollins, 2001, p. 156<br/>2.BEI's North American Business Owner Survey, 2014<br/>​3.Ibid.

It is, in fact, too easy for many of us to think that we are not qualified for the job we have always wanted to have. <strong>  Well, sometimes this can be true, but there will be times it isn&rsquo;t. </strong></p><p> If you feel that you&rsquo;ve got nothing to offer to the company you want to be part of, there is a possibility that you&rsquo;re totally wrong.</p><h3> Here are some reasons why you may actually be more than qualified for the job you want:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. You are passionate about the job.</h3><p> Passion is a very important yet rare characteristic of job seekers. Many job searchers apply for jobs just for the sake of it, and just to earn money. If you are truly enthusiastic and passionate about a job or working in a particular company, it could be your best weapon to land the job.</p><p> Passion is seen by employees as an assurance that you will be dedicated to your job more than anyone else. It is also what you need to be able to do whatever it takes to last and succeed in your chosen career.</p><h3> 2. You&rsquo;ve got fresh ideas.</h3><p> Companies are always in search for people who can bring some new and better ideas for the company. They don&rsquo;t like wasting time and money on people who know nothing new about how the business should be run.</p><p> Even if you are an inexperienced newbie, there are things that you know that nobody else knows. Thus, it is important that you convey this message to a potential employer through your resume and during the interview.</p><h3> 3. You are very flexible and you can adapt quickly.</h3><p> If you are someone who doesn&rsquo;t struggle to adjust to new roles, meet new demands, or work with any kind of personality, you are definitely an ideal candidate for any job. You have to remember that technical skills can be learned, and you can undergo training to develop those skills you still lack. Adaptability, however, is something that cannot be taught, and so companies always want to hire people who can easily make adjustments in order to fit in the environment they are in.</p><h3> 4. You have transferable skills.</h3><p> Transferable skills are highly desirable to any employer of any company. These soft skills are often innate to an individual, although they can also be learned and developed. It&rsquo;s important that that when you <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   do your career planning  </a> </u> , you evaluate your own skills, and indicate in your application documents the important transferable skills you have.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-16 18:34:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-16 18:34:02.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_5PU0L7e.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-reasons-you-should-believe-you-are-qualified-for-a-job/\", \"post_id\": \"5453\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-16 18:34:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-16 18:34:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-reasons-you-should-believe-you-are-qualified-for-a-job\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5452\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2470\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-16-at-11.36.21-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"670\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439823600,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}

But let&rsquo;s not get the cart before the horse. <strong>  Before you go out and spend money on the next big CEM or SaaS tool, there are two basic principles you need to work on: </strong></p><li> A Deep Understanding of Your Audience</li><li> A Crystal-Clear Value Proposition <br/>  </li><p> If this sounds like Marketing 101 to you, well, you&rsquo;re right. But you&rsquo;d be surprised how many brands throw these tried and true principles out the window in favor of the next &ldquo;big idea.&rdquo; After all, this is a new era, right? Isn&rsquo;t exploding technology turning marketing on its head?</p><p> <strong>  Yes and no. </strong> It&rsquo;s true that we&rsquo;re charting new ground when it comes to social connection and engagement, and technology is changing so fast it&rsquo;s hard to keep up. In this environment it&rsquo;s easy to feel you&rsquo;re getting left behind; however, the truth is that we&rsquo;re all people being carried by the same current. Rather than desperately grasping at every new tool that floats by, it pays to do something counter-intuitive: relax, observe and think.</p><h3> Who is your audience (really)?</h3><p> <br/> Today&rsquo;s technologies allow us a myriad of ways to listen to our audiences and learn about their pains, passions and preferences. But do we do it? Not as well as we should. We get caught up in &ldquo;big data,&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t often look deeper. Take a leaf from the old-school books on direct response marketing and spend quality time listening to what your audience has to say. Where do they hang out? What are their dreams? What are their problems? How do they live, play and work? What are the social issues that matter most to them? Unlike the &ldquo;focus group&rdquo; marketing of yesteryear, social platforms have brought this type of listening to a whole new level if we&rsquo;ll just use them.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve talked before about manually  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/lets-concentrate-on-learn-learn-vs-win-win/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   digging into people&rsquo;s social profiles  </a> </u>  to learn more about them. When brands direct more resources to this type of listening, they gain much greater understanding of their customers and prospects as individuals with hopes, dreams and everyday problems. It&rsquo;s this knowledge that helps them scale connectivity and engagement, and allows them to create the memorable experiences their audience wants to share.</p><h3> Why should your audience listen to you?</h3><p> <br/> Today&rsquo;s consumer is busy, distracted and a little overwhelmed with technology, so once you get to know them, spend time thinking about how you help them. If we spent more time asking ourselves &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;How can I sell?&rdquo; we would be a lot better off.</p><p> <strong>  What makes your brand special? </strong> What is it about what you offer (or the way you offer it) that makes people sit up and take notice? Better yet, what makes their experiences with your brand unique? When you know your audience well enough to understand their motivations and empathize with them, it&rsquo;s much easier to distill your unique value proposition. Having a crystal-clear vision of your value helps your brand in two ways. It helps you create content that will attract your audience, and gives your employees a mission standard for ensuring that all experiences with your brand are exceptional.</p><p> Listening to your audience and using what you learn to develop a clear mission and value statement will help you put strategy before tactics&mdash;a big advantage in a rapidly changing environment. <strong>  So before jumping at the next tactic in the technology stream, make sure you are using the tools you already have to answer the #WSILTY question first. </strong></p><p> This post originally appeared on <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ted Rubin  </a> </u></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-16 18:24:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-16 18:24:33.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_gC4jGDk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/customers-to-brands-why-should-i-listen-to-you-wsilty/\", \"post_id\": \"5451\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-16 18:24:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-16 18:24:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"customers-to-brands-why-should-i-listen-to-you-wsilty\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5450\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2469\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-16-at-11.26.46-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"625\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439838000,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2417,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Hanging on to Problem People for Too Long","link":"hanging-on-to-problem-people-for-too-long","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You want to give a struggling or difficult employee the right chances to turn things around. <strong>  Yet when the wish or hope you (and/or they) can change keeps them around for too long, it does more harm than good: </strong></p><li> You spend too much of your valuable time/energy on them and the problems they cause.</li><li> Your best people suffer as they see you avoiding the inevitable, and they may leave your organization.</li><li> Your struggling employee is under stress from negative feedback and diminishing colleague support.</li><p> <br/> In smaller organizations, the disruption cost of holding on to a chronic low performer or problem person is particularly brutal&mdash;it&rsquo;s not like the issue has anywhere to hide. In large organizations, they can create pockets of significant disruption and may even cause real nightmares. Even so, the most seasoned leaders hold on for many seemingly good reasons.</p><p> Below I&rsquo;ve presented the most common ones (gleaned from three decades of my own experiences as an exec and executive coach), and suggest several steps you may want to consider.</p><h3> Top 7 Reasons We Hang on to Problem People</h3><p> <br/> As you read through them, consider that usually more than one is going on at the same time, and the more that are \"true\" for you, the harder it will be to take the necessary action. Check them out and see if any of them are familiar to you or true of a manager/leader you may know:</p><h3> 1. Being overly optimistic about their ability to change.</h3><p> If you&rsquo;re a good leader, chances are you have a fairly optimistic mindset; you see possibilities where others see only problems. Apply that positivity to chronic underperformers and it works against you. You may be saying to yourself, \"Maybe if I give it more time,\" or \"Maybe I'm not helping them enough,\" and things can go on for too long.</p><h3> 2. Avoiding a conflict or painful situation.</h3><p> Even for some tenured, successful CEO&rsquo;s I know, the prospect of having a conversation where performance or fit has become an irreconcilable or prolonged problem can be daunting. It can almost be like breaking up with a spouse or partner. People simply don&rsquo;t want to do it, particularly if the person is well-liked.</p><h3> 3. Finding and recruiting a replacement is hard.</h3><p> Whether you have to make a case internally for a replacement req, or go through an internal/external recruiting process, or you have doubts about your ability to select and hire the &ldquo;right&rdquo; person, finding a replacement is difficult and time-consuming.</p><h3> 4. Not wanting to take on their work.</h3><p> Face it, we&rsquo;re all super-busy, and the prospect of taking on someone&rsquo;s work yourself, or assigning it to one of your team, is off-putting. Some elect to hang on to a problem person rather than deal with the additional work for the time it may take to justify and/or find a replacement.</p><h3> 5. Reluctance to admit a failure.</h3><p> Whether you&rsquo;ve recruited the person and feel it would reflect on you badly that they didn&rsquo;t work out, or they&rsquo;ve worked for you for a long time, and your relationship is otherwise strong, having to fire or exit someone, it can be seen as your own failure, one that can be a hard pill to swallow.</p><h3> 6. Belief that they are irreplaceable or holding something together.</h3><p> They may have deep specialized knowledge that others lack, or manage a business, region, or set of functions that others don&rsquo;t know, or they are particularly beloved by their team, it can be seductive to imagine that they are the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; holding things together, and without them (even despite their prolonged underperformance) things will come apart.</p><h3> 7. Loyalty or humanity.</h3><p> Maybe you like them, they like you, or both. Perhaps you worry about their family, livelihood future, or the emotional impact of a job loss. It&rsquo;s both understandable and admirable that you would care about someone on your team, although if they are wrong for the role or not delivering results for a prolonged time period, chances are good a) it's going to have to happen, and b) their issues are a problem for their colleagues/your other people too.</p><h3> What to do about it</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Support their development for a set period of time.</h3><p> Best case scenario is that the problem person can learn, grown and/or change. Usually, though, we change when WE are ready to change, and not when others think we should.  It's good to support any potential positive change for them by offering the resources in your power to help them improve. It&rsquo;s also important to set a time frame around this, and stick with it.</p><h3> 2. Seek advice and counsel to hold you accountable to that time frame.</h3><p> Get help knowing when the time is up, and holding you to that. I&rsquo;m not recommending you fire someone with a long and successful career who&rsquo;s had a few bad months or quarters. Yet once a reasonable time has passed, and the problem persists, it&rsquo;s time you help them find a better professional situation.</p><h3> 3. Help them find a better situation.</h3><p> I will never forget when Carol, my boss 25 years ago, changed my life for the better by laying me off. She proactively made calls for me, made recommendations, and helped me take a great step in my career &ndash; ultimately one much better suited to my strengths. Take a lesson from Carol: if you value them, don&rsquo;t dump them without support &ndash; put your own time in to help them land in a good situation, as you would someone you care about.</p><p> <strong>  Recognizing your pattern of holding on too long, and helping all involved by making a positive&mdash;if difficult&mdash;change is not only good for you and your organization, but it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. </strong></p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-16 18:00:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-16 18:00:27.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_q0vlve9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/hanging-on-to-problem-people-for-too-long/\", \"post_id\": \"5449\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-16 18:00:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-16 18:00:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"hanging-on-to-problem-people-for-too-long\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5448\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2468\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-16-at-11.12.35-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"506\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439814600,"author_id":131,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2416,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Retirement Reality","link":"retirement-reality","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  What does \"retirement\" mean to you? Here's a brief mental exercise to try: </strong></p><h3> Quickly, without stopping to think, write down what comes to mind when you imagine yourself being retired.</h3><p> <br/> If you're 40 or younger, your answers might well include terms like \"future\" and \"old age,\" which probably don't seem especially relevant or urgent at this stage in your life.</p><p> If you're older, chances are you've had at least passing thoughts about retirement. You might associate it with concepts like these:</p><li> Freedom from the daily grind</li><li> Losing my earning power</li><li> Losing my identity</li><li> Enjoying financial independence</li><li> Being useless</li><li> Dependency and declining health</li><li> Doing what I've always wanted to do</li><li> I don't ever plan to retire</li><p> <br/> Both the positives and negatives in the above list have one thing in common: they don't tell the whole story. The idea of retirement is surrounded by a host of delusions, assumptions, and fears. Many of our expectations about it do not match the reality.</p><p> Here are just two examples from \" <u>  The 2013 Risks and Process of Retirement Survey </u> ,\" done by the Society of Actuaries.</p><li> <strong>  Of the pre-retirees surveyed, 38% expected to work until at least 65. </strong> Another 15% expected not to retire at all. Yet 54% of the retirees surveyed had retired before age 60.</li><li> <strong>  Many pre-retirees&mdash;59%&mdash;planned to stop working gradually. </strong> Yet only 22% of retirees had done so. While 35% of pre-retirees intended to keep working part-time, only 10% of retirees actually did. </li><p> <br/> It's no wonder that many workers plan to stay employed; they'll need the money. The <u>  <a href=\"http://www.transamericacenter.org/docs/default-source/resources/center-research/16th-annual/tcrs2015_sr_retirement_throughout_the_ages.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Transamerica Retirement Survey of Workers  </a> </u> estimates the median amount that workers in their 50s have saved for retirement at only $117,000. For workers in their 60s and older, it is $172,000. Even combined with Social Security, that's hardly enough to provide an adequate retirement income.</p><p> Yet even if you intend to keep working and earning until you're 80, you may find your plans derailed. If companies downsize, older workers may be among the first to be laid off. Health problems (your own or those of family members you may need to care for) can force you to retire earlier than you expected to. And these are only two of the unfortunate realities that can jolt any of us out of our rosy expectations of enjoying a carefree retirement of good health, comfort, and independence.</p><p> Just because we can't count on carrying out our retirement plans, though, doesn't mean we should give up on retirement planning altogether.</p><h3> Here are a few suggestions to deal with the realities of retirement:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Save as much as you can. </strong> Make funding retirement your priority, especially if it's too late to start early. Cut your spending, downsize, and pay off debt. Having more money in retirement gives you more options when bad things do happen.</p><p> <strong>  2. Improve your health: </strong> lose weight, exercise more, and eat a healthy diet. Improve your odds for staying well by changing what is within your power to change.</p><p> <strong>  3. Look at the whole retirement picture. </strong> Become willing to consider both the negative and positive possibilities in order to plan appropriately. Unreasonable pessimism and fear are no more realistic than unreasonable optimism. </p><p> Finally, the most realistic viewpoint may be accepting that retirement is no more or less predictable than any other stage of life. <strong>  We can't know if we'll develop serious health problems in our 70s or still be able to go dancing when we're 102. </strong> While we can and should prepare for the future, we also serve ourselves well when we remember to enjoy the present.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-16 17:54:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-16 17:54:07.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_BLG5iux.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/retirement-reality/\", \"post_id\": \"5447\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-16 17:54:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-16 17:54:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"retirement-reality\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5446\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2467\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-16-at-11.17.38-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"475\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439811000,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

While a phone call, face to face opportunity, seminar and even conference call helps you initiate a new relationship an effective drip email process helps to maintain and elevate that relationship with just the click of your key board.</p><p> The challenge is with so many emails filling an inbox you must make your drip email something people want to open and I will tell you right now a standard market update doesn&rsquo;t cut it.</p><h3> So I wanted to give you a taste of 5 different ways you can use drip emails to get more attention and generate more interest.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Make it personal &ndash; Always share a little something about you or an experience you encountered to make the attached article more relevant. </strong></p><p> Dear client,</p><p> You know I&rsquo;ve been hearing and reading about this recession but when I want to the mall with my family this past weekend we couldn&rsquo;t even find a parking spot! I thought if everyone is struggling then why is the mall full of shoppers???</p><p> This article really helped clarify this new phenomenon and thought it would clear things up for you too&hellip;.</p><p> <strong>  2.  Add Value &ndash; Providing a quick and easy checklist that can help your clients, prospects, friends and family identify whether they have taken the necessary steps to address a financial issue not only engages them in the email but also inspires potential opportunities. </strong></p><p> Dear (name)</p><p> I&rsquo;m often asked &ldquo;What are the 5 most important steps to achieving financial security?&rdquo;  So I decided to share it with all of you. While these aren&rsquo;t the only things you can and should do they are certainly the first steps and should become the foundation to a successful financial plan.</p><p> Make sure you can check off everything on this list:</p><p> <strong>  List 5 key items for example: </strong></p><li> Reduce your debt to __% of your total net worth</li><li> Increase your 401 K contributions to &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</li><li> Have a 3, 5 and 10 year plan&hellip;&hellip; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3.  Provide a quiz &ndash; Provide a short quiz which allows the recipient to evaluate their acumen or determine their level of progress in a certain aspect of wealth management.  This quiz approach can often encourage the recipient to recognize their gaps or deficiencies within that particular area.  This new awareness can potentially motivate them to call your office and schedule an appointment. </strong></p><p> For example:</p><p> How investment savvy are you?</p><p> Quiz</p><p> Rate your answers on a scale of 1 &ndash; 5 and total your scores at the end. </p><li> I know exactly how much money I need when I retire to maintain my current lifestyle    ____</li><li> I have a plan for retirement and am completely on track to achieve my goals                   ____</li><li> If I should pass away I am confident my spouse will be ready to manage the finances      ____ <br/>  </li><p> I think you get the point.  You can also make if fun by adding some humor to the answer key or incorporate a bit of your own personality into both the questions and the answer key.</p><p> <strong>  4.  Make it a real story &ndash; Use situations that you have experienced working with clients (changing the names and some details of course) these real life stories not only clarify the kinds of clients that are referred to you but they identify what you are actually able to do for these clients: </strong></p><p> I wanted to share a true story that reinforces why I love what I do.  I was recently referred a new client, she was a woman in her 60s who recently lost her husband. She came to me emotionally distraught and fearful about her financial affairs.  She didn&rsquo;t know who to turn to nor who she could trust.  After many hours of meeting with her, guiding her and helping her understand her financial picture today she is busy rebuilding her life, with less worry and concern over her daily financial issues. In fact just yesterday she came into the office to share her pictures from her recent vacation, a cruise to Alaska that she has always wanted to experience. </p><p> It&rsquo;s moments like these that remind me why I do what I do.</p><p> <strong>  5.  Ask for feedback:  When providing an interesting article in your email, highlight a paragraph or section of the article that really resonated with you.

{"original_id":2413,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"2 Big Questions Before You Fire That Client","link":"2-big-questions-before-you-fire-that-client","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I encourage you to try this: fire a client.</h3><p> <br/> It is liberating, and it moves your thinking and sense of self worth onto a different professional plane.  Pretty much everyone who has been in professional practice for more than a year has at least one or two clients who are just a wrong fit.  They might be good human beings, and nice with children and small animals, but they are just a wrong fit for the business relationship.</p><h3> You are best to be rid of them.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  There are 2 big questions to work through before you do, but do not underestimate the thought that should go into the decision beforehand if you want to keep your professional reputation intact. </strong></p><p> I remember the first time I did it, and the angst that went into making the decision. It went against everything I&rsquo;d been taught to that point. It was 100% at odds with the &ldquo;customer is king&rdquo; approach to being a professional.  I wrestled with it for weeks before mustering up the courage to actually do it.</p><p> I suspect it was a typical situation shared by many many others really.  It was an investment client, and even though she had said she wanted financial planning advice and I had continually gone through the exercise over a period of a few years to try and get her to consider the future a little more strategically, she insisted on focussing on the transactional.  She did so to the point where she would regularly email me advertisements for investment rates from the newspaper and ask why I hadn&rsquo;t recommended that particular investment.  Any investment recommendation that was made, and occasionally followed, was inevitably challenged within months.  We&rsquo;d started on a fee basis, but then had to change that to a brokerage basis as she felt the fee&rsquo;s were excessive and it was a better deal to pay per investment.</p><h3> Frankly it had reached the point where any contact with her was dreaded.</h3><p> <br/> She didn&rsquo;t take advice, but gave it.   <strong>  She had the attention span of a goldfish. </strong> She wanted to continually chase the latest hot thing.  Newspaper advertisements were more credible than I was.</p><p> Obviously I didn&rsquo;t think I was taking on that sort of client to begin with, but then, every new client is a risk and you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re getting for some time.  But sometimes we have taken on a client and we then find that they are the client from hell. Making more phone calls and sending more emails than the entire Top 20% of your other clients combined.  Fighting fee&rsquo;s and brokerage every step of the way too.  Constantly shifting demands and focus.</p><p> Eventually I came to my senses and fired her.  As it turns out, she was just the first of several more in months to come.  As with so many things in life, after the first one it gets a lot easier&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  The two things I wrestled with were: </strong></p><li> how do I know that it is a good business decision to fire a client (and I am not just reacting illogically)?</li><li> how do I do it professionally, but unequivocally (I don&rsquo;t want to damage my commercial reputation) <br/>  </li><h3> This was how I worked through the decision.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Is it the right thing to do? </strong></p><li> Are we meeting each others behavioural expectations?</li><li> Is there mutual respect?</li><li> Are the expectations of me as an adviser fair and reasonable?</li><li> Is the business relationship economically viable (hours used versus revenue generated)?</li><li> If the answers are &ldquo;no&rdquo;, are any of the above able to remedied?</li><p> <br/> <strong>  What is the right way of doing it? </strong></p><li> Arrange a meeting to discuss it in person</li><li> Adopt the position of &ldquo;I am unable to meet your (client&rsquo;s) expectations&rdquo; in my professional opinion.</li><li> Provide an alternative list of advisers or suppliers specialising in the field or area&rsquo;s they need.</li><li> Offer a full copy of their records/file to transfer to another adviser.</li><li> Provide resignation in writing to client.</li><li> Ensure any or all remuneration arrangements cease (including brokerage; asset fees or anything similar) by advising necessary parties, and ensure those parties are aware you no longer provide advice and/or service.</li><li> Remain civil and professional, including dealing with emails or questions involving transitional arrangements between the client and another firm, but provide no advice or engage in discussion over the decision.</li><p> <br/> Once you have worked through these questions and followed them up with definitive action, there is no question that you have made a good business decision and handled it as professionally as it can be done.  That is about as much as you can hope for when it is time to fire the client from hell.</p><p> Just as an after-thought though, you could adopt the position that a UK adviser took some years ago when regulatory reform was first being introduced.  He (apparently) assessed every one of his 800 or so clients with a simple question: &ldquo;Would this person ever contemplate suing me?&rdquo;</p><p> Apparently he reduced his client base to a total of 6 &ndash; all family members or closest friends of course.   <strong>  But then built a fabulous new business from there&hellip;but that is another story. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-15 17:56:11.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-15 17:56:11.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_WQy94Df.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/2-big-questions-before-you-fire-that-client/\", \"post_id\": \"5441\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-15 17:56:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-15 17:56:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"2-big-questions-before-you-fire-that-client\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5440\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2464\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-15-at-11.00.46-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"411\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439809200,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

One sector that we highlighted as presenting an interesting opportunity was dedicated tax-backed bonds&ndash;specifically dedicated sales tax bonds. Last week, S&amp;P downgraded sales tax bonds issued by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority of Illinois to BBB+ from AAA, which now is comparable to Moody&rsquo;s existing Baa1 rating.</p><h3> So why the massive and abrupt downgrade?</h3><p> <br/> S&amp;P assumed the bonds were protected from Illinois State operating pressures, and monthly revenues would be transferred to the bond trustee even in the absence of legislative appropriation. As a reminder, the State of Illinois has yet to pass a fiscal year 2016 budget because of ongoing debate between the legislature and governor. As a result, the transfer of revenues to the bond trustee cannot be made even though the money is available for debt payments. In fact, the coverage ratio on the bonds is 14x.</p><p> But if the bonds are secured by dedicated sales taxes and have ample debt service coverage, then how can there be appropriation risk? Understanding the security pledge requires a thorough review of the bond documents. The Metro Pier bonds receive sales tax revenue from a special fund at the Illinois Treasury Department. This sales tax revenue doesn&rsquo;t automatically flow into the Metro Pier debt service fund. Instead, it accumulates in the special fund at the state, which then must be appropriated or have legislative action taken in order to be distributed. The security pledge for the Metro Pier bonds is not on the resources of the special IL Treasury fund, but only the appropriated revenues from the fund. So while the revenue is dedicated and the coverage on the bonds is north of 14x, the appropriation cannot take place without a budget or special legislative action.</p><h3> This is called either appropriation or political risk.</h3><p> <br/> While the resources are available to pay debt, there needs to be political will and there needs to be an understanding of the bonds&rsquo; security pledge. The lesson is always check the security provisions for hidden risks in the bond documents.</p>Source: Moody&rsquo;s, S&amp;P<p>  </p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-14 21:23:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-14 21:23:05.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_snbDkcN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/muniland-dedicated-tax-bonds-can-fool-you-always-check-the-official-statement/\", \"post_id\": \"5439\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-14 21:23:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-14 21:23:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"muniland-dedicated-tax-bonds-can-fool-you-always-check-the-official-statement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5438\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2463\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-14-at-2.28.08-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"450\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439816400,"author_id":445,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2410,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Ways Business Owners Fail at Social Media Marketing","link":"5-ways-business-owners-fail-at-social-media-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;ve been slammed these past few weeks working on a side project doing in-depth social media reviews for businesses with a fellow entrepreneur who specializes in helping his creative clients find their ideal customers online.</p><p> It&rsquo;s been eye-opening for me on many levels, and incredibly interesting to see how small businesses are handling their social media.</p><p> In a way, it&rsquo;s been fantastic to see that people NEED ME!</p><p> But it&rsquo;s also been disheartening to see how little is understood about what social media is all about, and how to market effectively on social platforms.</p><p> And before you throw your hands up in the air, I get it &ndash; social media marketing is tough!</p><p> Small business owners don&rsquo;t have the time, resources or attention span to learn social media marketing. But by doing it incorrectly, many are hurting instead of helping their businesses.</p><p> Let me explain, briefly. And check out how to solve these issues below!</p><h3> 1. Philosophy &ndash; Social media is about relationships.</h3><p> <br/> Businesses still believe that social media platforms are solely channels to distribute their promotions. And to be honest, if I didn&rsquo;t know any better, I might do the same. It seems logical.</p><p> But social media is about relationships &ndash; building, investing, and watching them blossom.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve heard business owners discount fans saying they want to have &ldquo;decision-makers&rdquo; and &ldquo;executives&rdquo; in their audience, but they don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s in their audience or who their fans know.</p><p> By treating your social media platforms as promotional platforms, you are alienating everyone from participating in developing a relationship with you.</p><p> They might have originally shown up because your brand/product/service is cool, but you&rsquo;ve got to keep them around &ndash; and that means a relationship must be formed.</p><h3> 2. Replying. (Yes, seriously.)</h3><p> <br/> This is probably my BIGGEST social media pet peeve &ndash; even worse than spamming online communities are the businesses that don&rsquo;t take the time to reply or thank people.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter how big the brand is or how cool the business is &ndash; it&rsquo;s a blessing to have people psyched about what we do, and we should be thankful!</p><p> And big businesses are the worst, yet have the most resources i.e. dolla bills to take the time to do this properly.</p><p> I won&rsquo;t keep going on this subject because it&rsquo;s not productive. Just be nice to your fans, folks!!! ALL of them.</p><h3> 3. Content. Give value.</h3><p> <br/> What is your business doing for its online communities? How are you making their lives, businesses and daily routines better?</p><p> Social media platforms are online communities where fans and followers hang out and communicate in their own language. Twitter does not speak Instagram, and Facebook does not speak Google+.</p><p> They all harbor individual cultures. And that means the content shared must be optimized for each.</p><p> But with this in mind, businesses need to make a real effort to educate, share, and give content that is valuable to their audience and leaves them in a better way.</p><p> The more you give, the more you get. Every time.</p><h3> 4. Personality/human element</h3><p> <br/> Where are YOU in your brand?? If it&rsquo;s a big brand than the YOU isn&rsquo;t as linear, but the human element must exist or people flat out won&rsquo;t become emotionally tied to your brand.</p><p> Maybe you&rsquo;re shy, maybe you are concerned about being too visible online, but you have no idea what an enormous impact getting in front of your brand will do for it.</p><p> People bond with people, not graphics or logos.</p><p> And unless you&rsquo;ve got brand loyalty like Apple, you can&rsquo;t just be a fruit.</p><h3> 5. Consistency.</h3><p> <br/> This is the hardest one, but  <strong>  the most important. </strong></p><p> Being consistent in how you share content, when, and what are critical to your brand. Consistency translates to reliability, credibility and professionalism. And it applies to ALL aspects of social media.</p><p> I always tell my consulting clients &ndash; figure out what you can commit to, and do it. Even if it starts out small i.e. a post once a day, it&rsquo;s consistent, and you can work your way up after a few weeks of getting acclimated.</p><h3> How To Turns Fails Into Wins</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Spend quality time with your audience </strong>  &ndash; finding them, interacting with them and engaging them.</p><p> Nail down your target as definitively as possible, find out where they hang out online, and go introduce yourself. Be polite, ask them ONLY about them, share articles/videos/pictures with them, and build real relationships.</p><p> Ask yourself: How would I start a new relationship with someone I just met?</p><p> Treat your online relationships the same way. Make it about serving them, and watch the bountiful harvest of what it brings.</p><p> <strong>  2. Reply. to. every. person. period. </strong>  And even say thank you to the spammers.

{"original_id":2409,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Women: Look Out For Yourself When It Comes To Money","link":"women-look-out-for-yourself-when-it-comes-to-money","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cathycurtis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Cathy Curtis  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.curtisfinancialplanning.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Curtis Financial Planning  </u> </a>  </p><p> Women have something in common when it comes to their money: At some point in their lives, they will need to manage it on their own. </p><p> Women are marrying later or never marrying, at a higher rate than ever, with marriages down 60 percent from 1970.* The divorce rate in the U.S. remains high, at 40 to 50 percent, and women still outlive men by about five years. Still, many women are unprepared to be effective stewards of their financial lives. </p><p> As an advisor focused on women clients, I often hear statements such as:</p><p> &ldquo;My dad invested my money for me, and I haven&rsquo;t looked at my accounts since he died.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;My brother is managing my money, and I&rsquo;m not sure how it&rsquo;s invested.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;I handled the bills, and my husband took care of everything else.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m embarrassed about my finances and how clueless I feel about my money.&rdquo;</p><p> By seeking out an advisor, these women acknowledged they needed help, but there are many who don&rsquo;t seek help and miss out on opportunities to save and invest wisely&mdash;possibly undermining their financial health.</p><p> Because of these realities, I believe it is crucial that women make financial decisions as if they were the sole keeper of their personal finances in all phases of their lives. Learn from these women and their stories: </p><p> <strong>  Single, Urban and Underpaid </strong></p><p> Mary is a single woman living in an expensive urban area. She is 35 years old and has a job that she loves.However, her pay covers her living expenses&mdash;and that&rsquo;s about it. She isn&rsquo;t saving for retirement and has $15,000 in a savings account, earning next to nothing. She feels she is underpaid, but she is very loyal to her employer and is always willing to take on extra work for no extra pay. </p><p> <strong>  Advice: </strong>   As the sole steward of her finances, Mary owes it to herself to ask for a raise &ndash; at least enough so that she can contribute to an individual retirement account. Or, she could ask her employer if they would contribute to a retirement savings account for her. </p><p> If she can&rsquo;t get an increase in pay or benefits from her employer, then her only options are to find a higher-paying job or to reduce her living expenses. Then she can afford to save for retirement and other financial goals.</p><p> <strong>  Middle-aged and Widowed </strong></p><p> Sally is 57 years old, the mother of a teenage daughter and a recent and unexpected widow. She gave up her career to raise her daughter and now works part-time for very little money.</p><p> For the first time, she is forced to handle the finances: understanding her investments and figuring out whether there is enough money to last through retirement. As she becomes more educated, she realizes that her husband left some money on the table. For example, he wasn&rsquo;t contributing the maximum to his 401(k) plan or contributing enough to get the full employer match. In addition, he invested his 401(k) savings in stable value funds as he was extremely risk-averse. Given the number of years he worked, the 401(k) balance is disappointing.</p><p> Fortunately, he worked for a large corporation, and there were other retirement income benefits. Sally and her husband were frugal, and she thinks she will be able to get by, but she is actively looking for full-time work.</p><p> <strong>  Lesson: </strong>   Women who disrupt their careers to raise children also disrupt their ability to save for retirement. However, there are several things that wives can do even if they aren&rsquo;t earning money:</p><p> &ndash; Get educated about basic investments, and understand the investments in spousal retirement and joint accounts. <br/> &ndash; Make sure their spouse is fully maximizing employee benefits, (especially employer match to a retirement plan), life insurance, and disability benefits. <br/> &ndash; Learn about and take advantage of the spousal IRA. <br/> &ndash; Have jointly owned, as well as individual, bank and credit card accounts. <br/> &ndash; Know where all the money is, and keep log-in credentials for all accounts stored safely. <br/> &ndash; Open a Roth IRA and contribute any earned income from part-time work.</p><p> <strong>  Successful and Divorcing </strong> <br/> <br/> Jane has a lucrative corporate career in technology. She is 45 and has made six figures since her late 30s and receives generous company benefits. She has a large balance in her 401(k) plan and substantial investments outside of her 401(k). </p><p> Her husband, who is a writer and stay-at-home dad (they have a 7-year-old son) announced unexpectedly that he wanted a divorce. Jane, focused on her work, did not expect this and realized too late that she did not prepare for this possibility. She has hired a lawyer to help with a property settlement.</p><p> <strong>  Lesson: </strong>  If a woman is coming into a marriage with wealth, it pays to consider executing a prenuptial agreement beforehand. Prenups are not a romantic proposition, and it might seem like they&rsquo;re meant only for the super-rich, but that isn&rsquo;t the case.</p><p> At a highly emotional time, she will be required to make decisions that will affect the rest of her life, as well as that of her child. A prenuptial agreement would have made this process a lot less stressful and ensure a fairer outcome.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-13 18:56:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-13 18:56:30.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_SmclIoL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/women-look-out-for-yourself-when-it-comes-to-money/\", \"post_id\": \"5433\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-13 18:56:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-13 18:56:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"women-look-out-for-yourself-when-it-comes-to-money\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5432\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2460\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Life-of-Pix-free-stock-photos-girl-blond-hair-bar-leeroy-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"696\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439579700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

The best of intentions have turned into sloppy messes.  They are heaps of confusing, conflicting activities&hellip;poorly designed and impossible to execute.</p><p> Why?</p><p> It usually starts with too many clients.  And continues with mazes of perplexing clients segments.  In the end, there aren&rsquo;t enough hours in the day to keep up.</p><p> The freedom that should come with a healthy, growing business turns into ulcers.  You wonder&hellip;</p><li> when you spoke with a client last</li><li> where you&rsquo;ll find time to return calls</li><li> how you&rsquo;ll keep up with the recurring contact sequences you put in place</li><li> why you got yourself into this mess <br/>  </li><p> The freedom to work with clients you enjoy doesn&rsquo;t feel free if you can&rsquo;t make sense of it.  If it becomes unrecognizable because you&rsquo;ve layered patches on top of fixes.  If it turns client service into a chore.</p><p> In a client-focused practice, the client part should be FUN.</p><p> What&rsquo;s needed?  Two things:  fewer clients and a repeatable service model.</p><p> Yes, that&rsquo;s what I wrote&hellip;fewer clients.  More is not better.  The 80\\20 rule, deny it at your own peril, tells the story.</p><p> Think of this as getting down to your core.</p><p> In recent years, I&rsquo;ve worked with hundreds of advisors on this very issue.  From out of control teams with hundreds of tangled clients to highly specialized practices with clear focuses, the question remains constant:  <strong>  Can you do more with less? </strong></p><p> The answer is always a resounding yes.</p><li> Revenues double and triple as advisors shed hundreds of clients from their books.</li><li> High quality referrals stream in as advisors raise the bar to entry into their practices.</li><li> Sanity is restored when teams really get to know their most important clients. <br/>  </li><p> These are all signs of freedom&hellip;financial freedom, freedom of client selection, freedom of time and freedom from stress.</p><p> This freedom can be compounded when you add a REPEATABLE service model.</p><p> A while back, I was talking with an advisor about his client contact routine.  He already bought into the &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; mind set.  Yet while producing well over 7 figures of annually recurring fees with fewer than 75 clients, he admitted to &ldquo;losing touch&rdquo;.</p><p> And now, some of his clients were grumbling loudly.</p><p> For the first time in years, he had just fought off an account transfer.  This top 25 client was looking for greener pastures.  A decades old relationship was willing to try out a veritable rookie at another firm.</p><p> The client felt ignored.  He no longer knew what to expect from the advisor.</p><p> The fact that this client&rsquo;s portfolio was outpacing the S&amp;P 500 didn&rsquo;t matter.  All the time the advisor had put into this client&rsquo;s financial plan didn&rsquo;t matter.  The advisor&rsquo;s 60, 70 and 80 hour workweeks didn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p> Deep down, the advisor felt sure this revolt wasn&rsquo;t isolated to just one client.</p><p> What was missing?</p><p> A disciplined client care ritual.  The time gained from managing fewer relationships had spun out of control.  The goal of more time for fewer clients had been dashed.  He was actually spending MORE time in the office each week.</p><p> What could be more important than spending time with clients?</p><p> So we implemented a monthly contact routine.  The idea was to dedicate a specific hour each month to each client.  With 75 clients, that&rsquo;s been less than four hours per day.  More importantly, it&rsquo;s a repeatable approach to client care.</p><p> His clients love it.  Now, they know what to expect each and every month.</p><p> In subsequent months, the advisor spent less time in the office.  He had a huge increase in referrals from his clients.  His year over year production grew measurably.</p><p> By applying the discipline of a repeatable client contact to a limited number of clients, he has improved the quality of his freedom.</p><p> I have seen this scenario play out over and over again.  The results are dramatic and sustainable.</p><p> Discipline applied to client care means greater freedom.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-13 18:43:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-13 18:43:49.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_8OGp9Ku.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-freedom-of-focused-client-care/\", \"post_id\": \"5431\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-13 18:43:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-13 18:43:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-freedom-of-focused-client-care\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5430\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2459\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Life-of-Pix-free-stock-photos-men-train-station-white-leeroy-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"572\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439643600,"author_id":403,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2407,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Financial Tips for Surviving a Job Loss","link":"6-financial-tips-for-surviving-a-job-loss","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Nobody takes pleasure in suddenly becoming unemployed. </strong> Just the &lsquo;prospect&rsquo; alone can be very overwhelming and stressful. Often the worry or anxiety comes from feeling you have no control over the situation. This is partially true; you may not be able to control what your employer does but you can control to some extent how it will affect you and your family. The reality is, no one&rsquo;s job is really secure but a layoff doesn&rsquo;t have to be the end of the world. The key to survival is to be prepared, especially regarding money matters. Here are some financial tips for surviving a job loss:</p><h3> Financial Tips for Surviving a Job Loss</h3><p> <strong>  1. Have emergency funds put aside </strong> to cover at least three-six months of your basic living expenses, such as your rent or mortgage, utilities, food and debt repayment.</p><p> <strong>  2. Set up a line of credit while you&rsquo;re still employed. </strong> I am always cautious giving this advice, especially to people who have trouble staying out of debt. While you have an income, go to your bank and see if you qualify for more credit. If you lose your job and have no replacement income or not enough to cover the monthly costs of running your household, you will be in real trouble. This is when people get desperate and max out their 18% (or more) credit cards or potentially file bankruptcy. So get a line of credit now just in case you&rsquo;ll need one later.</p><p> <strong>  3. Get out of as much debt as possible. </strong> Transfer high debt loans/credit cards to lower interest rate vehicles and then start aggressively paying them down. By reducing or eliminating your debt, you reduce the amount of money that leaves your pocket each month. If you lose your job, you want to be able to survive on as little amount of money for as long as possible.</p><p> <strong>  4. Develop a &lsquo;layoff&rsquo; budget before you lose your job. </strong> Figure out what sources of income you will have coming in such as EI and/or a severance package. Assess your basic living costs &ndash; mortgage/rent, utilities, loans, and food. Ensure you have an emergency reserve and/or line of credit established that would cover any shortfall in income over a six-month period.</p><p> <strong>  5. Start living within your means now. </strong> This is generally a good idea, regardless of whether or not a layoff is looming, but if a potential job loss is on the near horizon, avoid any unnecessary purchases for the time being, such as a new car, vacation, or renovating your home. Live as frugally as you can now and bank any extra monies. We have heard it all before, leave the credit cards at home and pay cash for all purchases. Try to grocery shop only once a week. Eat out less. Re-evaluate all of your monthly bills and find ways to reduce them; call your phone provider and see if a better, less costly plan exists, let go of some of the cable channels. Get the whole family involved in the process. It will definitely teach your kids some smart money practices.</p><p> <strong>  6. Find ways to bring in some extra money now and then bank it.  </strong> You could have a garage sale, sell items you don&rsquo;t need anymore on eBay or assess your skills and see if there&rsquo;s something you can do on the side for extra income or get a part time job now. Necessity is a time for creativity.

{"original_id":2406,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Identify and Find Your Ideal Client","link":"how-to-identify-and-find-your-ideal-client","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In any consultative sales environment we are challenged to prospect mindfully while gaining as many new clients as possible. It is therefore important to identify and develop an ideal client profile. While we could fish in the ocean and maybe find a precious oyster once in a while, it's time consuming and exhausting.</p><p> Knowing who you want to prospect is essential to growing your business. Wouldn't it make more sense to call on prospects who respond to your messaging rather than e-mailing, calling or talking to people who will not end up buying your service?</p><p> It sounds logical, right? Very often though, we sales people spend much too much time on developing and nurturing leads with prospects who might show some interest, but end up never buying from us. And there is a reason for that. Many sales leaders encourage activity. While activity is important, it's not only how many outreaches you do every day, but being sure that the people that you call on fit your ideal client profile.</p><p> <strong>  Who will buy my service? </strong></p><p> The ideal client is a prospect who is not only interested in your service, but also has a need. As soon as your offering is relevant to their job responsibilities, you will be able to have a good conversation, you will be able to add VALUE and if the time is right you will be able to close the business. Below is a checklist that sales people should go through before crafting their messages.</p><li> Identifying the industries that will benefit most from your product/service (each industry might have different challenges)</li><li> Finding the right decision maker (who will benefit most from your offering)</li><li> Timing</li><p> Some  <strong>  industries </strong>  will be more responsive to your offering than others. The best way to find that out is to see where your company had the best traction in the past and/or to find reasons why one specific industry might be a better fit and test it out. For example, our eLearning sales training solution sits best with companies that have sales people in one than more location (often with an international presence), so industries such as technology and transportation find real value in what we are offering, because their sales force is not in one place.</p><p> Finding the right  <strong>  decision maker </strong>  is key in crafting your outreach. You don't want to talk money to an HR person, they are often not responsible for the budget. It's important though when talking to finance people. In any event, think about the value that it will bring to them, don't talk about features and benefits.</p><p> <strong>  Timing </strong>  is also crucial. Ask about current engagements, when they are up for renewal and budget cycles. This way you can mindfully stay in touch and be sure that you are part of the decision once your prospect starts looking for new providers.</p><p> <strong>   Why will somebody buy my service? </strong></p><p> There are drivers that will cause a person to be inclined to buy. Here are the motivators, it helps them to</p><li> Make money</li><li> Save money</li><li> Avoid stress or hassle and/or it elevates their reputation</li><p> If you cannot touch on any of those triggers, you don't have a product or service that resonates. Sometimes sales is a numbers game, but only in the sense that more targeted activity leads to more qualified prospects. The more you are able to narrow down your prospect list with companies that will find value in what you are offering, identifying the right decision maker within those organizations and being aware of the timing, the better equipped you are to spend the time you have available for prospecting in the most effective way possible.</p><p> Knowing where to hunt is the first step to accelerate your sales process. It will help you save time and money and it will reduce rejection, because your audiences will be perceptive to your messages.</p><p> Once you have identified your idea client profile you will be able to selling rather than sifting through a jungle.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-13 18:39:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-13 18:39:09.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_T2xDXUk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-identify-and-find-your-ideal-client/\", \"post_id\": \"5427\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-13 18:39:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-13 18:39:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-identify-and-find-your-ideal-client\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5426\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2457\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Life-of-Pix-free-stock-photos-corridor-columns-stones-nabeelsyed-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"405\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439591400,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2404,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Avoid the Delegation Trap","link":"how-to-avoid-the-delegation-trap","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Some of the most powerful speeches of the last century were delivered against the backdrop of war, or the prospect of it. Lincoln at Gettysburg, Roosevelt&rsquo;s Pearl Harbor Address and Churchill&rsquo;s &lsquo;We Shall Fight on the Beaches&rdquo; to name a few. The prospect of victory, or defeat, was very real for the audience, and the speaker. When a senior leader has the power to communicate a compelling story, people can be moved &hellip; to think, to act, to follow, to change. But good storytelling alone is not enough.</p><p> &ldquo;Churchill wrote his own speeches. When a leader does that, he becomes emotionally invested with his utterances. If Churchill had had a speech writer in 1940, Britain would be speaking German today.&rdquo; &ndash; James C. Humes, American presidential speechwriter</p><p> In times of great change, authenticity of message and ownership of change will make the difference between victory and defeat. Whether that change is a prime minister&rsquo;s resolve to lead the country into war, or a CEO&rsquo;s decision to introduce a bold new strategy, or announce necessary layoffs.</p><p> Each organization&rsquo;s most senior leader is ultimately accountable for everything that happens in their business. But they are not always responsible, nor should they be. There are many important activities that leaders can, and should, delegate to capable people on their teams. Change is not one of them. The leader must visibly own the change, and feel ultimately accountable for its success in order for change to occur.</p><p> In today&rsquo;s complex corporate structures, the temptation to delegate change is understandable. There are whole teams dedicated to project management,  human resource leaders skilled in organizational design and consultancies specializing in cultural transformation. And yes, the best leaders leverage these skills and capabilities as they lead their organizations through change to the future. But they do not delegate the most important elements.</p><p> CEOs should be  primarily  accountable for two important business drivers that are essential elements in change: their organization&rsquo;s purpose and values.  The trap in delegating change leadership is the emotional distance it creates between the leader and these two key drivers of transformation. For change leadership, each step away from the most senior leader on the organizational chart means less focus and urgency when it is needed most.</p><p> Leaders should see change as their charge precisely because it both impacts purpose and values and is driven by them. Leaders should spend time building the case for change, pausing regularly in the construction of it to ask: why, in the context of our purpose, is this change necessary? Which of our values and beliefs will enable this change? What in our purpose and values must be protected during this change and how can we best accomplish that? The leader must genuinely ask and answer these questions for themselves and their organization before sharing her message with her team.</p><p> When change becomes a corporate initiative, it is doomed. When a leader truly believes in the case for change, and is personally invested in it, real transformation can occur.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-13 18:29:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-13 18:29:55.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_31Lpsve.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-avoid-the-delegation-trap/\", \"post_id\": \"5423\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-13 18:29:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-13 18:29:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-avoid-the-delegation-trap\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5422\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2455\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Life-of-Pix-free-stock-photos-landscape-water-snow-jordansanchez-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"496\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439575200,"author_id":53,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2403,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Steps To Banish Anxiety","link":"6-steps-to-banish-anxiety","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeuroKarmapro\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mark Rogers, PhD  </u> </a></p><h3> Was there ever a monster in your room when you were a child?</h3><p> <br/> My room seemed to be infested with them.I&rsquo;d wake in the night to see some sinister figure standing menacingly in the shadows and I&rsquo;d call out for help.When my dad came and put on the light, the monster always turned out to be just a coat hanging over a chair, or some other trick of shadow and light.</p><p> Phew!</p><p> My room doesn&rsquo;t have so many monsters these days, but whether we left childhood behind six months ago or six decades ago, our brain still works in pretty much the same way as when shadows kept us awake at night. We still experience fears. But as adults we act as our own parent to calm those fears.</p><p> Aggh! It&rsquo;s coming for me!</p><h3> The almond where fears are born</h3><p> <br/> The part of the brain that gives us that initial jolt of fear is the &lsquo;amygdala&rsquo; (from the Latin word for almond). It&rsquo;s like a smoke alarm, but it&rsquo;s sensitive to all sorts of potential dangers. When we hear or see something that might signal danger, the amygdala bursts into action and sends signals to the rest of the brain (and the body )to get ready to fight, or to run away. That&rsquo;s why you feel a sudden shock as your heart begins to pound and the release of adrenalin acts to make your mind alert and increases the fuel supply to your muscles.</p><h3> And all this starts before you are even consciously aware of what you heard or saw</h3><p> <br/> The amygdala is incredibly useful because it gets visual and sound information before we have had time to fully process it. That means it can react very quickly to potential threats, it doesn&rsquo;t wait until we&rsquo;ve thought about the situation. Soldiers in the First World War reported that they sometimes threw themselves to the ground without even thinking about it and moments later a shell would explode nearby. They had no conscious sensation of danger, yet that unconscious impulse saved many lives. That warning came from the amygdala. But the drawback is that the amygdala is not very smart. The information it gets is raw and &lsquo;fuzzy&rsquo; so it will often cause false alarms. So this is a trade-off; we get great speed but we pay a price in accuracy. Normally that&rsquo;s OK since it&rsquo;s better to be prepared for a real threat and put up with some false alarms than to have no false alarms but miss a warning of a real danger. Just like it&rsquo;s better to have a smoke alarm that sometimes goes off just because the toaster was set to high, than to not have one at all.</p><h3> But what if you can&rsquo;t turn that smoke alarm off?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s OK if your smoke alarm sometimes goes off unnecessarily, but it isn&rsquo;t OK if it won&rsquo;t stop! A smoke alarm that won&rsquo;t go off would soon drive you up the wall. And an amygdala that won&rsquo;t stop signaling danger is just as bad. Most of the time the amygdala is &lsquo;turned off&rsquo; by the frontal, &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; parts of the brain. Once we know that the danger has passed are that there was a false alarm, these brain regions send signals to the amygdala to calm it down and stop the danger response that the amygdala initiated. But sometimes that feedback mechanism doesn&rsquo;t work very well. In severe cases this can be associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or social phobia. But even in less severe cases it can lead to chronic stress because of the feeling that we are continually under threat</p><p> Sometimes the amygdala is too sensitive</p><p> Imagine if your smoke alarm went off when there wasn&rsquo;t even any smoke. Say it went off just because you opened a cupboard where the matches are kept, or it went off in response to steam from the kettle. That smoke alarm would really be a headache. And the amygdala can become like that smoke alarm, especially if we have leaned to feel anxious in particular situations. When I first stated lecturing at university I was thrown, with no training or guidance, into lecture halls with 500 students in front of me, and left to sink or swim. Was I nervous?</p><p> Oh you bet I was!</p><p> Now, one of the things that the amygdala is very sensitive to is facial expression. A hostile, angry face looking at you will trigger an alert signal from your amygdala. And that&rsquo;s great. But when you are as nervous as I was in front of those 500 students, your amygdala becomes like the smoke alarm that responds to steam. Almost any face begins to seem hostile. A bored face, a neutral face, even a smiling face can seem hostile. And that constant signal of danger from the amygdala makes it all but impossible to calm down enough for the intelligent parts of your brain to turn the amygdala off. It might be annoying sometimes, but it could save your life.</p><h3> To switch off the alarm we need to change our viewpoint</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s great that the amygdala becomes more sensitive when we are in a dangerous environment. When danger is all around, great sensitivity to anything that might be a threat is a huge advantage. But it&rsquo;s a huge disadvantage if we treat a normal environment as if it were dangerous; like I did as a nervous lecturer just starting out. What we need is some way of changing our view of the situation, some way of convincing the amygdala that this is just a normal situation, and not a dangerous environment.</p><h3> Cognitive Restructuring</h3><p> <br/> Cognitive restructuring is a simple process you can use to help reduce your sensitivity to something that makes you anxious. All it really means is that we change our thinking about something. And that change of thinking leads to a change in how we feel about it. Research has shown that cognitive restructuring can act to reduce activity in the amygdala and increase activity in the intelligent parts of the brain that switch the amygdala&rsquo;s alert signal off. In other words, it stops the amygdala from being over sensitive and causing fear when there is really no need for it.</p><p> Just like my Dad turning on the light!</p><h3>  So how do you do it?</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Get as relaxed as you can</h3><p> You need to be in a relaxed state before you start. One of the best (and quickest!) ways of doing this is 4-7-8 breathing. You can see how to do that in  <u>  this </u>  post. But, if you have a particular meditative practice or other means of getting yourself into a nice relaxed stare, then do make use of that.</p><h3> 2. Visualize the event that causes anxiety.</h3><p> Now there&rsquo;s no need to wallow in your anxious experience here- but you do need to spend enough time thinking about it to allow you to do the next step. If you begin to feel too anxious then just stop. Try the 4-7-8 breathing and start again when you are calmer.</p><h3> 3. Pay attention to your thoughts</h3><p> When you visualize the anxious situation you will almost certainly start having certain thoughts. These are thoughts that occur automatically whenever you face the situation, or even just think about it. For this reason they are called automatic thoughts. These thoughts are a huge clue to what is really troubling you and becoming aware of these thoughts is one of the important aims of  cognitive restructuring. You see, when you start having those feelings of anxiety, they are accompanied by anxious thoughts, but the thoughts are often hidden from us. That&rsquo;s why I say cognitive restructuring is like turning on a light, allowing us to see what is really there. This is so important because thoughts are something over which we can readily gain control. But feelings are more difficult. And although we can change our mood once we know how, without changing the thoughts that give rise to negative feelings, they are likely to recur. So in this step we want to really concentrate on capturing the thoughts that come to mind when we envisage this situation. And the thoughts we really want to get a handle on are those that are accompanied by anxious feelings. So notice those thoughts and write them down. The next thing we need to do is a realistic and objective evaluation of those thoughts. Time to look at the FACTS</p><h3> 4. Is there anything to suggest your automatic thoughts might be TRUE?</h3><p> This is where we start to test these thoughts, to weigh them in our hand and see whether there really is anything to be anxious about. First, think about, and write down, any evidence that supports the thoughts you identified. When I was a nervous lecturer, I thought that nobody liked my lectures and that everyone was bored. I could certainly find evidence to support that. Looking around there were bored looking students and even resentful looking students. So, if I was doing cognitive restructuring, I would write that evidence down next to the relevant thoughts.</p><h3> 5. Is there anything to suggest your automatic thoughts might be FALSE?</h3><p> When we have those automatic thoughts we tend to believe them unquestionably. That&rsquo;s why they can have so much power over us. But chances are that the evidence isn&rsquo;t all one way. In this step you think of evidence that doesn&rsquo;t fit in with the thoughts you identified in step 3. This is excellent at weakening the hold these automatic thoughts have over us. It might take a bit of effort to find facts that argue against your automatic thoughts.But don&rsquo;t give up! Keep at it and you will find something to balance up the ledger. So, thinking back to my anxious, early lectures; there were students who came to see me after the lecture to discuss things they found interesting. That&rsquo;s pretty good evidence that not everyone found my lectures boring. And isn&rsquo;t it true that some students find pretty much any lecture boring? So it isn&rsquo;t necessarily ME that&rsquo;s the problem. Obviously the more positive evidence you can find the better. But don&rsquo;t worry if you can only think of one or two things. Remember, all you need is just a bit of evidence that stands against those automatic thoughts. Again, write this information next to the relevant automatic thoughts.</p><h3> 6. Think about the situation again, putting all the information from steps 4 &amp; 5 together to give a more balanced view.</h3><p> Now you have a more realistic picture of the true situation. There may well be some truth to some of the anxious thoughts you&rsquo;ve been having. But you now know that there is more to the story. There is also a brighter side. There are things about the situation that aren&rsquo;t so daunting. There have been times when it&rsquo;s worked out well for you. Or perhaps you&rsquo;ve learned a lot since you last tried, or maybe there is a new ally on your side. In my case, I would try to keep in mind that while some students do look bored in my lectures, I know for a fact that at least some of them find it interesting and helpful.</p><h3> Conclusions</h3><p> <br/> By getting a hold of our automatic thoughts and bringing them into the light we can judge them objectively and work out whether or not we really have anything to be concerned about. Notice I said concerned about and not anxious about. The purpose of cognitive restructuring isn&rsquo;t just to make ourselves feel better, it&rsquo;s also to help ourselves to do better. After going through the process, I can see that my anxiety about boring all my students was misplaced. But I can also see that maybe I needed to do something to improve how I taught. After all, engaged students learn better than bored students. Feeling less anxious means you are much more able to act effectively. And that, in turn, further banishes the anxiety. It&rsquo;s a virtuous cycle, and it all starts with taking a close look at the thoughts that lie under your feelings.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-13 18:24:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-13 18:24:55.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_ROh1Osp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-steps-to-banish-anxiety/\", \"post_id\": \"5421\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-13 18:24:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-13 18:24:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-steps-to-banish-anxiety\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5420\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2454\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/anxiety1.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"576\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439568000,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

In fact, the definition of a &ldquo;profession&rdquo; adopted by Professions Australia opens with: &ldquo;A profession is a disciplined group of individuals who adhere to ethical standards&hellip;&rdquo;</p><h3> But what do we mean by &ldquo;ethics&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> There are many different definitions, perceptions and opinions about ethics, but I prefer the original concept. The father of philosophy, Socrates, believed that it was summed up in a short question: &ldquo;What ought one to do?&rdquo;</p><p> Ethics, therefore, is simply how to decide what to do in any given situation. The significance of this definition should not be underestimated. It poses two fundamental challenges that many people struggle with:</p><p> <strong>  1. Ethics requires a thinking process </strong> , a basis or a framework for an individual to make decisions &ndash; and not everyone is willing to attempt to understand how they make decisions.</p><p> <strong>  2. Ethics is about action. </strong> It&rsquo;s not the theory or the intentions that count, it is what is actually done that matters &ndash; and not everyone is willing to be judged on their actions.</p><p> So this is a very difficult subject, and how it is made visible in your business is a real challenge. If you decide to lift the profile of ethical thinking in your business, two options are readily promoted:</p><h3> Undertake an ethics course</h3><p> <br/> This will be helpful if you and your team would like a better understanding of the many different ethical frameworks that might be adopted (and there are plenty of them). This could be especially useful if you and your team have different backgrounds and it appears that people make decisions differently. However, on its own it won&rsquo;t be sufficient, because ethics is about action.</p><h3> Develop your own code of ethics</h3><p> <br/> This will be helpful if you would like to differentiate the ethics of your business from the ethics of your competitors (or your clients&rsquo; expectations). This could be especially useful as a team activity to collectively define your code. Again, however, it won&rsquo;t be sufficient, because ethics is about action.</p><p> My strong recommendation is to establish a habit of sharing actual ethical problems that arise and working through the options to make (and implement) a transparent decision. Whether the process happens formally via an &lsquo;ethics committee&rsquo; or informally through ad hoc discussions at a desk, water cooler or team meeting is not important.</p><p> What is important is that we exercise our ethical thinking capability. I recently attended a workshop, led by Simon Longstaff of the St James Ethics Centre, and his strong contention is that employees are not given enough opportunity to practise ethical thinking. Too often the decisions are delegated to the compliance team or sent for a legal opinion.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s consider a simple example and how the process might work. Imagine that you have inadvertently shared one client&rsquo;s financial information with another client. What ought one to do? Longstaff&rsquo;s concern is that many business people would refrain from thinking about this and seek a legal opinion based on the Privacy Act.</p><p> My recommendation would be to include a few members of your team in a discussion about the possible actions that could be taken. The discussion should include the rationale for the actions and, importantly, the basis for making (and implementing) the final decision.</p><p> This is not only educational and informative for your team, but they build confidence that they are working in an ethical business.</p><p> These are the best of times to ensure that your business is run on ethical principles &ndash; and that ethical decision-making is shared and visible.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-13 18:14:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-13 18:14:33.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_Mh3JfSx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-creating-a-truly-ethical-business-is-about-actions-not-words/\", \"post_id\": \"5419\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-13 18:14:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-13 18:14:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-creating-a-truly-ethical-business-is-about-actions-not-words\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5418\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2453\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-13-at-11.20.11-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"512\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439549100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

At first it can seem like an infinite room of strangers all tweeting about random stuff, punctuated by in-jokes and littered with poor vocabulary. Not to mention all those weird and wonderful conventions and rituals such as hashtags, DMs, @mentions, FFs and many more, which can seem impenetrable to the Twitter novice. Isn't this meant to be a mass market social network, not some form of online Freemasonry?</p><p> But please, please don't be put off. In some areas of life, first impressions can be pretty reliable but, trust me, Twitter is not one of them. If you're prepared to push past the initial sense of overwhelming confusion (remember, we've ALL been there!) and virtual funny handshakes, you'll be amazed how quickly everything starts to click. In no time at all, you'll appreciate just why Twitter has become one of the most indispensable marketing tools there is, with the ability to reach global audiences instantly and create meaningful relationships and connections. And it's not just consumer brands that can benefit from this: Twitter should be an essential part of any B2B company's marketing mix, too.</p><p> According to research conducted by Twitter and Market Probe International, 85% of respondents felt more connected with a business after following them on Twitter; and 72% of were more likely to buy from a business they followed.</p><p> Time and again I have watched B2B businesses go through the various stages of Twitter adoption: from initial scepticism, through reluctant toe in the water, to the moment when the penny really drops...\"how did we ever think Twitter wasn't right for us!\"</p><p> Some companies successfully manage to make this Twitter journey by themselves. Others prefer to get outside help from a specialist, who should be able to help make the transition through the various stages as swift and painless as possible.</p><p> However you decide go about it, the main thing is that you see the journey through. I promise it will be worth it.</p><p> In future posts I'll be expanding on how to go about breaking through the Twitter pain barrier, and also offering up some tips on how you should be spending your time when you come out the other side. In the meantime, this article is a good place to find out more about those weird and wonderful Twitter rituals (though sadly not a single mention of funny handshakes to be found!):  <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2014/08/21/twitter-jargon-illustrated-rt-mt-canoes-darth?utm_content=bufferf11e1&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  '  <u>   Twitter Demystified: How To RT, MT, #FF And Fave Like A Pro.

{"original_id":2399,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Ingredients To Trustworthy Leadership","link":"five-ingredients-to-trustworthy-leadership","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I happen to love baking apple pies. Through the years I have experimented with many different piecrust recipes, some containing butter and some containing shortening. Not all recipes lead to tasty piecrusts so I have learned to trust my past baking strategies and only incorporate a new ingredient if it aligns with my past successes.</p><p> Learning to be a trustworthy leader is similar to baking an apple pie. We need to take a hard look at what goes into being trustworthy and identify the core elements that make it work. We also need to look at the trustworthy leaders we have worked with and how they were able to gain our trust.</p><p> <strong>  Five Ingredients to Becoming TrustWorthy: </strong></p><h3> 1. Follow Through Like A Football Pass</h3><p> <br/> Similar to an athlete being counted on to complete a strategic play, leaders too need to be reliable and  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2014/09/08/is-being-an-accountable-leader-just-common-sense/#sthash.05rLIyGB.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   accountable  </u>  . </a>  If we make a commitment to our team members or people we are collaborating with, then we need to make it happen. If we want to be offered higher level assignments and projects, we must prove we will come through. The interesting part of being known as dependable is that we are actually building relationships and our reputation.</p><h3> 2. Highlight The Mistakes</h3><p> <br/> We all mess up from time to time but what differentiates those of us who have built up credit with others is that we are willing to say we made a mistake.</p><li> Tell others that an error was made early on</li><li> Find a solution to rectify the mistake either by researching a new approach or by asking team members for their ideas</li><li> Share lessons learned so others can avoid the same misstep</li><li> Encourage the people we work with to be open about their  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/blog/#sthash.XzBULioS.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   mistakes  </a> </u>  by being understanding <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Talk Straight</h3><p> <br/> The way we communicate with people is key to how they relate to us. When we are honest with our feedback, respectful of their perspectives and speak with clear language, we will be more trustworthy. I had a manager in one of my leadership workshops who felt he should withhold information that people on his team didn&rsquo;t need to have. After asking him why, he realized that by not sharing all the facts, it was impossible for transparency and real creative problem solving.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Leaders+share+all+the+facts+to+create+transparency+and+trust.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/08/10/five-ingredients-to-trustworthy-leadership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Leaders share all the facts to create transparency and trust  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 4. Listen For The Train Horn</h3><p> <br/> According to Stephen M.R. Covey in his notable book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/SPEED-Trust-Thing-Changes-Everything-ebook/dp/B000MGATWG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438870543&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+speed+of+trust+by+covey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;The Speed Of Trust&rdquo;  </a> </u> , when we take time to really listen to someone first and get all the information, we not only build up trust with others, but the issues get resolved in a quicker and mutually respectful way. Covey poses these questions about listening to establish trust:</p><li> Have I really listened to the other person?</li><li> Do I really understand how he or she feels?</li><li> Think back to a time when you didn&rsquo;t listen first. What were the results? What would have been the results if I had listened differently? <br/>  </li><h3> 5. Give Credit And Recognition</h3><p> <br/> Have you ever worked with someone who took all the credit for a joint project? I was coaching a manager who felt so betrayed when she was not recognized for her contributions. She felt she was not a valued team member and lost trust with her boss. I also had a manager in one of my workshops who felt just the opposite-  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/?s=give+credit#sthash.C4llQAOF.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   acknowledged for his outstanding work  </u>  . </a>  He was so appreciative to be given credit for his hard efforts and results and looked forward to future assignments. That is building trust.</p><p> <strong>  What does a trustworthy leader look like to you?

{"original_id":2398,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Social Media Wills: What You Need to Know","link":"social-media-wills-what-you-need-to-know","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Do you use social media every day without a second thought? Is Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram the first thing you check when you wake up? If so, have you ever thought about how you want your online presence managed in the event you pass away?</p><p> Most of us haven&rsquo;t thought about what would happen to the life we&rsquo;ve created online once we&rsquo;re gone. But we spend so much of our time on social media that we need to think about this (no matter how morbid it seems). And that brings us to the importance of creating a social media will.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at exactly what a social media will is, what it does for you, if it&rsquo;s truly necessary, and how you can go about drafting one.</p><h3> Managing Your Social Media Presence After You Pass Away</h3><p> <br/> The purpose of having a social media will is to manage your social media presence after you pass away in accordance with your wishes.</p><p> Even though we might not be there to post updates, our accounts will still be active. People can still interact with &ldquo;us.&rdquo; They can view our past photos, tag us in theirs, or mention us in passing.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve experienced a friend or family member passing away, you might have seen this play out. This is especially true for Facebook, where surviving friends can memorialize a person&rsquo;s page. Others can post stories and pictures, virtually gathering together in honor of someone&rsquo;s memory.</p><p> Deciding what to do with your social media accounts after your death is an extremely important part of  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/5-signs-you-may-need-a-financial-planner/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your overall estate plan  </a> </u> . If you don&rsquo;t have a social media will in place, then it might be difficult for your family or friends to gain access to your accounts to handle them as you wish.</p><h3> When Is a Social Media Will Needed?</h3><p> <br/> Generally, social media wills are for those who rely heavily on social media for personal or business use or want to ensure any accounts in their names are handled in a certain way after they pass.</p><p> If it&rsquo;s your main form of communicating with the world, you want to look into creating one. Those who lead more private lives or those who don&rsquo;t have social media accounts probably don&rsquo;t need a will dedicated to this, as there&rsquo;s no presence to manage.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t just for those with Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram accounts, either &mdash; this is for those who own a blog, site, or other piece of &ldquo;online real estate.&rdquo; If you have a connection with an online community who would be concerned about your lack of activity, you also want to designate someone to control your accounts after you pass.</p><h3> What You Need to Consider</h3><p> <br/> When drafting a social media will, you need to take a few factors into consideration.</p><p> Create a list of usernames and passwords for:</p><li> Each social media platform you use,</li><li> All email accounts you use,</li><li> Any websites or blogs you own,</li><li> Any forums you&rsquo;re a member of, and</li><li> Any other online community you connect with on a regular basis. <br/>  </li><p> Determine exactly how you want your profiles handled after your death, so your family can amend them according to your wishes:</p><li> Do you want them deleted?</li><li> Do you want them maintained?</li><li> Do you want them to stay around permanently, or just for a set period of time?</li><li> If they do stay, should people be allowed to comment? <br/>  </li><p> Try to leave instructions on how those who survive you can handle your social media accounts by reviewing privacy policies of the platforms you use. For example,  <u>  Twitter specifically states </u>  how to request that a user&rsquo;s account be deactivated, and they also require a death certificate. Your will should include that your executor needs a copy of your death certificate.</p><p> It&rsquo;s understandable you might not want to share your social media accounts with certain people, but you need to select one person you can trust enough with the information to serve as your executor. Be sure to review your instructions with that person so they understand how you want everything to be handled.</p><h3> Resources You Can Use</h3><p> <br/> Do you think a social media will is something you should create? Drafting one doesn&rsquo;t have to be difficult. Here are a list of resources you can use that will help:</p><li> <u>  USA.gov </u>  has a useful social media will template in an Excel format you can download, along with a list of considerations to take into account</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.rocketlawyer.com/document/social-media-will.rl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rocket Lawyer  </a> </u>  allows you to draft a social media will</li><li> DeadSocial.org, a UK startup founded in 2012, is one of the leading services for helping individuals and families plan for handling digital assets after death. They have  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.deadsocial.org/resources/social-media-accounts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   full guides  </a> </u>  on how to plan for each major social media platform, as well as blogs and websites. They also offer a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.deadsocial.org/preparing-for-death/social-media-will\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   free planning template for Excel  </a> </u> .</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/social-media-death/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mashable  </a> </u>  has a great infographic that quickly reviews privacy policies and who has a right to the content on your platforms after you pass away.</li><li> If you&rsquo;re wary of keeping a list of username and passwords around (or don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll remember to update it), try an online tool like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.passwordbox.com/legacylocker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Legacy Box  </a> </u> . It allows you to save your passwords and designate an heir to receive them in the event you pass away.</li><h3> Be Prepared</h3><p> <br/> A social media will doesn&rsquo;t have to be an involved document. It shouldn&rsquo;t take you long to make one, and it will make a big difference for your family and friends if you unexpectedly pass away.</p><p> Trying to find the usernames, passwords, or email accounts you use will be difficult when they&rsquo;re grieving. Make things easier by giving them the necessary information and instructions on how you want your digital life managed after you&rsquo;re gone.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-13 17:38:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-13 17:38:18.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_8sQvRj4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/social-media-wills-what-you-need-to-know/\", \"post_id\": \"5411\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-13 17:38:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-13 17:38:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"social-media-wills-what-you-need-to-know\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5410\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2449\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Life-of-Pix-free-stock-fall-cemetery-fell-off-snow-winter-leeroy-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"721\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439551800,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}

And if you&rsquo;re requesting a reply, make that known early on as well.</p><h3> Use sentence case</h3><p> <br/> Avoid using all caps because they don&rsquo;t add emphasis as much as make it appear like YOU&rsquo;RE SHOUTING. That&rsquo;s not the kind of productive communication that drives successful interactions.</p><p> One great way to add emphasis is to use a bullet. In emails, which may be read on any number of devices, try putting an asterisk (*) at the beginning of a new line. It works!</p><h3> Avoid jargon</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s a good idea to use language your readers can understand. This is especially true when you&rsquo;re writing about investing, where jargon may not be as obvious as you think.</p><h3> Include your signature</h3><p> <br/> People read emails on any number of devices: from desktops to laptops, from smartphones to tablets. They read them at work, when they travel and at home. At times, emails are read with the reader&rsquo;s full attention; at other times, a glance is all your email may get.</p><p> The point? In this chaotic world, you need to get people&rsquo;s attention in many different ways. So make sure your recipients know how to contact you. And make sure you give them options.</p><h3> Think twice about &ldquo;reply all&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;ve heard the horror stories, so we won&rsquo;t repeat them here. But it can&rsquo;t hurt to be reminded, can it?</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t forget to say &ldquo;please&rdquo; and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Just like salutations, we learned to say &ldquo;please&rdquo; and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in kindergarten, but sometimes we slip. To ensure you never miss saying &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; you can include it in your email signature.</p><h3> Avoid sarcasm</h3><p> <br/> This is extremely important for all written communications: sarcasm does not work on paper or on screen. It&rsquo;s too subtle and dependent on a speaker&rsquo;s tone of voice.</p><p> Humour is a personal trait. If you have a great sense of humour, you can use it in your email correspondence to lighten the tone. Just be cautious: a misunderstood comment in an email can damage relationships.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-13 17:26:04.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-13 17:26:04.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_42qBYUp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-all-you-need-to-know-about-email/\", \"post_id\": \"5409\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-13 17:26:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-13 17:26:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-all-you-need-to-know-about-email\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5408\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2448\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Life-of-Pix-free-stock-photos-laptop-desktop-plant-cup-leeroy-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"403\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439580600,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2396,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What China's Devaluation Means for the Future of the Dollar","link":"what-chinas-devaluation-means-for-the-future-of-the-dollar","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Simon Black | <a href=\"http://www.sovereignman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Sovereign Man  </u> </a> <br/> Istanbul, Turkey</p><p> As the saying goes, &ldquo;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.&rdquo;</p><p> (&hellip; to which George W. Bush famously added after flubbing the aphorism on live TV, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t fool me again!&rdquo;)</p><p> For months, despite every shred of data pointing to a weaker economy, China&rsquo;s currency has been strengthening.</p><p> This was really counterintuitive. When an economy is weak, its currency tends to suffer.</p><h3> But that didn&rsquo;t happen in China.</h3><p> <br/> Even when China&rsquo;s stock market suffered one of the biggest crashes in history a few weeks ago, the currency barely moved.</p><p> None of this made any sense.</p><p> Just look at Greece&ndash; problems in that single nation, one of the smallest economies in Europe, dragged down the currency used by 18 other nations in Europe to its lowest level in more than a decade.</p><p> But when problems broke in China, the renminbi actually got stronger. And party bosses insisted that they would not devalue their currency.</p><h3> Fool me once.</h3><p> <br/> Yesterday they showed the world what their promises really mean: nothing. And in a surprise announcement, they devalued the renminbi by roughly 2%.</p><p> 2% might not sound like very much. But in currency markets, especially for a major one like China&rsquo;s, 2% is a huge move.</p><p> Curiously, in the very same announcement, Chinese officials stated that they would not devalue the currency again, and that Tuesday&rsquo;s move was a one-time thing.</p><h3> Fool me twice.</h3><p> <br/> Less than 24-hours later they did it again &mdash; a second devaluation that saw the renminbi tumble to as low as 6.57 per US dollar, a 6% decline in roughly 36 hours.</p><p> Again, this is a steep drop for a currency, and I expect that there&rsquo;s more to come.</p><p> (Our Chief Investment Strategist Tim Staermose has been predicting this for quite some time&ndash; premium members, we&rsquo;ll send out an update shortly on his investment recommendations.)</p><p> All of this raises an interesting question about the future of the US dollar.</p><p> Because if an economy as large and powerful as China&rsquo;s has had to concede defeat, does this mean that &ldquo;King Dollar&rdquo; will rule forever?</p><h3> No chance.</h3><p> <br/> Remember that the dollar&rsquo;s strength is derived from its status as the primary global reserve currency.</p><p> Nearly every government, commercial bank, and central bank in the world holds US dollars in reserve, and the dollar is used as the primary currency in global trade.</p><p> Whether in Saudi Arabia or South Africa, a barrel of oil is priced in US dollars. Even jets manufactured in France and sold to European airlines are priced in US dollars.</p><p> But this status is by no means written in stone. The US dollar is not the first global reserve currency, and it won&rsquo;t be the last.</p><p> We can go back in time to the Byzantine solidus, or the Venetian gold ducat, or the Spanish dollar, or the British pound, and see that no reserve currency lasts forever.</p><p> Especially when its fundamentals are so poor.</p><p> The US government is insolvent. Its major institutions and pension funds are insolvent. The central bank is borderline insolvent.</p><p> These are not any wild assertions; their own financial statements admit their insolvency.</p><p> Which means that there&rsquo;s nothing underpinning the dollar&rsquo;s reserve status except confidence.</p><p> And confidence is very fickle. Like a high school popularity contest, it wanes and it booms.</p><p> Right now that confidence is on an upswing, primarily because every other major option looks really bad.</p><p> The euro is acting out its Oedipal complex. Japan is a complete fiscal disaster spending over 25% of tax revenue just to pay interest. And China is rapidly deteriorating.</p><p> Sure there are some outliers like the Swiss franc that are in better shape. But the market for Switzerland&rsquo;s currency is far too small to absorb trillions of dollars in global capital flows.</p><p> In the beauty pageant of major currencies, the US dollar is clearly the least ugly at the moment.</p><p> And I think anyone owning dollars should look at this as a gift.</p><p> Right now we have a tremendous opportunity to sell what&rsquo;s expensive and buy what&rsquo;s cheap.</p><p> The dollar hasn&rsquo;t been this expensive in years. And many non-dollar assets haven&rsquo;t been this cheap&hellip; ever.</p><p> Here in Turkey, the lira is at its lowest level in history. The South African rand is at its lowest level in history. We wrote about Indonesia&rsquo;s rupiah on Monday.</p><p> I&rsquo;m looking at real estate in Colombia at the moment where US dollar buyers can pick up high quality property for less than the cost of construction.</p><p> In Chile, the cheap exchange rate and slowing economy helped our fund to recently close on a farm at $4.3 million that cost $10 million less than two years ago.</p><p> In Australia there are a number of junior mining stocks that are trading for less than the amount of cash that they have in the bank.</p><p> (Again, premium members please expect a forthcoming alert on this.)</p><p> There are countless deals like this all over the world&hellip; especially if you&rsquo;re buying in US dollars.</p><p> It&rsquo;s foolish to expect that any reserve currency will last forever.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s even crazier to expect a reserve currency with such pitiful fundamentals as the US dollar to last forever.</p><p> But markets are not orderly and efficient. They are chaotic.</p><p> Which means that, on rare occasions, enormous opportunities present themselves to buy high quality assets on the cheap.</p><p> That opportunity is now.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-13 15:35:11.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-13 15:35:11.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_ci1mwzi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-chinas-devaluation-means-for-the-future-of-the-dollar/\", \"post_id\": \"5407\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-13 15:35:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-13 15:35:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-chinas-devaluation-means-for-the-future-of-the-dollar\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5406\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2447\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-13-at-9.03.26-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"520\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439553600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2395,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Best Advice My Dad Ever Gave Me","link":"the-best-advice-my-dad-ever-gave-me","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Have you ever thought about the best advice your parents gave you? </strong></p><p> There&rsquo;s probably a long list to pick from &ndash; good and bad.  But now that I have my own children, much of their advice seems to be resurfacing for me.  This includes the all too famous answer to the &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; question &ndash;  &ldquo;Because I said so.&rdquo; Quickly becoming a favorite of my own.</p><p> I want to share how a single piece of advice has taught me multiple lessons through the years.</p><p> My dad would remind me of it regularly, often as he was relaying a story from his own work day&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Your best asset is how well you communicate in front of people.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> He was obviously on to something as the majority of people fear public speaking more than spiders and clowns. I was reminded of this while reading a piece on  <u>  <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/how-to-get-over-the-fear-of-public-speaking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   overcoming your fear of public speaking  </a> </u>  from Ben Carlson at &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A Wealth of Common Sense  </a> </u> &rdquo; recently.</p><h3> &ldquo;If Only&hellip;&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> As a 12 year old boy, my dad suggested I enter an  <u>  oratorical competition </u>  through his local Optimist Club.  Even though I had been in plays and sports in front of bigger crowds, this was the first moment I would have the attention of an audience alone. Needless to say I was petrified.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-3.16.21-PM-2.png\" width=\"495\"/></p><p> Our topic was &ldquo;If Only.&rdquo; And given my love for the Back to the Future Trilogy, I crafted a speech around the idea, &ldquo;If Only I Could See Tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p> I discussed ideas around seeing your future self with all the potential successes and failures (similar to scenes from Back to the Future 2). I also broached ideas of what might happen with the hot button issues of the time &ndash; the  <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100505-science-environment-ozone-hole-25-years/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  hole in the Ozone </a> , the rise of technological advances, and education improvements.</p><p> And I couldn&rsquo;t leave out my fascination with the potential for flying cars.</p><p> To my surprise, the audience liked the speech.</p><p> So much so, I managed to win the local chapter&rsquo;s competition and move on to the regional competition.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-3.16.29-PM-2.png\" width=\"692\"/></p><h3> Lessons Learned</h3><p> <br/> Being a young boy (with questionable hair choices but a decent judge of basketball skill &ndash; see pic above), I was thankful for the opportunity as I learned some valuable lessons through the experience:</p><li> <strong>  Express things clearly  </strong> &ndash; I learned the importance of being able to communicate simply so people understand your message. People hear concepts differently. As a financial advisor and fiduciary, we are required to put our client interests first. We also need to be able to communicate those topics clearly and effectively. This enables people to make measurable changes that actually improve their lives.</li><li> <strong>  Embrace the fear in taking risks </strong>  &ndash; The last thing I wanted to do as a 12 year old was speak to a group of adults about my fantasies of what the future may hold. But embracing the fear helped me to create an incredible experience that&rsquo;s stuck with me ever since. Investing can be just as scary. Whether it is in our retirement accounts, our businesses or ourselves. We all have to make decisions in uncertain situations. But if  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/financial-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   we have a process  </a> </u>  and are prepared for the potential outcomes, our lives can be enriched in ways it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine before taking the risk.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t let ego get the best of you </strong>  &ndash; After winning the first competition, I felt like my head grew a few sizes before the next competition, only to come in second place. This is where having a team or accountability partner can help to remind you of your blind spots. Making a few right calls, or being a top performer can easily go to our heads. Our goal should be to spend time doing the things we do best. We also should strive to control the things we can and then set up accountability relationships to assure we stick to that. This is one reason we use a team approach. Having others to discuss ideas with and share workloads helps us to serve our clients better.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t Worry </strong>  &ndash; Is there any good that ever comes from worry? In my college days, the anticipation of stumbling over words, forgetting my thoughts, or failing miserably in front of older more experienced students would maximize my stress levels. But once the first word was out, things went smoothly. This came from preparation beforehand. Worrying is only good if it motivates us to do something to decrease it. As financial planners, one of our main job requirements is preparing for unexpected scenarios. This helps us think through the potential mental shock, before it actually occurs, preventing us from acting on impulsive emotions in the moment. As a result, our time is free to be used in a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/spending-time-enjoy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more enjoyable way  </a> </u> . <br/>  </li><h3> Fear Doesn&rsquo;t Always End in Failure</h3><p> <br/> On his podcast,  <u>  <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Tim Ferriss Show  </a> </u> , Tim often describes his approach to life as a series of experiments. Instead of failures, he is testing hypotheses to see what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p> This mindset minimizes much of the fear, allowing us to succeed at things we may never try when seeing failure as the downside.</p><p> When planning our financial lives, fear has a way of hijacking our rational thoughts.  The fear of investment losses prevents us from investing  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/waiting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   because stocks are bound to fall  </a> </u> . Then when losses do occur, fear drives us to sell and preserve what we have so we can  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/waiting-until-things-look-better/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   invest when things look better  </a> </u> .</p><p> When facing uncertainty, fear is often a byproduct.  But acting on the fear is what does the damage.  This is where having someone to talk through your decision making helps. Identifying what is preventing you from moving forward helps you begin to re-frame the way it has influenced you in the past.</p><p> Today, I still get butterflies each time I have an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/chad-smith-cfp-speaks-sas-event/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   opportunity to speak  </a> </u> . But now, I see those feelings as more  <u>  <a href=\"http://snip.ly/fq6B#http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rebrand-stage-fright-to-overcome-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   excitement than nervousness  </a> </u> .

{"original_id":2394,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Would Happen If You Had a Blank Canvas?","link":"what-would-happen-if-you-had-a-blank-canvas","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  One of the biggest shifts that is happening in our world today, and there are many, is that many people are starting to wake up to the fact that life is precious and that we have choices. </strong> It's happening every day and taking place quietly especially with people in their 40s, 50s and 60s who are starting to question the judgement system that society has instilled in us.</p><p> Many are achieving career \"success\" and are questioning whether \"this is it.\" They have the corner office (or cube), the salary, the big title and the 24/7 hour on-demand jobs that go with it. And their employers are starting to offer meditation and mindfulness classes as a way for them to figure out their mythical work-life balance. Maybe learning to be still and enjoy the present moment will make all of us better workers?</p><p> In my previous corporate life, I worked with many successful people. I also traveled with them and some years, I think we saw more of each other than our families. We were committed to the success of the company and did whatever it took to make our contributions. We didn't spend so many years getting a great education not to put it into use. And on a trip to Singapore, one of my colleagues was really down. When I asked him what happened, he told me that when he was leaving for the airport, his youngest son had a melt down and told him that he hates [insert company name] and wished he didn't have to work there. It appears that it was a long weekend in Canada and with the time difference, Paul had to leave early to get to Singapore in time for the meeting. His son didn't understand what could be so important to separate a father from his sons so frequently.</p><h3> It's About Choices</h3><p> <br/> When we have our physical and mental health, we can do anything. The only person that gets in our way is ourselves and the stories we tell ourselves. In this story, my colleague was waiting for a promotion to his \"next\" coveted step on the corporate ladder. He was told that if he put in his time, he would get that magical title, salary and prestige. But what they forgot to tell him was that he would never get that time back with his sons. That was gone forever.</p><p> It is not a question of work-life balance any more or even work life integration, which seems like the next story people are telling themselves. It's about how we want to show up in the world. We spend too much time preparing for want we want to bewhen we grow up and not enough time on who we are, what we love and what we don't love.</p><p> The shift that is happening with people in the 40-60 age range is one of hope and opportunity. If we put aside the disappointment that life didn't turn out the way we were told it would and imagine that we have choice, what would happen?</p><h3> Please Stop It</h3><p> <br/> What's happening today is we have conditioned ourselves to numb ourselves with technology, food and being busy. Our fast food culture at work that focuses on efficiency and productivity metrics has killed our ability to create, innovate and more importantly, co-create with others inside or outside our corporate walls.</p><p> And what's the solution of the day? A seven-day sleep away camp to detox ourselves from technology. Technology hasn't done anything to us. Technology can be life changing when we know how to integrate it into our lives. I know it has changed mine on so many levels by connecting me to people around the world that I could talk to so easily.</p><p> I often get asked after I deliver a keynote on the future of work, why I didn't talk about the robots. My answer is that I did by sharing that in the 21st century, we need to create human centered organizations where people are at the heart of business. And that we already have a semi-robotic workforce where decisions are not being made in a 9-5 culture. We need to wake ourselves up from thinking that we are not in control. If you sat with yourself and honestly asked yourself, \"where am I am giving my power away and to who?\" what would you learn?</p><p> I can't offer you the five-step road to success because I don't know you. The first step is to do the hard work and ask yourself some important questions. And it is so easy to reach out to people now because of technology. We live in an open and connected world and we can choose to be isolated or we can choose to find people who we can co-create with. I just co-authored an article for the London Business School Review with an amazing new friend who I only met on a video chat. Tap into your 7-year-old imagination and you'd be amazed at the courage and curiosity you will find within yourself.</p><p> And please, stop it. Stop telling yourself it's hard. Stop telling yourself why you can't do something. Please stop believing the stories you are being told by people who don't know you about how to live your life. Please change the story you tell yourself and then the one you tell others.</p><h3> Your Canvas</h3><p> <br/> I was a \"speed mentor\" at a recent local event and I had seven minutes to give some advice to the participants. I heard many stories from people who wanted help and believe me, seven minutes is not a long time. I didn't prescribe solutions but asked questions so I can be as helpful as possible. Most of the people who were willing to listen, looked at me and said \"wow, I didn't know that I had the answers I have been seeking around me.\" And the ones who were looking for the quick fix were not satisfied by my mentorship.</p><p> Too often we wake up when there is a crisis or a major life change. The time is now. Ask yourself:</p><li> <strong>  How are you showing up in the world? </strong> Are you a whole person who has a life and then work or are you trying to balance two separate selves (professional and personal)?</li><li> <strong>  What do you want to create in your world? </strong> And what did your 7-year-old dream of?</li><li> <strong>  What is your lifework? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What does making a living mean to you? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> And then, imagine you had a blank canvass, regardless of what age you are, what would you put on it?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-12 22:06:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-12 22:06:09.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_W01iX6P.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-would-happen-if-you-had-a-blank-canvas/\", \"post_id\": \"5401\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-12 22:06:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-12 22:06:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-would-happen-if-you-had-a-blank-canvas\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5400\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2445\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-3.08.36-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"868\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439467200,"author_id":48,"chart_url":""}

Hating your job is the cornerstone of a miserable life, so why would you ever want to live like that?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s touch on some important don&rsquo;ts that are sure to keep you in the quicksand of disengagement if you continue these destructive behaviors.</p><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t hang out and talk with others who are constantly putting down the organization you work for.  </strong> Misery loves company. But in this case all it will do is cause you even more unhappiness and dissatisfaction with the workplace. Disengagement is contagious and spreads uncontrollably like an undetected virus.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t fail to take responsibility for your own career. </strong> It&rsquo;s much easier to sit back and complain that you are stuck in a rut.No one will ever care about your professional and personal development in the same way that you do. You are the only one to gain from continual growth.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t stay in a job proven to be unchallenging and unrewarding. </strong>  If you do this for too long you will become numb to the pain that comes with being stuck in place.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t continue to work for a bad or toxic manager. </strong>  They will not magically wake up one day and turn in to a kind and supportive boss. If you are a target of bullying or other abusive behavior at work, you will not come out a winner in this game. In fact, there are only losers.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t continue to work for a company whose business practices you can&rsquo;t support.  </strong> Integrity, ethical practices and trustworthiness are the foundation of a good corporate culture that fosters high engagement. Not having these is a breeding ground for disengagement. <br/>  </li><p> We all need to get rid of the victim mentality.  We might be a target of someone or something, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we brought it on ourselves or deserved the pain. Giving in to the pain and taking on the role of victim has led to many a person to shut down and swim in a sea of disengagement, rather than fight back. It&rsquo;s time to stop the inertia and take steps to reengage and reignite the fire within.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-12 21:31:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-12 21:31:33.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_gH5kicN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-donts-of-disengagement/\", \"post_id\": \"5397\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-12 21:31:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-12 21:31:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-donts-of-disengagement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5396\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2443\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-2.36.00-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"940\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439488800,"author_id":415,"chart_url":""}

Our To Do lists have grown exponentially.</p><p> So how do you create a compelling message to capture advisors attention in less than 30 seconds?</p><p> <strong>  Today's advisor wants you to: </strong></p><p> 1) Know their business: what their challenges are and how to solve them. <br/> 2) Communicate on their terms: understand them at a deeper level to engage them.</p><p> But here's your challenge. You can know their business but if you don't communicate your message in the advisor's style, your message is lost. Translation: NO SALE.</p><p> <strong>  Let's look at an example. </strong></p><p> Paul Holcomb is a top advisor and you have the perfect annuity for him to add to his clients portfolio. His communication style is Lifestyle which means he likes the big picture, enjoys being around people, talkative and always upbeat.</p><p> Your marketing department just emailed him The Top 10 Best Annuities (of course, your annuity is #1). Paul opens the email and all he sees are your logo and lots of words. He immediately deletes it. Why? He prefers bullet points and pictures. All of your cleverly crafted words and details of your #1 ranked annuity did not even register with him!</p><p> Your internal sales desk is part of this campaign so shortly after the email is delivered, they begin making the calls to get advisors educated and excited about this product. Paul is in Ron's territory, so he jumps on the phone to Paul. He takes the call because he knows Ron and your firm. Ron's communication style is Information so he starts the conversation by giving Paul all the pertinent facts and is proud of it because he knows the advisors business!</p><p> What he doesn't know is that Paul stopped listening within a minute. Why? Because Paul wants someone to set the big picture context first and then talk about how other advisors are using it. Details of the product offering are secondary to Paul so he will either ask the questions later or look it up online.But Paul is polite, thanks Ron for calling, and ends the call. Ron feels positive about the call and he continues on with the rest of his calls with the same script.</p><p> Now let's move to the other integral part of this campaign: the external wholesaler. Luckily, Jennifer's communication style is Lifestyle so she presents the annuity to Paul in exactly the way that appeals to Paul. He now understands the annuity, how it differs from the competitor's product, and how to position it in the client's portfolio. SALE IS MADE!</p><p> But what if Jennifer wasn't the same communication style? The three-pronged marketing campaign to promote your #1 ranked annuity would fail on more than half of the advisors. Not because you don't have a good product but simply because you haven't customized your message.</p><h3> Still thinking the soft side of big data doesn't produce revenue?</h3><p> <br/> Maybe now is the time to take a look at a behavioral marketing system that can make a big difference in the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-12 19:15:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-12 19:15:55.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_NVMIbRr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-missing-piece-of-client-engagement/\", \"post_id\": \"5395\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-12 19:15:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-12 19:15:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-missing-piece-of-client-engagement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5394\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2442\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-12.15.36-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"428\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439469000,"author_id":384,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2390,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Hierarchy Takes You from Surviving to Thriving","link":"how-hierarchy-takes-you-from-surviving-to-thriving","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Many leaders believe an effective leader&rsquo;s subordinates consider them a friend. </strong> They feel uncomfortable with hierarchy and/or chain of command and feel everybody in the organization should be treated equally.</p><p> While these misconceptions aren&rsquo;t entirely wrong (your subordinates should believe you respect and appreciate them and everybody in the organization is immensely valuable), when leaders adopt these trains of thoughts, their teams suffer. An established, structured, well communicated, and enforced chain-of-command can eliminate confusion and frustration when it comes to conflict resolution or employee grievances and improve morale and productivity. The word hierarchy may not be well received by leaders or staff, but its effects are positive and necessary for organizational growth.</p><h3> Some of the benefits you can expect to see when you establish and implement a chain of command include: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Improved morale. </strong>  Employees are more likely to see the direct results of their suggestions or grievances when they have addressed it at the closest level first. Leaders are more apt to follow up with their direct employees regarding their grievance. Employees trust that if their supervisor has failed to respond, they have further options for resolution, which improves morale as well.</li><li> <strong>  Decreased legal risk. </strong>  When policy outlines clear guidance for grievances, employees have an obligation to take the steps recommended to resolve complaints. When the grievance or chain of command policy is followed, the organization has increased opportunity to address issues before they reach a judge.</li><li> <strong>  Lower turnover.  </strong> Employees who see action following an appropriate grievance or suggestion are likely to enjoy their jobs and stay on board longer.</li><li> <strong>  Increased productivity.  </strong> Satisfied employees work hard and feel personally vested in the organization. They look for efficiencies and solutions and are driven by quality results.</li><li> <strong>  Lower costs.  </strong> When your turnover and legal risk decrease and your productivity increases, your bottom line goes up. That should provide the justification you need to get your chain-of-command idea past upper management. <br/>  </li><h3> What are the characteristics of an effective chain of command? <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  All employees report directly to somebody who has overall responsibility for their results. </strong> Supervisors who are responsible for the results of their team are personally vested in the performance and productivity of their employees, understand the processes, know the staff, and have the authority to address concerns appropriately. They also have several levels above them for support and guidance.</li><li> <strong>  Few employees report directly to upper management. </strong> Those reporting to upper management have only one option when it comes to grievances. Only the most professional people in the most independent positions in your building should report to the president or CEO.</li><li> <strong>  All employees are trained upon implementation and then annually and upon hire regarding the structure of the organization and the grievance process. </strong> All supervisors are trained to manage authoritatively &ndash; to take personal responsibility for the performance of their team. In order to do so, they must be comfortable directing and correcting their team when necessary (remind them to balance reward and constructive criticism).</li><li> <strong>  Everybody must be willing to say, &ldquo;Have you addressed the right person with these concerns?&rdquo; before they act on concerns that do not come from their direct subordinates. </strong> This enforces chain-of-command and provides maximum opportunity for resolution. <br/>  </li><p> If you choose to establish and implement a chain-of-command, it is vital that your employees understand that it dictates who has the authority to make which decisions and where they should go for help, not who has value within the organization. Employees often view authority as value and poor morale results.</p><p> Furthermore, your leaders must own their authority. Weak or inexperienced leaders often feel that they are no more valuable than anyone else and therefore should not delegate or correct.

Trust matters even more with your peers because it&rsquo;s TECHNICALLY optional and therefore more meaningful and sticky. There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;official&rdquo; accountability levers. It&rsquo;s easy to put them last on your trust-building priority list.</p><p> Your peers aren&rsquo;t evaluating you on an employee engagement survey, or writing your performance appraisal. Often they have competing agendas, and of course you know it&rsquo;s you against them in the stack rank.</p><p> So many of us buckle down, approach our peers with cautious pleasantries, and watch our backs.</p><p> Real trust develops when no one is watching&hellip;when you&rsquo;ve got something to lose, and choose to be vulnerable anyway.</p><h3> 5 Ways to Get Your Peers to Trust You</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Building trusting peer relationships starts with you. Here&rsquo;s how. </strong></p><h3> 1. Get Naked</h3><p> <br/> Well not all the way, but at least take off your parka and mittens. Let them know what scares you (yes, yes, I know getting naked scares you. Do it anyway.) People trust those they can see. Share a vulnerability or two, and then wait for it. It might not happen right away, but stay open and investing as trust grows.</p><h3> 2. Give More Than You Receive</h3><p> <br/> I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve gone into a company and seen two teams with the same objectives, doing the same work, both with best practices that they&rsquo;re completely keeping to themselves. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you mine if you show me yours&rdquo; is old school. Show your great idea first without worrying about what comes next.</p><h3> 3. Take a Field Trip</h3><p> <br/> I learned this from one of my direct reports in my sales exec role. His peers in the finance department were not approving contracts for a subset of our customers. My deeply southern district manager got in the car and drove three hours for an old-fashioned visit. They had some sweet tea, cleared up misconceptions, developed a streamlined communication protocol, and our acceptance rate for that market skyrocketed. These were qualified customers that &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t look good on paper.&rdquo; But the paper didn&rsquo;t do them justice.</p><h3> 4. Lose a Battle</h3><p> <br/> You don&rsquo;t care equally about every issue. Know what&rsquo;s worth going to the mat for, and what isn&rsquo;t. A few concessions can gain you the reputation of being &ldquo;easy to work with.&rdquo; When you really need something, they&rsquo;ll be more likely to trust your motives.</p><h3> 5. Lift Them Up</h3><p> <br/> As a customer service director, my friend Dan and I stumbled on this one by accident. We were peers (who were always stack ranked against one another), but we also realized we had different gifts. I&rsquo;m embarrassed to admit, he went first. He rolled up his sleeves and helped me tremendously on the operations side. He even silently sat in on a few tough customer calls and privately messaged me with what to do while I was getting my sea legs.</p><p> I then came to his region and helped him attack his employee engagement issues.</p><p> In every operations review we genuinely credited one another with our success. A high-tide rises all boats.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t overlook the importance of trust amongst peers. It&rsquo;s harder, it makes a difference, the big guys notice, and the relationships last a lifetime. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-12 17:36:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-12 17:36:19.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_FECzIFz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-do-i-get-my-peers-to-trust-me/\", \"post_id\": \"5391\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-12 17:36:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-12 17:36:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-do-i-get-my-peers-to-trust-me\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5390\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2440\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-10.45.45-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"668\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439477100,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}

So it should come as no surprise that job candidates are looking for jobs that offer meaningful work in addition to good pay.</p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://millennialbranding.com/2014/multi-generational-job-search-study-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2014 study from Millennial Branding and beyond.com  </a> </u>  asked workers what were the most important benefits they considered when selecting an employer. Here&rsquo;s what the respondents said:  30% highlighted salary and 30% chose meaningful work </p><p> There&rsquo;s a bonus for employers, too. A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/opinion/sunday/why-you-hate-work.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">   2014 Energy Project survey  </a> </u>  found that employees who derive meaning and significance from their work were more than three times as likely to stay with their organizations. They also reported higher job satisfaction and engagement levels.</p><p> In some industries, finding meaningful work is inherent in the job description. Each year  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.payscale.com/data-packages/most-and-least-meaningful-jobs/full-list\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PayScale  </a> </u>  puts out a list of the most meaningful jobs. The perennial winners are the usual suspects: clergy, surgeons, firefighters, therapists, kindergarten teachers, etc. tend to find the most meaning in their jobs.</p><p> But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that meaningful jobs don&rsquo;t exist outside of these specific career paths. In fact, employers who work on making any job more meaningful give employees a reason to stay.</p><p> How do you infuse meaning into a 9-to-5 office job? For a job to be meaningful, it has to be fulfilling on some level, whether it&rsquo;s achieving a personal goal or helping to save the world. We&rsquo;re using three distinct categories &mdash; personal, organizational, and community &mdash; to talk about ways in which you can provide that meaning.</p><h3> Personal Fulfillment</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  #1. Fulfill professional dreams:  </strong> Many employees find significance at work when they&rsquo;re allowed to advance themselves on their own merit. Give them the chance to do so with a formalized career advancement program within your organization, or help them build on-the-job skills that they can use to score that big promotion. Plus, employees who get the chance to develop within an organization are more likely to stick around, according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/182228/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup  </a> </u>  researchers. </p><p> <strong>  #2. Celebrate personal talents:  </strong> Your employees have a life outside work from which they derive meaning. Blur the lines between professional and personal by inviting employees to showcase their talents. Set aside an hour each week for music lessons, art lessons, yoga classes, and anything else your employees are good at.</p><p> <strong>  #3. Provide a social space: </strong>  A meaningful work environment is one that cares about its employees and how they interact with each other. Build social time into the fabric of your workplace, whether that&rsquo;s just a respite from day-to-day activity or specialized groups &mdash; for example, supporting new moms and dads. Spending time with colleagues reinforces connections between individuals and also contributes to better teamwork.</p><h3> Fulfillment in the Organization</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  #1. Recognize employees: </strong>  Organizations with formalized recognition programs see higher levels of engagement and retention. Recognition also contributes to a more meaningful experience at work because employees feel valued for what they contribute. Be sure to highlight the achievements of both individuals and teams, and showcase the impact of employees&rsquo; daily work to overall company goals.</p><p> <strong>  #2. Stick to your values:  </strong> A values-based mission statement that guides everyday actions is invaluable in making employees feel like they&rsquo;re part of something bigger beyond their daily routine. It&rsquo;s crucial, though, that values be embraced from top to bottom. Researchers  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/12/to-give-your-employees-meaning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer  </a> </u>  note, &ldquo;Unfortunately, far too often, mission statements turn out to be empty lip service to values that aren&rsquo;t lived every day by managers inside the organization. So this is the leader&rsquo;s second task: walking the talk of the mission statement.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  #3. Promote mentorship: </strong>  An organization is made up of its disparate parts, but one way for those parts to feel more cohesive is through guidance from others. Mentorship is crucial at every stage of an employees&rsquo; career, but particularly important at the beginning. A formalized mentorship program helps junior employees get the coaching and training they need from more experienced colleagues. It not only promotes bonding between coworkers, but also highlights the company&rsquo;s investment in each employee.</p><h3> Fulfillment in the Community</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  #1. Encourage volunteering: </strong>  A company-wide volunteer program is one successful way to encourage your employees to give back to the community, but you don&rsquo;t have to limit yourself to a monthly outing at a local soup kitchen. Many of your employees likely volunteer in their free time. Give them the chance to support an organization they care about by factoring volunteering time into their work week. Use your employees&rsquo; talents to do pro-bono work in the field that they&rsquo;re the experts in, partnering up with a local school or nonprofit for maximum impact.</p><p> <strong>  #2. Be a socially responsible partner:  </strong> Corporate social responsibility has become a buzzword, but it&rsquo;s a big way in which a company of any size can commit to making a difference in the world. This matters to employees, 35% of whom say they&rsquo;d take a 15% pay cut if it meant working for a socially responsible company, according to a survey from  <u>  <a href=\"https://netimpact.org/sites/default/files/documents/what-workers-want-2012-summary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   nonprofit Net Impact  </a> </u> .  By integrating social and environmental concerns into their business model, socially responsible organizations are telling employees and consumers that they care about the community they live in. The possibilities are endless, but here are a few ideas: opt for a paperless workplace, cut down on water usage, choose to work with suppliers located in your region, commit to paying above the average median wage, invest in emerging markets, etc.</p><p> <strong>  #3. Help employees give back:  </strong> Many organizations match their employees&rsquo; charitable donations, which is a fantastic financial incentive to donate. Take this idea one step further by offering small internal grants that employees can invest in their favorite causes. Encourage employees to come up with innovative solutions to community problems by offering them exploratory funding. If funding isn&rsquo;t within your budget, try other incentives like a day off from work.</p><p> By the law of averages, not all workers end up in their career of choice or an inherently meaningful job. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that their work can&rsquo;t be without significance. Meaning comes in all shapes and sizes, so it&rsquo;s on companies to find ways to help employees fulfill personal goals, feel invested in the organization, and give back to the community. By figuring out what makes employees derive more meaning from work, employers will make their employees happier, prouder, and more loyal.</p> <p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-12 17:12:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-12 17:12:01.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_12QOcrW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-make-work-actually-mean-something-to-employees/\", \"post_id\": \"5389\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-12 17:12:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-12 17:12:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-make-work-actually-mean-something-to-employees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5388\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2439\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439392803233-3c1427203528-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"463\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439478000,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}

This is where our kids learn to budget, handle credit cards, save and invest. Parents don't need to be experts, they just need to share what they do know.</p><p> Now contrast the well-to-do father I met on the plane with April Williams, a single mom who had struggled with money issues her whole life. April openly shared her own painful lessons about money with her teenage son. The outcome for her son,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCTEPzSjvVw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chicago teen Damon Williams  </a> </u> , could be just the inspiration you need to have the big &lsquo;money talk&rsquo; with your own kids.</p><p> When Damon was in middle school he bugged his mom to buy him some expensive Nikes, she talked to him about saving and spending and the power of investing. She told him instead of just buying these expensive shoes, he had to save up and buy at least one share of stock in Nike before he could get the shoes. That lesson was to think about owning a piece of the business, not just the product. This concept prompted Damon to get excited about investing. Before his fifteenth birthday, Damon Williams had an impressive investment portfolio worth almost $50,000. <strong>  Damon is proof that kids with basic math skills can grasp the fundamentals of investing. </strong></p><p> While parents assume kids are learning some personal finance lessons in school, the reality is that right now,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.councilforeconed.org/policy-and-advocacy/survey-of-the-states/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   only 17 states  </a> </u>  require students to study personal finance in order to graduate from high school. That's according to a survey by the Council for Economic Education. Practical, real life lessons that come straight from you are the gift that will truly keep on giving.</p><h3> Imagine how much grief you can save your kid (and yourself) if he or she actually knew a little something about money by college. </h3><p> <br/> The good news is that it&rsquo;s never too early or late to start.  Okay, maybe you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re the best role model for money behavior. Just like April Williams, you may have made too many money mistakes in your own life to be a good role model. But with open, honest conversations, your problems will serve as a powerful lesson for your son or daughter. Pass along your experiences &ndash; the good, bad and ugly.</p><p> In fact, if your child has watched you struggle with debt, foreclosure, impulse shopping, the loss of a job or other financial worries, he or she may be especially receptive to your message that it&rsquo;s important to learn some different habits. </p><p> For those who are managing money well, you aren&rsquo;t doing your child any favors by protecting them from financial realities. Of course, you don&rsquo;t want to burden them with excessive anxiety about the roof over their heads. But talking openly about your spending and saving choices and how much you spend each month in major categories will give them an important context.</p><p> There are so many great resources available to help you. One of my favorite organizations is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cajumpstart.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jump$tart  </a> </u> , which is dedicated to improving youth financial literacy. (Full disclosure: I sit on the board of the California chapter.)</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.moneyasyougrow.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Money as You Grow  </a> </u>  is another great site dedicated to teaching kids the top 20 things they need to know, age by age, to live financially smart lives.

{"original_id":2385,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Moving at the Speed of Innovation","link":"moving-at-the-speed-of-innovation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Do you think that the speed of innovation is too fast for your customers? Or just right? Do you know how your customers feel about the pace? </strong> <br/> <br/> I was reading about the  <u>  2015 Edelman Trust Barometer </u>  the other day and saw this finding: <br/> <br/> More than half of the global informed public believe that the pace of development and change in business today is too fast, that business innovation is driven by greed and money rather than a desire to improve people&rsquo;s lives and that there is not enough government regulation of many industry sectors. <br/> <br/> I'm curious how that differed by age/age groups but was only able to find that \"informed public\" respondents were 25-64, with no breakdown by age group.  <br/> <br/> Only 30% of respondents believed that improving people's lives was a catalyst for change/innovation, and only 24% felt innovation was driven by a desire to make the world a better place. So if you're not innovating for your customers, for whom are you innovating? Apparently respondents felt that technology, business growth, and greed are the top three drivers of innovation.  <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://bgr.com/2012/10/25/apple-ipad-4-consumer-reaction-survey-toluna-quicksurveys/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Toluna QuickSurveys  </a> </u>  found that 45% of US iPad owners were not happy about the timing of the new iPad 4 launch (only 7 months after the release of the latest iPad 3).</p><h3> Was that greed? or innovation?</h3><p> <br/> Are companies upgrading and updating too quickly? Are they offering new features and functionality at a pace that customers can't keep up with? And not necessarily with regards to purchasing the latest gadgets but also from the perspective of, \"Hey, I'm still trying to figure out this one. Now you've built a new one with a zillion more features I'll need to learn.\" Is that driven by greed? Is that truly innovation? Or is that just the normal enhancement of products in the product cycle? <br/> <br/> And yet, innovation is important to the growth of a business, to developing new categories or businesses or industries, and, ultimately, to improving lives/making the world a better place, so it's sad that the perception is that companies innovate because of greed and a misguided focus (on themselves rather than on customers). Perhaps some do. <br/> <br/> I read in another article that you have to innovate both to prepare for change and to make change. If you don't innovate, then you'll always do what you're doing today; you'll remain stagnant; your competitors will sail past you; and your customers will get bored and leave. Unless, of course, no companies innovate, or they all slow innovation, and then we'll just all be bored. Imagine if you were still walking around with a  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman\" target=\"_blank\">   Walkman  </a> </u>  today. And isn't it more convenient and fun to scan Netflix for a movie you want to watch than to walk into a  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC\" target=\"_blank\">   Blockbuster  </a> </u>  - assuming it's open when you want to watch that movie - hoping that one of their five copies of your chosen movie is available? <br/> <br/> The Edelman findings go on to say that: Building trust is essential to successfully bringing new products and services to market, and building trust in new business innovations requires that companies demonstrate clear personal and societal benefits, behave with integrity and engage with customers and stakeholders throughout the process.</p><h3> The last point is an important one.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Innovation can't be done in a vacuum. Or, as   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.jeremygutsche.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Jeremy Gutsche   </a>  </u>   says: Innovation starts by intimately observing your customer. If you want to innovate for your customers, you need to engage with them, listen to them, understand who they are and what they're trying to do, and so much more - but most importantly, you need to understand what they are trying to do: what task, what job, what are they trying to achieve. </strong></p><h3> So how do you know if you're innovating too fast?</h3><p> <br/> Should you be moving at the speed of innovation? or at the speed of customer? <br/> <br/> In Michael Schrage's HBR article,  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/11/are-you-driving-too-much-change.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Are You Driving Too Much Change, Too Fast?  </a> </u>  he states:</p><p> The issue is less about how fast CEOs are willing to move than how quickly their most reliable customers are prepared to change. The most effective and important diagnostic I&rsquo;ve observed for assessing organizational speed and tempo appears obvious but underappreciated: How fast are your customers willing to change? Your own rate of change is determined less by the quality or price/performance of your offerings than the measurable readiness of your customers and clients. Their internal readiness matters more than yours. Their inertia matters more than your momentum.</p><p> Bottom line: it always comes down to listening to your customers.  <br/> <br/> What do you think? Some say that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/06/do-customers-know-what-they-need.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customers don't know what they want/need  </a> </u> , so how then can they tell you at what pace they are willing to change? Can they be trained to change or turn on a dime, as Michael Schrage states has happened in some industries (mobile, computers, social media)?</p><p> When you innovate, you've got to be prepared for people telling you that you are nuts. -Larry Ellison</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-12 15:50:25.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-12 15:50:25.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_o6GYQr5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/moving-at-the-speed-of-innovation/\", \"post_id\": \"5383\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-12 15:50:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-12 15:50:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"moving-at-the-speed-of-innovation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5382\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2436\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-8.50.34-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"482\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439639100,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

Continued industry evolution and market forces are increasing the odds that many RIA firms will be challenged to sustain any growth momentum they&rsquo;ve enjoyed over the last five years.   Rapid change in technology, the change in customer behavior, the surge in competitive forces and the plateauing of the AUM-fee model are just some of the reasons to be concerned for the growth of RIA firms.</p><p> Make no mistake, I am nothing but bullish on the concept of independent advisory businesses charging a fee for quality investment advice.

It&rsquo;s not a question of whether or not consumers will really want to deal with their financial advisor via the web &ndash; most consumers are already using mobile and web solutions to monitor their bank accounts, pay bills, read up on savings options and more. When it comes down to life&rsquo;s difficult decisions &ndash; can I pay for my children&rsquo;s education? When can I retire? How do we divide our assets after divorce? &ndash; a quality advisor&rsquo;s role is irreplaceable.The solution; make sure your firm&rsquo;s digital client interaction tools are best of breed and are compatible with mobile, but don&rsquo;t forget to pick up the phone and cement the value of the human aspect of the relationship.</p><h3> Marketing has become a more fragmented exercise than ever before.  </h3><p> <br/> Do you have a good e-mail marketing strategy? Do you leverage LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube? Have you executed on any good events to appeal to current and future clients? What attention have you given your website? Do you have a search engine strategy? Is your company news and expertise being covered and included in the news coverage of issues that impact your clients?   If you are getting tired of reading my litany of questions, then you get the point that there are so many places to tell your story and support your position and value in the marketplace.</p><h3> When business seems to be growing &ldquo;all by itself,&rdquo; it is precisely the time to invest in new growth initiatives.  </h3><p> <br/> If you run or work for an advisory firm that earns fees based on assets under management, there is a good bet that your firm has seen revenue increase over the last five years as the performance of the markets has outstripped the yearly 3 to 6 percent distributions your clients are taking.  The growth of your business that is attributed to investment performance rather than new client acquisition can help fund investments in new marketing activities. Why wait until your business is suffering to modernize your marketing and communication approach?</p><p> The rise of tech-enabled advisors, the race for quality human capital, the attack on the &ldquo;1 percent on assets&rdquo; fee model and the inevitable decline of the equity markets are just some of the current threats to the conventional RIA business.   <strong>  If you&rsquo;re not changing how you market, how you engage your clients and how much you invest back in your business, the challenges may be too much to overcome and the next five years could bring a swift fall for some stuck-in-their-ways RIA firms. </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-12 15:07:50.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-12 15:07:50.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_ZAPrdTI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/complacency-kills-dont-let-your-ria-firms-growth-flat-line/\", \"post_id\": \"5381\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-12 15:07:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-12 15:07:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"complacency-kills-dont-let-your-ria-firms-growth-flat-line\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5380\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2435\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-8.32.17-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"711\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439465400,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2383,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Find Peace in Life","link":"how-to-find-peace-in-life","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  As he sat huddled in that cold, dark trench with bombs exploding all around him was a young Hungarian soldier thinking to himself, &ldquo;there must be a better way to live.&rdquo; </strong> But, \"how to find peace in the midst of war\", that was the question burning in his conscience. That young Hungarian soldier fighting in the First World War was my grandfather, the late Julius John Kubassek.</p><p> As he crawled out of the trench he had spent the night in, he quickly realized that only two other soldiers had survived the attack. They had both spent the night in the same trench he had; one had been on his left, the other on his right. That was all he could take. He'd had enough of the war and all the killing that was going on.</p><p> He kept thinking to himself, &ldquo;there must be a better way.&rdquo; Fed up, he stuck the bayonet of his gun into the ground and refused to take up arms from that moment on. He defected from the Hungarian army. He chose to follow his convictions with the risk of imprisonment rather than follow the orders he had been given to kill his fellowman.</p><p> My grandfather spent the next six weeks hiding in a cave under the pigpen on his parents&rsquo; far. It was here he had plenty of time to do some serious thinking. He began to think about the war and how God, who had created all of us certainly would not condone us killing each other. He also began to read the New Testament. As he studied the Book of Acts he realized that the first church had lived together and had all things in common. No one called anything their own. Wow, he thought, &ldquo;what a concept....what a peaceful way to live&rdquo; if we lived that way today there would be no need for war.</p><p> Realizing that peace was something that needed to pursued and sought after, my grandfather decided to follow his dream of finding such a place. A place of peace and harmony where everyone lived together and shared their possessions. A place where people lived to serve each other. A place where nobody called anything their own.</p><p> He realized a dream without a plan was useless. He realized that a plan without action was just as useless. However, taking action means choice. Taking no action is also a choice; it&rsquo;s choosing to do nothing. He could choose to stay with his family and his familiar surroundings, or he could choose to follow his dream. Even though it meant taking a great risk, he chose to follow his dream. So one night he left his family and friends and his homeland, in search of his dream, running at night and hiding in the woods by day.</p><p> When my grandfather finally reached the border he was stopped by a guard and asked for his travel papers. Unable to produce the correct documents, he simply asked the guard if he had anything better. Miraculously, the guard gave my grandfather his own papers, allowing him to cross the border into Austria. It&rsquo;s amazing what happens when we know our purpose, have a plan and are persistent in following it. It&rsquo;s also amazing what happens when you ask.</p><p> In search of his dream he began to attend a Baptist church in Vienna, where he brought up his idea of living together and sharing earthly possessions. The people in the church thought it was a great idea and suggested he travel to America where there was plenty of wealth, get a job, and bring back to Austria enough money to buy land and start a commune. </p><p> Grandpa wasn&rsquo;t about to let his dream die. If following his dream meant sailing to a country he knew very little about except that it was a land of opportunity, he would do it. It didn&rsquo;t matter if he couldn&rsquo;t speak the language, had little money and no contacts. He had faith in himself and he had faith in God. He didn&rsquo;t need any more than that.</p><h3> By the time my grandfather arrived in America it was the 1930s and he couldn&rsquo;t even buy a job.</h3><p> <br/> He spent weeks walking from one factory to the next, asking if they had a job for him. But he was not about to give up after he had come this far; besides, he had only purchased a one-way ticket to America. There was no going back, so he decided to check out the possibilities in Canada. He walked across Ambassador Bridge on foot, and he applied for and got a job at Ford Motor Company as a tool and die maker. He finally had the job he had come so far to find.</p><h3> Many times in life, we are just one bridge away from success.</h3><p> <br/> We give up because we lose sight of our purpose. Grandpa had been persistent; he never gave up in his search for his dream&mdash;a place of harmony and peace, a place where people lived together and shared all things. Not finding his dream, he created it. In 1940, with a net worth of 6 cents and a vendor who offered 100 percent financing, my grandfather purchased a 200-acre farm near Kitchener, Ontario, and there he founded the Community Farm of the Brethren. His dream had come true! It was in that community that my life began.</p><p> The lessons I've learned about living a peaceful life from my grandfather's experience and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/7-laws-of-success-from-the-farm/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   growing up in the commune  </a> </u>  are lessons that have helped me maintain my inner peace to this day:</p><p> <strong>  1. Peace always comes with a price. </strong> However, peace is something everyone wants but not all are willing to pay for. The price is usually letting the other person have the final word and just walking away.</p><p> <strong>  2. There are times when peace can only be found in a new place. </strong> Perhaps it means changing jobs. It could mean moving to different neighborhood. It may mean moving to new country like my grandfather did.</p><p> <strong>  3. The people we associate with have a great determining influence on the level of peace we are able to attain. </strong> Without unity there can be no peace. </p><p> <strong>  4. Sometimes it takes pain for us to discover peace. </strong> When the pain of chaos, abuse or turmoil becomes greater than the fear of choosing a path of peace out of our situation we finally take the first step. Happiness is what we think we want. There can be no happiness without peace.</p><p> <strong>  5. Living a life of peace always includes gratitude, thanksgiving and praise. </strong> The most important is the relationship we can have with our Creator. Religion never brings peace, right relationship always does. Right relationships include respect, honor and love. Things we all have within ourselves to give. </p><p> Past choices may have prevented peace but today is a new day and the way to peace for you may be some necessary endings and a new beginning. That is easier said than done. Especially when those past choices include a spouse, an employer, or even a best friend.</p><p> What do you need to bring to an end in order to bring peace into your life? What do you need to begin in order to bring peace into life?</p><p> &ldquo;Those who are at war with others are not at peace with themselves.&rdquo; William Hazlitt&hellip;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-12 14:57:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-12 14:57:44.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_pmPvc4T.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-find-peace-in-life/\", \"post_id\": \"5379\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-12 14:57:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-12 14:57:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-find-peace-in-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5378\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2434\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-7.56.14-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"503\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439493300,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2382,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The 5 Biggest Misconceptions About Content Marketing","link":"the-5-biggest-misconceptions-about-content-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As content marketing continues to grow in popularity (and for good reason!), I have also observed the growing number of misconceptions emerging about content marketing and what it actually is.  More and more businesses are interested in adopting this perspective of marketing, but few and fewer seem to be doing it correctly.  So, let&rsquo;s all start your marketing efforts off right in the New Year by first debunking a few of the biggest content marketing myths out there today.  You don&rsquo;t need to be marketing machine to get content marketing right, but you definitely need to avoid these five misconceptions:</p><h3> 1. Content = Content Marketing</h3><p> <br/> People everywhere: a blog post or YouTube video does not equate to content marketing.  Just because you have some content on your website and are creating some interesting posts here and there on social channels, does NOT mean that you are doing content marketing.   <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/what-is-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Content Marketing Institute </a>  defines content marketing clearly as a&hellip; &ldquo;Marketing technique of creating and distributing valuable, relevant and consistent content to attract andacquire a clearly defined audience &ndash; with the objective of driving profitable customer action.&rdquo;  In other words, content marketing is a long-term system of strategically planned pieces of content created for the sole purpose of adding value to a very specific audience that organically leads to actual profit.  Content outside of this strategic, measurable system is just white noise that lands on deaf ears.</p><h3> 2. If You Write It, They Will Come</h3><p> <br/> Have you ever written a fantastic blog article that took you too many hours, and when you finally had it buttoned-up and publish-perfect, you hit that shiny &ldquo;publish&rdquo; button holding your breath in anticipation of the thousands of people waiting to see your words crawl across their feeds!&hellip; only to be disappointed that it was shared maybe a handful of times? This has something to do with my first point and relates to the important notion of having not only a strategy for the content you create and for whom, but also how you promote it and which media channels you use when.  Many of my esteemed peers have written amazing articles about ways to start or enhance a business blog and gain more blog subscribers.  And the reason why there are so many helpful tips out there for blogging is because it&rsquo;s a very crowded space that takes more effort than simply hitting &ldquo;publish&rdquo; these days.  This can certainly be discouraging to businesses just starting out with blogging or trying to jump-start their efforts again, because it&rsquo;s consistency over time that leads to lasting organic results.</p><h3> 3. It&rsquo;s a New Way of Marketing</h3><p> <br/> Not really.  I tend to think it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;refresh&rdquo; of what talented marketers have always done, but with new tools that allow us to do it even better.  It is not as if marketers woke up in these last two years and thought, &ldquo;Eureka! I know! We need to identify and create strategy around specific target audiences!&rdquo;  That certainly isn&rsquo;t the case.  What has changed is marketer&rsquo;s abilities to engage with consumers in meaningful and relevant ways as a result of online social platforms that simply didn&rsquo;t exist years ago.  Content marketing demonstrates a renewed application of fundamental marketing principles in order to successfully raise brand awareness, attract new customers, engage audiences, convert strangers to leads, close, and then delight customers. The cycle is the same, but the methods and means to guide that cycle are ever changing and will continue to evolve with the way the consumer gathers information and makes purchasing decisions.</p><h3> 4. It&rsquo;s Not That Time Consuming</h3><p> <br/> Actually. It is.  There is no other way I can slice this, other than tell you that anything worth the reward takes hard work.  Content marketing is absolutely not your &ldquo;get results fast&rdquo; gimmick, nor did it ever pretend to be.  It is, without apology, a long-game strategy.  I like to equate content marketing to a personal trainer, because long-lasting, sustainable results requires the commitment to work hard, be consistent, make some life-style changes, and stick with it.  Content marketing is exactly the same way.  In order to reach your content marketing goals, it takes time to first build the foundation needed to sustain a healthy program, with occasional change-ups to prevent plateauing.  Then, even when you get into a good rhythm and all is well, you can&rsquo;t ride the wave of complacency, because the minute you stop working &ndash; you start losing what you&rsquo;ve worked so hard to build.  Content marketing is really about establishing good content creation and sharing habits so that you can sustain your efforts.  Automation programs help to streamline parts of the process, but just like a treadmill can&rsquo;t run for you &ndash; automation can&rsquo;t replace you either.</p><h3> 5. It Doesn&rsquo;t Require a Separate Strategy</h3><p> <br/> Yes it does and anyone who suggests otherwise doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing.  He who has a map, gets to where he wants to go.  Content marketing without a documented strategy is very unwise.  Because you are creating content for each stage of the sales cycle and then have campaigns running concurrently to nurture people within these various stages &ndash; I cannot, for the life of me, understand how anyone could keep it all organized without a strategy and content calendar.  It would be pure chaos. Not to mention, if you don&rsquo;t follow a strategic plan with KPIs and other important metrics, you won&rsquo;t be able to accurately measure and quantify marketing effectiveness.  Organization is necessary to successfully execute content marketing efforts.</p><p> These are five of the biggest misconceptions I&rsquo;ve seen about content marketing in recent months.

{"original_id":2381,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do You Dare?","link":"do-you-dare","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Brene Brown begins  <strong>  Daring Greatly </strong>  (2012) with a passage from Theodore Roosevelt's \"Citizenship in a Republic\" speech which is all about stepping in the \"arena,\" taking a risk, and being vulnerable. Brene asserts that vulnerability is not a weakness. \"Our willingness to own and engage with our vulnerability determines the depth of our courage and the clarity of our purpose; the level to which we protect ourselves from being vulnerable is a measure of our fear and disconnection.\"  Brown continues by saying when we wait until we are perfect before we take action, we may lose opportunities or damage relationships. Our call to action is to \"show up and let ourselves be seen.\"  <br/> <br/> Showing up is scary.  <br/> <br/> Last week, I had the opportunity to attend a legislative breakfast and discussion forum focused on women's issues. I think I may have first learned about the event from a local publication's newsletter, I can't recall for sure. When I saw the brief description of the event, I wasn't really clear if the \"general public\" was invited to attend, or if you were supposed to be some kind of somebody in order to go.  <br/> <br/> As recently as two years ago, if I hadn't been sure, I wouldn't have gone. I wouldn't have wanted to show up some where I wasn't \"supposed to be.\"  But the topic was intriguing to me so I put it on my calendar anyway. The morning of the event, I started second guessing my decision to go. All the typical questions ran through my head: (What if I'm not supposed to be there? What if I don't know anyone? How am I supposed to dress? I don't do \"politics\" so should I stay home? ...on and on...) <br/> <br/> I went anyway. I rationalized that worse case scenario was that I learned when I got there that I wasn't supposed to be there. So then I would leave.  <br/> <br/> And I'm glad I went! I met some new people and ran into others that I knew. I engaged in wonderful dialogue with a group of women who were all also there because they care about women's issues. I participated in round table discussions and shared my ideas.  <br/> <br/> My fears were unfounded. There was no expectation that anyone there was going to know everything or have all the answers. Any idea was a good idea. They seemed to be truly looking for discussion, ideas, and action!  <br/> <br/> I left so inspired, for a few reasons. First, there were some very young women there (even one still in high school!). These young women gave me hope for the future. Second, it seemed to be a supportive community of women who were there to learn and do their part to advance a cause they cared about.  Third, I received many wonderful ideas not only about how I can get involved and support solutions to these issues, but I also received ideas that I can apply in my business. Immediately. And beyond that, I saw connection to other volunteer and community-based organizations to which I belong. ( <u>  Read a summary of what I learned on a recent LinkedIn blog post on this topic </u> ) <br/> <br/> If I hadn't shown up, if I had let me fear overcome my interest, if I had opted to stay safe and protected in my safe little shell, then I would have missed out on a wonderfully impactful experience.  <br/> <br/> This is only one small example of how vulnerability and fear shows up in my life. When I let it keep me in my shell, I miss out on the possibility of what could otherwise be.  <br/> <br/> When we stay safe or small, we can't win. And to quote Brene once more, \"there really is no triumph without vulnerability.\"  <br/> <br/> <strong>  For Reflection </strong> <br/> Where are you playing safe or small in your life?  <br/> How will you dare to dream big? </p> ","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-11 20:30:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-11 20:30:55.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_nBTtyiv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-dare/\", \"post_id\": \"5373\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-11 20:30:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-11 20:30:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-dare\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5372\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2431\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-1.31.44-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"458\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439398800,"author_id":468,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2380,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Facing and Overcoming Your Inner Imposter","link":"facing-and-overcoming-your-inner-imposter","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Even the most accomplished leaders can feel like frauds. Whether it be low self-confidence or deeper insecurity, they simply doubt their competence and feel their success is mainly in fooling those around them.</p><p> I noticed it among colleagues when I was a corporate executive, and in the last 10 years, fairly regularly, while coaching others. When it came down to it, many believed they were faking it -- and if people discovered the truth, they'd be horrified. <br/> <br/> Of course there are incompetent leaders, and we all know a few. Yet the majority of \"frauds\" are self-misconceptions that melt away with self-awareness and experience or, if left to fester, become a self-fulfilling prophecy. <br/> <br/> <strong>  How it evolves </strong> <br/> <br/> It's a classic trap: many attain positions of increasingly senior leadership as rewards for doing well in their current jobs, rather than for being ready to lead at a higher level.  <br/> <br/> When taking on a bigger job most of us will quietly notice, \"I don't really know what I'm doing yet.\" Typically, this is appropriate self-awareness, and disappears with training and experience. Those more prone to feeling a fraud may simply forget about the word \"yet,\" and doubt their basic legitimacy in the role. <br/> <br/> Then it becomes an increasingly vicious circle over time. They want to appear confident, which they do by hiding their new-in-role lack of proficiency from being \"found out.\" They will either people-please, be arrogant, or autocratic. In each case, it causes a reluctance to seek the information, skills, training, and help from colleagues they need -- all avoided as risky signs of \"weakness.\"  <br/> <br/> As they starve themselves of needed support in order to show that they know what they're doing, they short-circuit their own competence and actual ability to do a good job. Ultimately, they'll create the exact problem they were trying to hide from others.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  What to do about it </strong></p><p> 1. Understand you're in good company <br/> <br/> I find most clients with some level of fraud feelings are relieved to learn they're not alone. It immediately puts their own \"fraud\" conception in doubt, as it shows they are in the company of extraordinary leaders and successful people everywhere. <br/> <br/> 2. Tackle -- rather than attempt to hide -- what you don't know <br/> <br/> If you are reluctant to avail yourself of help, support, or learning, understand that it may be a result of an attempt to \"fake it.\" It's important to remember in those situations, as John F. Kennedy said, \"Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.\" Make a list of things you need to learn or understand better, prioritize it, and tackle the items in order, by studying, asking colleagues for help, getting coaching, etc. I've had my senior executive clients do this, and it's worked like a charm.  <br/> <br/> 3. Feelings of fraud can't survive strong self-awareness <br/> <br/> Start catching yourself when the direct feeling of fraud, imposter, or fear of \"being found out\" comes up, and take a mental pause. Recognize that it's a distortion of the situation and dismiss it. As you build your mental muscles to catch and correct it in the moment, it will lose its destructive power. Over time, and with this practice, it becomes a thing of the past.</p><p> Feelings of fraud are very common among even the best leaders, and are actually signs of diligence. So unlike other developmental issues that may linger for an entire career, the fraud misconception is resolved by turning that diligence toward the practices I've described above. The good news is that once you've mastered it, you can keep an eye out for it in others, and help them along too.

This week, we asked our HR professionals and Recruiters to share some of their advice to Jobseekers about how to &ldquo;Job Search like a Recruiter&rdquo;.</p><p> Here were the questions posed and advice given:</p><p> <strong>  Q1- How would you job search like a recruiter? Have you used a Boolean Search? </strong></p><p> Remember we said not all jobs are advertised? Boolean strings help you find postings outside of job boards.  Believe it or not, you already &ndash; in a way &ndash; use Boolean strings when you do a Google search. Just search key words for a job.  The difference in a key word search and a Boolean string is the use of AND, OR and quotes around words to narrow results.</p><p> <strong>  How to start? </strong> <br/> Do some key word searches (i.e &ldquo;Operations AND Management&rdquo;) that will give you all possible jobs then, add AND State.</p><p> Google operators are your friend. Site: In title: Location: <br/> I find &ldquo;+ and &ndash;&ldquo; to be very effective in narrowing down results.</p><p> Combined with commonly used ATS&rsquo;s is useful. Good sites to try are: /Taleo.net  or Brassring.com .</p><p> Even on sites like Indeed.com, you can use these tips to better narrow your results.</p><p> <strong>  Q2- What are the pitfalls of going to the source with a cold call, or email to them? </strong></p><p> There are many opportunities out there. Worst is you receive no response.  If you aren&rsquo;t afraid to pick up the phone, do it and engage about the opportunity.  But, make sure you have planned out how you will present yourself on the phone before you call &ndash; script it out if you have to.  You want to tell them right away 1) who you are and 2) why you are calling&hellip;get right to the point and they may be more inclined to take the time to talk to you.</p><p> Many prefer warm introductions as a way to weed people out. Referrals are the best way to open that conversation with a Recruiter or Hiring Manager.</p><p> If you are cold calling based on a job posting, make sure they don&rsquo;t include &ldquo;no phone calls&rdquo; Cold calling will bite you.  Calling will come off as imposing and infringing on their time. Email is more respectful and cordial.  They may see you as needy not resourceful. Keep it to the point, make your point &amp; move on.</p><p> Often times the jobs are not posted, make a call, the worse is they don&rsquo;t answer, the best you engage for the position.  You have the risk of turning the person off with a cold call, however, you could also create a new opportunity.</p><p> <strong>  BIGGEST TURN OFF according to Recruiters and Hiring Managers: </strong> <br/> Do not leave a cold call message saying:</p><p> &gt;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfect for the job you posted so call me&rdquo; without letting me see your resume first.</p><p> &gt; &ldquo;Hi&hellip;, I saw your opening and was looking to discuss it with you. I fit your qualifications. Give me a call at your convenience.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Bottom line: </strong> Remember &ndash; you are seeking the job so your job is to sell yourself. Have a prepared approach before you start reaching out.</p><p> <strong>  Q3- What do you say on the cold call or email? </strong></p><p> A great way to &ldquo;get their attention&rdquo; on a cold call/email is to find one thing to focus on and how it will benefit them.  Simply state how my previous track record in a similar role and organization would translate to success in their organization.   Keep it under 100 words. In fact, have a script, but don&rsquo;t sound too rehearsed. Needs to be authentic.</p><p> Never mention &ldquo;I have tried to reach you before&rdquo; like you are trying to guilt them into calling you back &ndash; it won&rsquo;t work.  Don&rsquo;t forget that Caller ID tracks missed calls &ndash; so 15 calls in 2 days is NOT advised even if you don&rsquo;t leave a message&hellip;they will know.</p><p> <strong>  Key point:  </strong> Be honest, be real, and engage before asking about a job so you don&rsquo;t come across as being desperate!</p><p> Use phrases like:</p><p> &gt; &ldquo;I would like the opportunity to talk some more on this&rdquo; &ndash; don&rsquo;t go right to wanting the interview.</p><p> &gt; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been following your company. I would like to learn more about *x job* and I&rsquo;d like to meet because&hellip;.&rdquo; &ndash; give a quick sales pitch as to why you would be ideal for their role.</p><p> <strong>  Bottom line: </strong> If you do leave a message, track it and be patient!</p><p> <strong>  Q4- Have you ever skipped over the normal app process and gone straight to the decision maker? What happened? </strong></p><p> General consensus is that most have not skipped over the process.  It&rsquo;s not as easy as you think or always works out better for you.  Some people have even had referrals try to get them further into the process but, depending on &ldquo;how&rdquo; the company wants to handle the hiring process you may get put back into the line with everyone else.</p><p> At times companies will skip the process for someone they want.  Don&rsquo;t take this personally in your job search as it will have less to do with you and your qualifications and more just their choice.</p><p> I would be very careful about skipping over the app process &ndash; not a good way to get yourself an interview.  If it&rsquo;s not a posted job, no problem reaching out to the decision maker but be prepared to get redirected to HR too.</p><p> <strong>  Best advice: </strong> Still apply through the expected application process but you can 1) follow up personally with the Hiring Manager with a sales pitch to be noticed faster or 2) use your networking contacts to try and put in a good word for you to get your resume looked at.</p><p> <strong>  Q5- What do you really think about the hiring process? </strong> <br/> <br/> The hiring process is not set in stone.  Depending on the company, each process can be unique. Some may make a decision after one interview, while others may take five.  Doesn&rsquo;t always mean that the company doesn&rsquo;t know what they are doing &ndash; depending on the level of position, there may be more decision makers involved.  Because there is no set hiring process that all companies use&hellip;you have to be flexible to their terms.</p><p> Some rely on invalid techniques: i.e. &ldquo;Why is a manhole cover round?&rdquo; Interviewers &ldquo;think&rdquo; using off the wall questions will help narrow there candidate pool, but in the end it won&rsquo;t uncover your next star programmer&hellip;as Google found out.</p><p> Keep in mind &ndash; even those interviewing you may not know &ldquo;how&rdquo; to do it. It&rsquo;s not a skill that is formally taught.  Even when many HR professionals and Recruiters are the Interviewee, we have just as much frustration with the person conducting the interview&hellip;and are tempted to stop the interview to &ldquo;school&rdquo; them on the process.</p><p> Yes, sadly, there are still companies and Recruiters that don&rsquo;t follow up with candidates after interviews to communicate decisions or where they are in the process so its frustrating to jobseekers.</p><p> <strong>  In the end: </strong> Just because the hiring process may seem flawed &ndash; don&rsquo;t think the company or the job will be. Try to stick it out and see.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-11 20:17:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-11 20:17:52.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_11FXf93.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-job-search-like-a-recruiter/\", \"post_id\": \"5369\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-11 20:17:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-11 20:17:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-job-search-like-a-recruiter\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5368\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2429\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439158771502-46975f6e44e9-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"535\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439406900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2378,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The 2 Reasons Your Marketing Isn't Working","link":"the-2-reasons-your-marketing-isnt-working","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In business, often the reasons for success and failure can be considered very complex. But when you break down marketing successes and failures, there are really just two reasons why a service-based business is not having desired success.</p><p> <strong>  1) You have the wrong strategy; or  </strong></p><p> <strong>  2) You have the wrong people implementing the strategy. </strong></p><p> More often than not, we are trying to fix the wrong problem.</p><p> It seems pretty obvious, but many firms can begin to solve their marketing issues by first determining which reason is causing the issue and then fixing the right problem. For instance, if you do a lot of public seminars but are not seeing corresponding sales results, you may want to just stop doing them. I received a call from a financial advisor early last month with a &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; issue about the public workshops he was hosting. He had people attending his workshop, he received high evaluations on the seminar presentation, and 75% said they would like more information or a meeting. However, very few every turned into an appointment or a sale. He was convinced that the wrong people were attending the seminar for the topic he was presenting on. Crazy enough, after talking with his staff, the reason was right in front of him. His two staff people responsible for scheduling appointments after a workshop were swamped with their day-to-day work and didn&rsquo;t begin calling to schedule appointments until almost one week after the event. By that time there is no doubt that the interest had waned. Conclusion: People problem.</p><p> In another case, an advisor was sending out a regular email newsletter. It went out like clockwork executed by his staff. The content was well written and provided to him through a reputable service he subscribed to. But he felt like nothing was happening since he started sending out the email newsletter six months earlier &ndash; no comments, calls, appointments, etc. After he took a hard look at the analytics on who was opening his email newsletter, however, it became clear that very few people were even opening his newsletter called &ldquo;Retirement Talk.&rdquo; Maybe because a majority of his email list was comprised of business owners and executives. It was determined that this target group was not seeing themselves in retirement yet and so they weren&rsquo;t even opening his email. He then selected a different email newsletter from his provider that he called &ldquo;Financial Smarts&hellip; for Entrepreneurs and Professionals&rdquo; and his open rate doubled and continues to go up. Conclusions: Strategy problem.</p><p> You may be thinking that these issues are so simple and obvious. And they are. Almost rudimentary. But they happen ALL THE TIME! So, try thinking about marketing in a less complex way as the answer is often right there in front of you.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-11 20:10:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-11 20:10:59.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_YZgUq0o.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-2-reasons-your-marketing-isnt-working/\", \"post_id\": \"5367\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-11 20:10:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-11 20:10:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-2-reasons-your-marketing-isnt-working\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5366\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2428\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SplitShire-0129-1800x1200-970x500.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"383\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439402400,"author_id":322,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2377,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Client Surveys – 6 Ways You Can Go From Good to Great","link":"client-surveys-6-ways-you-can-go-from-good-to-great","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Client surveys are a critical component of your overall business plan and should be incorporated into your marketing plan as well. Your surveys measure satisfaction or dissatisfaction with services you offer your clients.</p><p> Client surveys should be designed to determine your clients&rsquo; vital needs as well as building and deepening your personal relationships. The results of your survey can aide your firm in building invaluable loyalty and prompt existing clients to provide qualified referrals.</p><p> Firms that incorporate client surveys within their overall business and marketing plan position themselves ahead of their competitors. However, it doesn&rsquo;t stop there &ndash; you must be prepared to process the information you receive from your surveys and take action in order to have an impact on your overall strategy and incorporate excitement among your clients.</p><h3> Benefits of Client Surveys <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Client Retention: </strong>  A well planned client survey allows your firm to gather client feedback which can greatly improve client retention rates.</li><li> <strong>  Performance Opinions: </strong>   Clients are your best judge of your products, services, and performance.  Utilize your client survey to determine where areas of improvement are needed.</li><li> <strong>  New Trends/Innovative Ideas: </strong>  Gain knowledge through your client survey by taking advantage of suggestions to improve products or introduce a new one. <br/>  </li><h3> 6 Must Dos With a Client Survey</h3><p> <br/> 1)   <strong>  Increase Your Bottom Line: </strong>  The sale doesn&rsquo;t stop when your client signs the paperwork. Unfortunately, many firms don&rsquo;t have a solid client communication process in place. Part of your system should include a survey once a prospect becomes a client. Demonstrate the importance of your survey to your clients by communicating how the survey enables you to better serve them. Incorporate surveys into your new client process to aide in your client retention strategy.</p><p> 2) <strong>   Replicate the Process: </strong>  Create the stage and allow your clients to tell a story. A survey with number rankings will not produce the information you need to toot your horn or make changes. When clients can illustrate what you and your team did well, you will want to replicate the process to be certain it becomes routine.</p><p> 3)   <strong>  Develop Meaningful Questions: </strong>  Craft your survey to encourage open-ended feedback by incorporating open-ended questions. Yes and no answers will not provide you with the comprehensive information you need or desire. Dig diligently to find the questions you want answered and integrate ways for clients to refer to specific examples.</p><p> 4) <strong>   Be Ready For Change: </strong>  Avoid taking the time and effort of creating and distributing client surveys without the intention of making changes or improvements. Assimilate surveys into your marketing plan to leverage opportunities to stand ahead of your competition. If clients are asking for more information regarding certain topics or say they never read your newsletter, be certain to take the suggestions to heart. Assign someone in your office or a team of people dedicated to collaborate and brainstorm for ways to implement survey responses. Announce changes through email blasts, social media, and newsletters. This will create excitement among your clients, especially the ones that made the suggestion.</p><p> 5)   <strong>  Test Different Survey Methods: </strong>  Most clients will complete a survey as long as they know it is confidential; they don&rsquo;t want you to know who is making comments. Avoid putting your clients in an awkward position by offering different survey methods that are easily accessible. Some options include using a third party, email surveys, website feedback, or a free survey site such as  <a href=\"http://www.surveymonkey.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SurveyMonkey </a> . Many firms have reported significantly better results through a simple phone conversation with clients. Test the water to find what fits best for your clients and provides you with valuable information.</p><p> 6) <strong>   WOW Your Client: </strong>  If you use a survey method where you can identify the client, create added value by sending a handwritten thank you note or calling them to say thanks. How many times have you been thanked for completing a survey? Thanking your clients will show you genuinely care about their input and build stronger relationships. This will earn you a WOW factor!</p><h3> In Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> Consider client surveys an empowering and enlightening tool essential to your business and marketing plan and incorporate comments into your strategic SWOT analysis. Keep surveys brief, if they are too long, no one will return them.</p><p> In addition to offering your survey at the beginning of your relationship with a new client, implement a recurring survey strategy to capitalize on new market trends and opportunities. You may want to take a leap and survey prospects as well. A well-managed survey process will reveal a client-focused culture.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-11 20:06:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-11 20:06:18.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_hSaXRTm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/client-surveys-6-ways-you-can-go-from-good-to-great/\", \"post_id\": \"5365\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-11 20:06:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-11 20:06:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"client-surveys-6-ways-you-can-go-from-good-to-great\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5364\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2427\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SplitShire-1318-1800x507-970x500.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"476\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439379900,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}

Suddenly this minor dilemma gets harder to deal with.</p><p> In my first book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Clients-Life-Expert-Hire-Extraordinary/dp/0684870304/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=8-1&amp;qid=1398779245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Clients for Life  </a> </u> , I wrote about the attribute of &ldquo;selfless independence.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a hallmark of great client advisors. You are totally devoted to your client, but at the same time, exercise complete objectivity and are willing to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; at critical junctures. Even if it costs you money.</p><p> Most people say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that. I am able to say no.&rdquo; But here&rsquo;s the point: When it&rsquo;s easy and straightforward, it&rsquo;s easy! But when it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s hard.</p><p> For example&mdash;how would you deal with these situations:</p><h3> A client wants to take a course of action that you believe is truly wrong for them.</h3><p> <br/> Again, I&rsquo;m guessing you would comfortably argue your position with them and try and talk them out of it.</p><p> But how about if the course of action the client wants to take&mdash;say they want to acquire another company, and you really think it&rsquo;s a lousy idea&mdash;will result in a large amount of new work for you and lots of fees.</p><p> Hmmm&hellip;do you think there&rsquo;s a chance that prospect might affect your behavior? Maybe you&rsquo;d argue less strenuously for them to not do it?</p><p> How about this one&mdash;which frankly, is pretty common. You work for a large company and you manage one of its largest client accounts. You firmly believe that you are serving all of the client&rsquo;s needs, and that there really aren&rsquo;t any other products or services you should be trying to sell to them. But your CEO and leadership team are pressuring you to grow the account even further. They disagree with you and feel you could double the revenue!</p><p> Sound far fetched? One of the books about the collapse of Arthur Andersen&mdash;which by the way was a very complicated and tragic event&mdash;said that the Enron account accounted for $50 million a year  in revenue to Arthur Anderson, their auditors. And that during their client account planning process the corporate office suggested it could be a $100 million account. And that should be their goal&mdash;to grow it from $50 million to $100 million! There was huge pressure on the Enron team to expand that relationship even further, even though, under the best scenarios, it was a huge exposure for them!</p><p> And finally, here&rsquo;s another classic situation. Your senior client asks you to make changes in your final report so that their board of directors will not get alarmed and think that the company&rsquo;s problems are serious. How would you respond?</p><p> Well, you might say&hellip;it depends. Are they asking you to truly muzzle your conclusions? Or just frame them a little differently? And where do you draw the line?</p><p> My point is that some cases are easy to deal with and they are black and white, open and shut cases. But others are more complicated and, frankly, present a more slippery slope because of the way they tug at your competing interests.</p><p> Build your reputation for this powerful quality of selfless independence. It may drive a few clients away, but it will attract many, many others.</p><p> What dilemmas have you found yourself in with clients?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-11 19:51:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-11 19:51:33.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_jbgchBi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-truly-independent-from-your-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"5363\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-11 19:51:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-11 19:51:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-truly-independent-from-your-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5362\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2426\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-6.08.45-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"455\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439379000,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2375,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Empowering Women in the Workplace: Help Yourself","link":"empowering-women-in-the-workplace-help-yourself","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Many of my seminars and coaching sessions over the past 25 years have focused on empowering women &ndash; especially helping them to gain an awareness of how they present themselves to others. This requires women to understand the ways in which they communicate, both verbally and nonverbally.Listed below are my top 10 suggestions to help women be professional, get their voices heard, and enhance their credibility. <strong>  1. Speak loudly enough to be heard. </strong>  If I could say just one thing to women, it would be: &ldquo;Speak up!&rdquo;  Women often speak too softly, and make it easy for others to tune them out. Practice increasing your volume. Initially, you may feel that you are shouting, but the chances are that you are finally speaking loudly enough to be heard. <strong>  2. Learn to interrupt. </strong>  Interrupting can be an annoying speaking habit, but sometimes it&rsquo;s vital for women to put aside the niceties to create an opportunity to speak. In some situations, if you don&rsquo;t interrupt, you won&rsquo;t get to speak. When interrupting, you can say, &ldquo;To build on what you are saying&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;We also need to discuss&hellip;.&rdquo; <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t ask permission to speak. </strong>  Women often ask, &ldquo;May I say something?&rdquo; Others raise a hand to &ldquo;request&rdquo; permission to speak.   Instead, say something like, &ldquo;The question remaining is&hellip;,&rdquo; or just start talking to add your point. <strong>  4. Dress professionally, not seductively. </strong> In a professional situation, you don&rsquo;t want to wear clothing that&rsquo;s too low, too short, too sexy, or too anything. Think about the message you are sending when you wear short skirts. You&rsquo;re not saying, &ldquo;Look at me because I know what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re saying, &ldquo;Look at me because I have great legs.&rdquo; <strong>  5. Command the room.  </strong> Walk into the room as though you belong there. Go up to people. Shake hands correctly. Stand assertively &ndash; no slouching &ndash; and don&rsquo;t cross your ankles while standing. (An amazing number of women still do this.) Look people in the eye. Don&rsquo;t wring your hands or play with your hair. Take a seat at the table. Do not sit on one of those chairs that are often arranged against the wall. You want to be part of the discussion, not an observer. Additional information on professional presence can be found in my book  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071811265/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0071811265&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pachasso-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Essentials of Business Etiquette  </u>  .  </a> <strong>  6. Eliminate self-discounting statements. </strong>  Don&rsquo;t start your comments with, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only my opinion,&rdquo; or similar statements. Don&rsquo;t conclude with, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What do you think?&rdquo; If you discount yourself, it&rsquo;s easy for others to discount you as well. <strong>  7. Use direct statements instead of questions. </strong> When you use a question instead of a statement, you are giving the person you&rsquo;re talking with the opportunity to say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Instead of giving away your power by asking, &ldquo;Can I add something?&rdquo; say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to add to that.&rdquo; Instead of asking, &ldquo;Could you clarify that statement?&rdquo; say, &ldquo;I need additional information.&rdquo; <strong>  8. Be cautious about using the words &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </strong>  Women have a tendency to apologize too much, or to use the words inappropriately. When you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you may be undermining your own standing (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to bother you...&rdquo;), or taking responsibility for something that is not your fault.  (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry the project is behind schedule.&rdquo;) <strong>  9. Stop complaining and learn to confront. </strong>  Complainers don&rsquo;t confront, but gripe to others about their situations. Unfortunately, lots of women complain. You can learn to speak up and ask for what you want in a 'polite and powerful' manner. Additional information on confronting can be found in my book  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/073821759X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=073821759X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pachasso-20&amp;linkId=SX262DDEVQPRT6WJ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Power of Positive Confrontation  </u>  .  </a> <strong>  10. Be visible. </strong>  Get involved. Join organizations and volunteer for their committees. Participate in office activities. Volunteer to make presentations. Develop yourself--take additional training, get certified or obtain a degree. Use social media to comment positively on your company. Enter competitions and apply for awards.Start paying attention to how you present yourself. What items do you need to work on? There are many more items that could be added to this list, but these 10 are a good start.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-11 19:45:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-11 19:45:41.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_W5QYEue.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/empowering-women-in-the-workplace-help-yourself/\", \"post_id\": \"5361\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-11 19:45:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-11 19:45:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"empowering-women-in-the-workplace-help-yourself\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5360\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2425\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-10.26.55-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"580\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439398800,"author_id":51,"chart_url":""}

According to recent studies, that day is finally here.While user interest research has been indicating that support for the cloud is increasing, reports now show hard numbers indicating that organizations are putting their money where their mouths are: They&rsquo;re spending more in operational expense, and less in capital expense, reports Computer Economics in its report  <u>  <a href=\"http://docs.media.bitpipe.com/io_10x/io_102267/item_465972/CEB%20IT%20Budget%20Benchmark%202015-16_MFV.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015/2016 IT Spending &amp; Staffing Benchmarks  </a> </u> .&ldquo;We are starting to see the effects of a transition to the cloud,&rdquo; the report states. &ldquo;We expect the transition to accelerate operational spending while depressing capital spending. This seems to be happening. We also anticipate that cloud computing will deliver real value to enterprises in lower cost of IT and higher service levels. The data is indicating that the cost of IT is declining on a per-user basis and as a percentage of revenue.&rdquo;For example, Computer Economics&rsquo; findings show that 56 percent of IT organizations are currently increasing spending on cloud applications, compared with only 10 percent that are increasing spending on data center infrastructure.Interestingly, IT spending as a percentage of revenue has dropped since last year from 2.5 percent to 2.3 percent. This could mean that IT spending will rise in the near future. &ldquo;Another possibility is that the transition to cloud technology is beginning to pay dividends and IT is becoming more efficient,&rdquo; Computer Economics writes optimistically.In the specific case of  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/state-cios-juggle-cobol-cloud-and-drones/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   government  </a> </u> , the federal government led the way in 2010 by declaring a &ldquo;cloud first&rdquo; policy, writes Forbes in its report,  <u>  <a href=\"http://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/Microsoft_Govt_Cloud-REPORT.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   From Promise to Reality: How Local, State and Federal Government Agencies Achieve Results in the Cloud  </a> </u> . For example, enterprise software firm Deltek&rsquo;s Federal Industry Analysis predicts a 21 percent compound annual growth rate in federal spending on cloud, reaching $6.5 billion by 2019, according to the report. In addition, public sector cloud is predicted to account for more than half of global software, server and storage spending growth by 2018, the report cites IDC as saying.In addition, this emphasis on the cloud has trickled down to  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/state-cios-turning-cloud-save-money-amid-security-fears/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   state and local governments  </a> </u>  as well, Forbes writes. &ldquo;What began as a national policy initiative is now cascading, not merely at the federal level but also into the practices of numerous state and local jurisdictions,&rdquo; states the report. &ldquo;Indeed, a growing number of state CIOs have implemented cloud-first policies of their own.&rdquo;In particular, areas such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/mobile-access-documents-helps-boost-gang-arrests/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   law enforcement  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/using-workflow-managing-cases-all-types/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   case management  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/3-questions-todd-sander-future-digital-government/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   e-government  </a> </u>  are well-suited for the cloud, Forbes writes. <u>  <a href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/article/2944472/cloud-computing/nearly-one-third-of-all-it-infrastructure-spending-now-devoted-to-cloud.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sales figures are backing this up  </a> </u> , according to a recent IDC study. &ldquo;Just before the Independence Day holiday, research firm IDC released its assessment of the  <u>  Worldwide Cloud IT Infrastructure Market </u> &mdash;and the numbers were astonishing,&rdquo; writes Fredric Paul in Network World.</p><li> Server, storage, and Ethernet switch revenue for public and private cloud systems grew by 25.1 percent year over year to nearly $6.3 billion in the first quarter of 2015</li><li> The percentage of total IT infrastructure spending devoted to the cloud grew to nearly 30 percent, up from 26.4 percent a year ago.</li><li> Private cloud revenue jumped 24.4 percent to $2.4 billion</li><li> Public cloud grew even faster, up 25.5 percent to $3.9 billion</li><li> Servers led the way, up 28 percent for the private cloud and 33 percent for the public cloud</li>In comparison, non-cloud IT infrastructure increased by only 6.1 percent, primarily due to server sales, Paul writes. &ldquo;Non-cloud Ethernet switch sales ticked up just 1 percent, while storage sales actually declined.&rdquo;<u> <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/cloud-it-infrastructure-spending-to-reach-33-4-billion-in-2015-idc/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Altogether </a></u>, cloud spending now accounts for a third of all IT infrastructure spending.In addition, <u> <a href=\"http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/07/06/public-cloud-data-center-expansion-fuels-it-spending-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  IDC predictions </a></u> for the IT infrastructure market show a steady decline in traditional IT through 2019, the end of the study period, with <u> commensurate increases in public and private cloud</u> instead.That&rsquo;s not to say, of course, that the traditional datacenter is going away. &ldquo;It will take a long time before cloud becomes the dominant architecture in terms of revenues,&rdquo; writes Timothy Prickett Morgan in The Platform, of the IDC results.&ldquo;At the end of the forecast period [2019], public cloud spending on this gear will crest to $35.3 billion and private cloud spending will hit $19.2 billion, and together they will account for 46.5 percent of overall core infrastructure spending.&rdquo;So if your mom was always telling you to get your head out of the clouds?

{"original_id":2373,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Stop Trying to Do More and More","link":"stop-trying-to-do-more-and-more","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In Theodore Levitt&rsquo;s  The Marketing Imagination , the renowned marketing professor said there was no such thing as a commodity, only people who think like commodities. Differentiation is still the name of the marketing game. Distinction in service, image and promise allows a brand to occupy a piece of a customer&rsquo;s busy mind. More importantly, differentiation is the brand&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre, its reason for being that causes customers to think of it when they are ready to shop. And when they do shop, this is the brand that goes into real and virtual shopping carts.</p><h3> Do Less, Better</h3><p> <br/> Today, differentiation is under siege. Increasing customer and shareholder demands and the influx of new lower-cost competitors have CMOs caught in a &lsquo;do more and more&rsquo; strategic paradigm. At a time when they should &lsquo;do less, better,&rsquo; they are frantically adding more products, line extending brands, and adding endless features to products and services. The result is complexity. Complexity stifles organizations and confuses consumers.  </p><p> Several big brand marketers have fallen on their own swords in their effort to drive growth. I have been a big fan of  Kellogg&rsquo;s  since I was an account executive at the Leo Burnett Advertising Agency. The name stood for healthy breakfasts, and for decades adept marketers worked hard to fortify that stellar reputation. This good work established  Kellogg&rsquo;s Special K  as a healthy, nutritious breakfast for diet-conscious women.</p><h3> Differentiation Requires Sacrifice</h3><p> <br/> But, with a stagnating top and bottom line,  Kellogg  decided to spread their corporate wings. It is one thing to diversify, as per their acquisitions of  Keebler  and  Pringles , but quite another to exploit a valuable brand asset by slapping &lsquo;K&rsquo; on products that fail to build or live up to  Kellogg&rsquo;s Special K&rsquo;s  core positioning. This is the opposite of sacrifice&mdash;this is sacrilege.</p><p> I see the rationale for nutritious granola and cereal bars, but the launches of cracker chips and flatbread breakfast sandwiches under  Special K  goes too far.  Special K  Cracker Chips contain 110 calories per 30 gram serving. This is marginally less than  Frito Lay&rsquo;s  127 calories for the same weight. Flatbread sandwiches may be 40% less calories than  McDonald&rsquo;s  version, but they are still a combo of cholesterol, fat, and sodium that won&rsquo;t do you any good.</p><h3> The Drums of KISS Continue to Beat</h3><p> <br/> If you want differentiation, you have to ask yourself this question: What am I prepared to sacrifice to get it? Differentiation in marketing requires giving up a benefit or two or three to make one compelling promise. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the relationship you have with your customers has to be boring. There are endless ways to engage without giving up on your brand&rsquo;s core positioning. The drums of the long-serving KISS concept continue to beat in this complex business world. Those who embrace the notion of &lsquo;keep it simple&rsquo; and &lsquo;do less, better&rsquo; come out on top. Promising service is easy. Airlines, telecoms, and credit card companies promise customer satisfaction all the time; do they deliver it?</p><p> In the high tech and information age sectors, consumer and customer insight is the precursor to product and service differentiation. Successful companies don&rsquo;t stumble upon insight. Inquisitive marketers burrow for it and conceptualize it. Then they act upon it.

{"original_id":2372,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Dramatic Benefits of Real Time Personalization: Using Personalized Content to Further the Sale","link":"the-dramatic-benefits-of-real-time-personalization-using-personalized-content-to-further-the-sale","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> There are more than 6 billion people in the world, and each of them has their own interests, regional differences, and buying patterns.</p><p> No matter how great your content writers are, and how good your sales pitch is, it is simply impossible to make the same content apply to every person throughout your entire potential audience.</p><p> <strong>  Real time personalization </strong>  is a strategy by which you can automatically modify your content to fit the needs of different audience members, ensuring that their interests and consumer data are reflected in the content that you serve them. Done correctly, real time personalization ensures that you are always serving relevant and timely content to your website visitors, and it can make your website visitors feel like your entire website experience has been crafted specifically for them.</p><h3> Getting Started With Real Time Personalization</h3><p> <br/> In order to personalize your content for your viewers, you first need to collect data on them. There is a fine line between egregious privacy violation and acceptable business use of data collection, but almost every business in the world uses some form of cookie or lead-capture form to collect a minimum of data about their website viewers.</p><p> In a perfect world, you would be able to correlate identities to each website viewer &ndash; using previous form fills, but you can get started with something as simple as a region or country identification through geo-location of their IP address.</p><h3> Localization and Internationalization</h3><p> <br/> If your company does business internationally, personalization can start with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/website-localization-enterprise-website/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   localization and internationalization  </a> </u> . There are numerous applications, including free ones that are provided by Google and other software developers that will automatically translate your content for visitors in different countries.</p><p> These programs basically recognize which country a viewer is coming from, directing them to a subdomain that is specifically built for their country &ndash; with content in their language and with localization changes (like the natural language translation, or use of case studies or photography that makes more sense for that region) that create a personalized experience for those countries.</p><h3> Using Tokens and Snippets to Personalize Content</h3><p> <br/> If you have a marketing automation system or CRM system that allows you to track information about your web visitors, you can also use that system to personalize your content &ndash; inserting data from the CRM system into the site when visitors stop on certain pages,  <strong>  or customizing the information altogether </strong>  based on your visitor.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve ever received an email from a company that uses your first name in the subject line, you&rsquo;ve already seen how simple dynamic content can work &ndash; taking generic content and tailoring it for an individual through an automated process.</p><p> While this all occurs in the background of your site, it still makes it look as though your content is being tailored uniquely for each of your visitors &ndash; and it can increase your conversion rates by catching a visitor&rsquo;s eye and creating the relevance that your brand needs to further the sale.</p><h3> Segmented Content</h3><p> <br/> The ultimate goal of real time personalization is to actually change the content itself for different visitors to your site &ndash; using context clues and saved lead data to manage your content and serve different items to different market segments.</p><p> <strong>  This can be done through   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/marketing-automation-website-lead-generation-engine/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    commercial marketing automation systems   </a>  </u>   like HubSpot </strong>  &ndash; and it relies on information that you have already gleaned about a lead through a combination of database queries and lead generation forms.</p><p> For example, say you know that one of your website visitors works for a restaurant, since he previously filled out a form that asked for his company name and industry &ndash; or you have a reasonable suspicion that he works for a restaurant since the other pages that he visited on your site are all restaurant related.</p><p> If this is the case, you could set up your website CRM or marketing platform to offer up dynamic content that is specific to your restaurant market segment. For example, you can set your homepage banner to display pictures of your product in use in a restaurant environment, and you can feature case studies that are restaurant-specific.</p><p> Real time personalization allows your company to tailor your website content specifically for your leads, furthering the sale and increasing the chance that the prospect will take a sales-related action.</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-11 19:19:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-11 19:19:17.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_LEFidNO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-dramatic-benefits-of-real-time-personalization-using-personalized-content-to-further-the-sale/\", \"post_id\": \"5355\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-11 19:19:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-11 19:19:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-dramatic-benefits-of-real-time-personalization-using-personalized-content-to-further-the-sale\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5354\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2422\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SplitShire-4443-1800x1200-970x500.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"328\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439395200,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}

Content</h3><p> <br/> Once you have your plan, you&rsquo;ll need to create compelling content for your campaigns. You don&rsquo;t want to simply parrot the same exact content across every channel. Instead, you&rsquo;ll use careful analysis to drive message creation. Think: right message, right time. As UK digital marketing agency Blue Glass points out, &ldquo;The goal should be to create the best piece of content on a given subject and to promote it to a targeted and relevant audience.&rdquo;</p><p> So the question becomes: What makes the best multi-channel marketing content? Your content should:</p><li> Tie into business goals and SEO without appearing like an obvious sales pitch.</li><li> Tell your brand story to a specific audience without being too long or too short.</li><li> Influence sales by answering important buying decision questions.</li><li> Appeals with insightful, creative, funny and helpful information.</li><li> Build online authority and brand reputation with quotes, facts and links.</li><li> Expand your audience by not only appealing to current customers, but creating awareness for prospects too.</li><p> <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cross-Channel-Success-725x600.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Cross-Channel-Success\" src=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cross-Channel-Success-725x600.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Image Courtesy of:  <u>  <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/report-89-of-marketers-have-problems-with-cross-channel-marketing-data-linkage-is-the-biggest-culprit-131007\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketingland.com  </a> </u></p><p> You might like:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-b2b-content-marketing-failing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8 Reasons Your B2B Content Marketing is Failing  </a> </u></p><h3> 4.

A recent Bloomberg article points out that the gold rout has cost China and Russia $5.4 billion, an amount that would sound colossal were it not for the fact that U.S. media companies such as Disney and Viacom collectively lost over $60 billion for shareholders in as little as two days last week.</p><p> Below are the weekly losses for just a handful of those companies. Compared to many other asset classes, gold has held up well, even after factoring in its price decline.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-07/COMM-Media-Stocks-Collapse-Gold-Holds-Its-Own-08072015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Media Stocks Collapse, Gold Holds Its Own\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-07/COMM-Media-Stocks-Collapse-Gold-Holds-Its-Own-08072015.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> And isn&rsquo;t it funny that the Federal Reserve doesn&rsquo;t keep other countries&rsquo; currencies, but it continues to hold gold&mdash;and in larger amounts than any other central bank? China and Russia have two of the biggest gold reserves in the world&mdash;and have added to them recently&mdash;but they don&rsquo;t come close to the Fed&rsquo;s holdings, even when combined. What&rsquo;s more, the U.S. Treasury&rsquo;s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency just classified gold as money by placing gold futures in the foreign exchange derivatives classification.</p><img alt=\"Countries with largest gold holdings\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-07/COMM-Countries-with-largest-gold-holdings-08072015.png\"/><p> Indeed, central banks all over the world continue to add to their gold reserves. If the metal were as valueless as a pet rock, as one Wall Street Journal op-ed recently claimed, why would they bother to do this? A few weeks ago,  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/3-reasons-why-gold-isnt-behaving-like-gold-right-now/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  China disclosed the amount of gold </a>  its central bank holds for the first time in six years. Global markets reacted negatively that the country increased its reserves &ldquo;only&rdquo; 57 percent. But the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Global_Economic_Outlook_3Q15_Cap3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Gold Council  </a> </u>  (WGC) saw this as positive news:</p><p> We believe the People&rsquo;s Bank of China&rsquo;s confirmation of its revised gold holdings is supportive for the gold market. It reiterates how China, along with other central banks, views gold as a key resource asset as it continues to seek diversification away from the U.S. dollar.</p><p> As I&rsquo;ve said before, China is the 800-pound commodities gorilla. This has largely been the case since 2000.</p><h3> Half a Trillion Dollars a Year in Commodities</h3><p> <br/> Between 2002 and 2012, China was growing fast at an average annual pace of around 10 percent. The country was responsible for nearly all of the net increase in global metals consumption between 2000 and 2014, according to the World Bank. Over the same time period, its share of metals consumption tripled, eventually reaching an astounding 47 percent.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-07/COMM-Chinas-share-of-metal-consumption-reached-47-percent-in-2014-08072015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"China's Share of Metal Consumption Reached 47 Percent in 2014\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-07/COMM-Chinas-share-of-metal-consumption-reached-47-percent-in-2014-08072015.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> The year 2014 was a standout for Chinese commodity imports. Compelled by low prices, the country, which accounted for 12 percent of worldwide imports, brought in record volumes of crude oil, iron ore, copper and other raw materials.</p><p> Because China is a trading partner with practically every other country, and because it imports over $500 billion a year in commodities, its importance in global trade cannot be stressed enough.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Global_Economic_Outlook_3Q15_Cap3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BBVA Research  </a> </u>  writes that &ldquo;any reduction in its level of [purchasing] activity places significant downward pressure on the prices of [commodities], such as oil or copper.&rdquo;</p><p> And yet we&rsquo;re seeing that reduction now. For the past five months, China&rsquo;s purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI) has remained below the neutral 50 mark, indicating that its manufacturing sector has been in contraction mode for the better part of this year so far.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-07/COMM-Chinas-manufacturing-pmi-falls-to-two-year-low-in-july-08072015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"China's Manufacturing PMI Falls to a Two-Year Low in July\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-07/COMM-Chinas-manufacturing-pmi-falls-to-two-year-low-in-july-08072015.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that China is still the number one importer of many key materials, including coal, iron ore and crude oil. The country&rsquo;s import growth of these commodities continues to rise, but at a slower pace than in years past.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t necessarily the case with gold, however.</p><h3> Demand Still Higher Than the Five-Year Average</h3><p> <br/> According to the WGC, the decline in Chinese gold demand has been overstated.</p><p> Although China&rsquo;s jewelry demand in the first quarter of 2015 was down from the record level the previous year, it was 27 percent higher than its five-year average. And consumer demand&mdash;jewelry plus bar and coins&mdash;in the first quarter was the fourth best on record, surpassed only by the surge in demand triggered by the price fall in 2013.</p><p> The WGC also points out that gold has a low correlation with and different demand drivers than commodities. Whereas commodities, as expressed by the Bloomberg Commodities Index, have returned to 2001 levels, gold is still up significantly for the period shown in the chart below.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-07/COMM-gold-has-outperformed-the-commodities-complex-08072015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Gold has Outperformed the Commodities Complex\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-07/COMM-gold-has-outperformed-the-commodities-complex-08072015.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> As many of you know, I call gold&rsquo;s drivers the Fear Trade and the Love Trade. I recently had the pleasure to describe these drivers to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/in-the-news/gold-and-the-global-economy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mike Gleason of Money Metals Exchange.  </a> </u></p><p> The Fear Trade, dominant in the psyche of North America, involves money supply growth and real interest rates. Whenever the U.S. has negative real interest rates, gold starts to rise in dollar terms, and whenever we have positive real rates of return, it starts to decline. If you go back to 2011, we had negative real interest rates off 3 percent on a 10-year government bond, and the average gold price that year was around $1,500 per ounce. But now that rates are positive 2 percent, the metal&rsquo;s been depressed.</p><p> The Love Trade includes the purchase of the precious metal due to cultural affinity and rising GDP per capita in Asia and the Middle East. This includes gift giving of bullion and gold jewelry in anticipation of upcoming festivals such as Diwali, Christmas and the Chinese New Year. Historically, the Love Trade has begun to pick up around this time of the year.</p><p> Gold is a long-term investment with long-standing tradition. This remains true even now that prices have declined. As always, I recommend a 10 percent weighting: 5 percent in gold stocks, 5 percent in bullion or jewelry, then rebalance every year.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-11 16:36:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-11 16:36:21.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_mBe5N8I.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/gold-holds-its-own-against-these-media-darlings/\", \"post_id\": \"5351\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-11 16:36:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-11 16:36:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"gold-holds-its-own-against-these-media-darlings\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5350\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2420\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-9.44.20-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"837\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439391600,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

Surely this latter bunch must question my sanity for even considering a topic open to debate.On this rare occasion (alright, for first time ever) I will withhold my opinion. Rather, I&rsquo;ll offer some (predominantly) economic realities to help you draw your own conclusion. Why?Worth is the value someone places on a thing, idea, or whatever. It&rsquo;s perceived more than absolute. This makes determining the value of someone&rsquo;s college degree as tricky as evaluating the price tags of the abstract art that adorns the walls of my home.</p><h3> Since I&rsquo;m in the perception business, I&rsquo;ll give it go.</h3>First, I enjoyed my years attending a large university. I spent many grueling hours studying (most in a campus bar) to attain a (now very rusty) Bachelors of Science Degree in Electric Engineering (for a life I never pursued).I have fond memories and friendships that I still nurture thirty years later even though the only recollection I have of Ohm&rsquo;s Law is that it resembles a horseshoe.I wouldn&rsquo;t trade those years away for anything because, well, I don&rsquo;t believe in trading away or regretting time you&rsquo;ve already spent. What&rsquo;s done is done.Before you (or more likely your child) pursue that precious piece of paper, consider this. You can perceive it however you&rsquo;d like&hellip;Statistically, data suggests that the education-wage gap has grown over time. In recent years, individuals twenty-five to thirty-two years old with a college degree earned an average of $17,500 more annually than their peers with solely a high school diploma. In 1979, this gap was $9,690 (<u> <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Rising Costs of Not Going to College 2014 </a></u>).Over the course of their careers, bachelor degree holders earn an average of approximately one million dollars more than high school diploma holders. This is all nonsense for so many reasons including no one has any clue what will happen over the course of an individual&rsquo;s life. Let&rsquo;s have some fun anyway. There are a number of ways to look at this. One can argue that you could take the $250,000 it would cost to attend a premier college and invest it today (assuming you don&rsquo;t have to borrow it). Over a forty-five year career, that investment would grow to $945,000 if you achieved a mere 3% annual return and $2,246,252 (yowza!) if you scratched out a 5% annual return. Those are not unrealistic investment scenarios considering that modest rate of return. Of course, this one-million-dollar differential doesn&rsquo;t account for any compensation one can earn during the four years not attending college. Of course, you can go to a much lower cost college. The <u> <a href=\"https://www.collegedata.com/en/pay-your-way/college-sticker-shock/how-much-does-college-cost/whats-the-price-tag-for-a-college-education/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  College Board </a></u> indicates that the &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; college budget for an in-state public college for 2014-2105 costs $23,410. (If you took the four-year grand total of $93,640 and invested it over the life of an average career at 5% annual return that yields $841,000.) None of these scenarios include any debt repayment that depletes your one-million-dollar &ldquo;college bonus&rdquo; as you faithfully repay your student loan and its ridiculous annual interest of 5-8%.The United States currently has forty-three self-made billionaires. Ten of them do not hold college degrees. You can view the list <u> <a href=\"http://factually.gizmodo.com/one-in-four-self-made-american-billionaires-dropped-out-1656784411\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a></u>. Thirty-two percent of theworld&rsquo;s top one hundred billionaires didn&rsquo;t earn college degrees. You can Google this topic. There are dozens of articles related to this.Trying to keep pace with the rising cost of college is futile. According to <u> <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/average-rates-growth-published-charges-decade\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  College Board </a></u>, during the thirty-year span between 1984-2014, the average published tuitionof private four-year institutions rose a whopping 146% when adjusted for inflation. The increase for in-state students at public institutions during that same period rose a staggering 225%. In 1984, according to the <u> <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html\" target=\"_blank\">  Social Security Administration </a></u>, the national average annual wage was $16,135. This is the equivalent of $36,763 in 2014 wages (<u> <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\" target=\"_blank\">  Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; CPI Inflation Calculator </a></u>). In 2013, the average wage was $44,888 (2014 statistics are yet unavailable). That translates to a wage increase of 22% or 1/10 the relative increase in public institution costs over the same period. I&rsquo;m not sure who should be flogged for this.<h3> But that&rsquo;s just dollars and no sense. Moving right along&hellip;</h3>Those statistical economic &ldquo;facts&rdquo; aside, let&rsquo;s toss in a few observations from my professional life.As an executive search firm, my organization <u> <a href=\"http://www.milewalk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  milewalk </a></u> recruits white-collar employees for our customers (hiring companies). Currently, we have twenty active clients seeking professionals of varying seniority levels across a range of business functions. These functions include sales, marketing, product development, project management, technology, finance, accounting, human resources, recruiting, and a number of others. The clients range from small, privately held companies to large Fortune 500 publicly held organizations.Of those twenty clients, not one single company requires a college degree if the job candidate is the right fit, skill level, and so forth. Zip. Zilch. Zero. Granted, there are exceptions, but their overwhelming sentiment is that experience trumps education. There is absolutely no doubt that many companies will require their professionals to be appropriately educated and certified. This number, however, is significantly smaller than you might imagine.Another important, related note is that according to our salary statistics for the &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; individuals we help our clients secure, there is no wage difference. If you have the experience, you earn what the position pays.I will grant that this is a small sampling size relative to the entire world. Even so, in the history of my company, we have served one hundred twenty clients and only six of them have required college degrees for their positions. That&rsquo;s a mere 5%.I&rsquo;m certainly not claiming it&rsquo;s better to not have a degree. I&rsquo;m simply sharing what we see daily and have observed over the last eleven years.<h3> Shifting gears a bit&hellip;</h3>There are obviously many benefits of achieving a degree that go well beyond the economics. For starters, there is one wonderful certainty. Once you achieve that degree, no one can ever take it away from you. It will always be yours.The reason a college degree&rsquo;s worth is so difficult to evaluate is due to all the non-economic factors and benefits one gains through the actual experience. There are many including the life lessons of living on your own (if you go away to school), the wonderful networking opportunities, the friendships, the sense of accomplishment, and so on.I&rsquo;m not sure what all this means other than the cost of a higher education has skyrocketed over the last three decades. This precipitous rise, which in many cases is tenfold that of wages, has forced people to look more closely at whether the intangible benefits are truly worth it.","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-11 16:27:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-11 16:27:23.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_yBhNvKh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-the-cost-of-college-really-worth-it/\", \"post_id\": \"5349\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-11 16:27:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-11 16:27:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-the-cost-of-college-really-worth-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5348\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2419\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438761681033-6461ffad8d80-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"612\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439377200,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}

But with each of these wins, except for maybe the golf, come tedious paperwork, mailing and filing.</p><h3> Take new client onboarding for example.</h3><p> <br/> Your advisor wins the client, but now he has to go fill out a new account form, make sure that everything is in order, mail it out for a signature, wait for it to come back and go through compliance reviews and approvals. Then if he&rsquo;s lucky and everything was done right the first time, you can file the form away in a place where it won&rsquo;t get lost&mdash;or  maybe even scan it to your network if you&rsquo;ve realized the cost benefits of going paperless (although you should be careful with this method, as simply storing your documents on a network drive usually falls out of line with  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/ecmblog/3-ways-financial-advisors-can-support-regulatory-compliance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SEC and FINRA compliance regulations  </u> </a> ).</p><p> All of this work doesn&rsquo;t just cost your advisor time that could be spent building more client relationships&mdash;it also makes the experience more difficult for the client.

This great momentum is happening all because you can clearly articulate your focus.</p><p> Being able to articulate your focus on women will create immediate interest and inspire others to ask about what you do, which is something every advisors dreams about yet rarely achieves. In fact, articulating your focus on women actually intrigues men and helps to stimulate great conversation. We are NOT talking about using an elevator script, but rather redefining your practice based on your story &ldquo;Why Women&rdquo; to your tribal market and ideal female clients.</p><h3> Become A Women&rsquo;s Wealth Specialist</h3><h3> <br/> Writing Your Introductory Script</h3><p> <br/> My Introductory script contains 4 key components; a title that inspires more interest, a description of your tribal market that stimulates referrals, the 3 core issues that show your clients that you understand, and your 3 Tiffany box solutions that becomes the foundation to your practice and process.</p><p> A good introductory script is built around your tribal market and when executed correctly generates incredible results:</p><li> <strong>  Two minutes to make an impact: </strong> As a sponsor at a community event she had two minutes to capture their audience. She shared her compelling introduction that focused on women, and as a result her booth was mobbed with potential clients.</li><li> <strong>  An introduction that motivates action:  </strong> After attending the same networking event for years and not having much success in acquiring new members, a male financial advisor decided to approach the situation differently by sharing his compelling introduction that focused on women. To his surprise, immediately following the meeting multiple members reached out to him to schedule appointments.</li><li> <strong>  A compelling introduction inspires referrals and appointments: </strong>  At a social event when asked what she did, she took a different approach then simply responding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a financial advisor.&rdquo; Instead she used her compelling introduction and by the end of the conversation a gentleman approached her saying, &ldquo;You need to talk to my Mom. Do you only work with women?&rdquo; The conversations quickly lead to the gentleman scheduling an appointment with her.</li><li> <strong>  A website should make connections and receive a responses: </strong>  After a client read a compelling introduction on the home page of her financial advisor&rsquo;s website the client commented, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize this is what you do, you need to call my friend who is getting a divorce.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  The woman Leaned-In: </strong> In a one-on-one appointment with a couple, the male financial advisor shared his story about why he works with women. As he was sharing his compelling introduction the woman simultaneously leaned in to fully engage herself in the conversation. <br/>  </li><h3> Sample Compelling Introduction:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  So what do you do? </strong></p><p> <strong>  I manage women&rsquo;s wealth. </strong></p><p> <strong>  What do you mean? </strong></p><p> Most of my clients are women who have survived a personal crisis.

{"original_id":2363,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why ABC “Always Be Closing\" Needs to Change","link":"why-abc-always-be-closing-needs-to-change","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You&rsquo;ve heard the words behind the ABC acronym before &ndash; Always Be Closing, as the popular interpretation goes. For some, it&rsquo;s a mission statement, even a way of life. But what does it really mean? All of the emphasis in this version of ABC points to closing. The sale is the end-all of the entire marketing interaction, and everything else is secondary, if it registers at all. Close one deal, don&rsquo;t look back, and move right along to the next one. As long as the cycle keeps churning, everyone&rsquo;s happy&hellip; right?</p><p> A closing, by definition, is the end of something. Closing a sale means that the money has changed hands, and your interaction with the buyer is at an end. This is a dangerous way to market, especially on social platforms. Think of it as closing by any means necessary. That means not worrying about all of the customers that impersonal marketing turns off, as long as the sales numbers stay strong. It&rsquo;s a short-sighted philosophy, and it comes with plenty of unwelcome long-term consequences.</p><p> <strong>  This version of ABC is used to justify all sorts of counter-productive marketing tactics: </strong></p><li> Automated messages on social lead to poor engagement and unhappy customers? Doesn&rsquo;t matter, as long as you&rsquo;re closing.</li><li> Sign a bunch of customers up for your email list, fill their inbox with unwanted marketing content, and make opting out next to impossible? As long as you can justify the investment with a few short-term sales, who cares? <br/>  </li><h3> Rethinking ABC</h3><p> <br/> You can probably see where this is going. It&rsquo;s time to ditch the old ABC rule, and find a message more suitable for the reality of modern marketing. Actually, we can even keep the original A and B. Instead of closing, though, let&rsquo;s focus the C on connecting. Always Be Connecting has a much nicer ring to it, doesn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s also a much better way of doing business. In the long run,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.returnonrelationship.com/?page_id=14\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Return on Relationship, #RonR  </a> </u>  is always going to win out over playing the numbers game with social.</p><p> So, what does &ldquo;Always Be Connecting&rdquo; mean? Connecting is much more open-ended than closing, and it means using social to build real, meaningful relationships. When someone sends you a request, respond personally. Look at their profile, make note of common interests, and bring them up when you chat.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re the one sending the request, look for them on as many social channels as you can. Show that you&rsquo;re genuinely interested in them, and they&rsquo;re likely to return the favor. If someone sends you a message, don&rsquo;t wait to reply. Find an article your connection would be interested in, and send it to them with a little note. As you get to know a new connection, cement the relationship with a phone call, or offer to meet up in person. There are countless ways to connect, and all you&rsquo;ve got to do is be human.</p><h3> The Benefits of Connecting</h3><p> <br/> None of this means that you need to forget about closing sales. Instead, it&rsquo;s about refocusing the emphasis onto your connections. Approach people from common ground, and build the relationship from there. The marketing part is still there, but now it&rsquo;s coming from a place of genuine interest on both sides.</p><p> Many may think this does not scale, but it does. Word spreads quickly on social, for better and worse. No matter how you treat people, others are going to hear about it. In the end, it comes down to one question: What type of marketer do youwant to be? Build relationships, and the close comes naturally. Force the close, and the relationship falls to pieces. Make this one &ldquo;C&rdquo; change in your ABC formula, and you&rsquo;ll see a big difference in results. Building a culture of connection, rather than simply focusing on the close, will result in a long-term relationship that will increase the lifetime value of your customers, increase the average order value, and make future purchases more frequent.</p><p> Focus on the relationship first, getting to know your customers and prospects, and giving them reasons to stay engaged&hellip; not just getting them to react.</p><p> This post originally appeared on  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TedRubin.com  </a> </u></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-10 20:52:54.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-10 20:52:54.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_0pAkdDQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-abc-always-be-closing-needs-to-change/\", \"post_id\": \"5336\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-10 20:52:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-10 20:52:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-abc-always-be-closing-needs-to-change\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5335\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2413\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-10-at-2.00.02-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"626\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439321400,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}

Apparently he&rsquo;s an idiot, won&rsquo;t listen, does his own thing, is over confident and clearly doesn&rsquo;t realize how unpredictable the financial markets are! Doesn&rsquo;t he know what&rsquo;s happening in Europe?</p><p> As my friend takes a breath, I ask her if perhaps her behavioral biases are showing? I know her well, not just as a friend, but also having facilitated her completing the Financial DNA Discovery process. She&rsquo;s Risk Averse and very Anchored with a focus on following a structured plan based on her own experiences. Yet, normally the advisor is perfectly capable of managing her personal bias when working with clients. So what was different about this client? Apparently, he heard about a great opportunity to buy a holiday home in Canada. In addition, he was going to buy a top of the range snow mobile. If this wasn&rsquo;t enough, he intended to cash in considerable stock to have the mountain cabin extended.</p><h3> The question then becomes has my advisory friend properly got underneath the surface to discover the true motivations of the client?</h3><p> <br/> It may be that the client has a deeper purpose for buying the holiday home that outweighs pure financial rationality.</p><p> <strong>  In his article titled Quiet Conversations in the Journal of Financial Planning, Meir Statman discusses the Expressive Nature of Socially Responsible Investors:  </strong> Financial advisors accept many preferences of clients and construct portfolios reflecting these preferences. They accept clients&rsquo; preference for low-risk by constructing low-risk portfolios. Advisors accept the home bias of clients, even if they advise against it, by allocating little to international stocks. They accept clients&rsquo; desire for status symbols by investing in hedge funds that accept only the very rich. Advisors accept clients&rsquo; preference to splurge on cruises, even if they themselves would jump overboard if forced on one. It is time for financial advisors to accept the preference for socially responsible investments as well. SOURCE:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.journalfp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.journalfp.net  </a> </u></p><p> Over the past year, my advisor friend had been talking to her client about socially responsible investing. She believed he had made the decision to address this by investing in socially responsible companies which also generated returns. This was an area that the advisor had considerable experience in. They had discussed at some length Amy Domini and her approach to ..shareholder advocacy and community investing which she saw as pillars of socially responsible investing. SOURCE:  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.domini.com/why-domini/meet-amy-domini\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   https://www.domini.com/why-domini/meet-amy-domini  </a> </u></p><p> I knew from the Financial DNA Discovery process that my friend&rsquo;s natural inherent behavior was all about minimizing risks and keeping clients from making investments that did not seem financially rational. With further questioning, I began to realize she had allowed her own natural bias to rule the conversation. I also explained that in response to her reaction that she should consider the client&rsquo;s perspective based on his behavioral biases. Had the client, based on his behavioral biases, made an investment which serves a lifestyle objective and also meets a more altruistic objective?</p><h3> Behavioral bias in the financial decision-making area can be a real issue.</h3><p> <br/> Yes, the client may have initially appeared an idiot in terms of what he was proposing, but financial advisors need to park their bias and probe the client to understand what they are trying to achieve.</p><p> Wikipedia defines Bias thus: Bias is an inclination of temperament or outlook to present or hold a partial perspective, often accompanied by a refusal to consider the possible merits of alternative points of view. People may be biased toward or against an individual, a race, a religion, a social class, a political party, or a species. Biased means one-sided, lacking a neutral viewpoint, not having an open mind. Bias can come in many forms and is often considered to be synonymous with prejudice or bigotry. SOURCE:  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias\" target=\"_blank\">   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias  </a> </u></p><p> Subsequent meetings with the client revealed that he was cashing in his stock to make these purchases in order to provide a snow holiday vacation program for underprivileged children and their parents. This was his answer to being socially responsible. To my financial advisor friend he had initially appeared an idiot; had she managed her bias and reaction, she would have understood her client&rsquo;s inherent behaviors and bias. <strong>  Given the client&rsquo;s biases and his choice, the advisors role should be to help maximize the disposition of the stocks to fund his investment. Next time your first reaction is what an idiot&rsquo;, stop and think about your own behavioral bias. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-10 19:05:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-10 19:05:47.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_VhiUrYh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/my-client-is-an-idiot-or-is-my-behavioral-bias-showing/\", \"post_id\": \"5334\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-10 19:05:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-10 19:05:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"my-client-is-an-idiot-or-is-my-behavioral-bias-showing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5333\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2412\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-10-at-1.35.06-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"814\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439292600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

If you&rsquo;re in the middle of it, you&rsquo;re probably thinking that&rsquo;s the biggest understatement you&rsquo;ve heard in quite a while! You&rsquo;ve had to gather, copy, organize and read through a tremendous amount of paperwork (and it may have been the first time you laid eyes on some of it). But it&rsquo;s all worth it. You now have significant files of financial information at the ready. You&rsquo;ve come a long way in terms of financial awareness and organization. And you&rsquo;ll be able to put all of that to use in your new life as a single woman.</p><p> Once your divorce is final, the paperwork won&rsquo;t be so constant or so intense &ndash; but, there still will be divorce-related chores to be done before you move ahead. For example, you&rsquo;ll need to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2013/12/04/divorcing-women-dont-forget-to-update-these-key-documents/\" target=\"_blank\">   update key documents  </a> </u>  to accurately reflect your new status.</p><p> As part of that process, it&rsquo;s especially important to revisit the named beneficiaries on life insurance policies, retirement plans, annuities, TOD (transfer on death) bank and brokerage accounts, and any other instruments on which a beneficiary is designated. It was perfectly reasonable to name your husband as beneficiary when the two of you were happily married. Once you&rsquo;re divorced, in almost all cases, you&rsquo;ll want to name someone else. If you haven&rsquo;t already, now is the time to think about who should receive benefits upon your death &ndash;and you&rsquo;ll need to officially designate those persons as beneficiaries on all applicable forms.</p><h3> Some women want to change their beneficiary designations before filing for divorce.</h3><p> <br/> That can work, but it also can be potentially troublesome &ndash;particularly if you take action before you have the &ldquo;divorce discussion&rdquo; with your husband. You might intend to make the change discreetly, for instance, but if you and your husband use the same financial advisor, your husband may likely be informed of the change. In addition, changes in beneficiary designations on ERISA retirement accounts &mdash; 401(k)s, </p><p> 403(b)s, pensions, etc., but not IRAs &mdash; require the written consent of the other spouse.</p><p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;ve already rewritten/revised your will to   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2011/04/26/should-you-disinherit-your-husband/\" target=\"_blank\">    disinherit your ex-husband   </a>  </u>  , </strong> you might be under the impression that you&rsquo;ve done everything necessary regarding beneficiaries. Unfortunately, that isn&rsquo;t so! Please be aware:Beneficiary designations supersede whatever is specified in your will. That means even if you&rsquo;ve changed your will, he could still inherit certain assets &ndash; unless you also specifically changed the beneficiary designations on each one.</p><p> In trying to prevent that, some states have enacted laws that give life insurance carriers a measure of flexibility regarding whom to pay, and when.</p><p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://info.legalzoom.com/floridas-law-contesting-beneficiary-life-insurance-policy-25785.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Florida  </a> </u> , for example, a 2012 legislative change gave insurance carriers significant latitude in determining to whom benefits should be paid. An insurer can review the marital status of the deceased, and the relationship between the deceased and their stated beneficiary. If the deceased is listed as single, divorced, or married to someone other than the named beneficiary, the insurer can legally pay benefits to a secondary beneficiary instead.</p><p> Missouri has taken a slightly different approach. The law there now specifies that in some cases, unless a former spouse is specificallyrenamed as the beneficiary after divorce, it is assumed there that life insurance benefits should be paid to someone else. (According to  <a href=\"http://www.moinsurancedenial.com/life-insurance-blog/entry/are-you-the-beneficiary-of-ex-spouses-life-insurance-policy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this article </a> , this statute does not apply to all policies.)</p><p> <strong>  On one hand, new laws concerning beneficiaries can be seen as positive, protective measures. </strong> If you neglect to change your named beneficiaries after divorce, some such laws might prevent your ex from collecting the proceeds of your life insurance policy when it&rsquo;s not what you intended to have happen. On the other hand, it is potentially troubling that the state could assume the authority to second-guess your wishes after your death. It&rsquo;s clearly best to make your wishes explicitly and legally known to all concerned, well in advance.</p><p> On top of all of the above, should you (or your estate) become embroiled in a legal battle over beneficiaries that reaches a federal court, there is another factor to consider. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that when a conflict exists between federal and state laws in such cases, the federal law prevails. That is, even if an applicable state law says that divorce automatically removes an ex-spouse as beneficiary, federal law could negate that. In fact, court decisions have been made in favor of the named beneficiary even when that person has signed a valid spousal waiver!</p><p> <strong>  The clear take-away from all this: </strong> Change each and every one of your beneficiary designations individually, and do it as soon as you can legally do so. Neglecting that paperwork could cost your intended beneficiaries untold time, expense, and legal trouble trying to collect the benefits you wished them to have.</p><p> ###</p><p> <strong>  Reminder:  </strong> Even with new legislation in some states, leaving named beneficiaries unchanged can be a tremendously expensive mistake. Should you die without having done so, your ex-husband could stand to receive assets you would never have wanted for him to inherit. More importantly, your children, or whomever else you would really want to receive those benefits, could be left out in the cold.</p><p> <strong>  Hot tip:  </strong> Issues regarding named beneficiaries can be problematic for divorced women. If you are named as beneficiary on your ex-husband&rsquo;s life insurance policy, and/or if his life insurance is being used to insure payments of alimony and child support to you, be careful. Some of these new laws might void your right to collect as a former spouse, even though the life insurance was intended for your benefit! To avoid difficulties and unintended consequences, be absolutely sure you are renamed as beneficiary once the divorce is finalized.</p><p> <strong>  Legal matters:  </strong> Because of elective share rights, you cannot completely disinherit your husband while you are still married. Depending on the state you live in and whether or not you have children, elective share usually ranges from 1/3 to &frac12;. That means that the &ldquo;disinherited&rdquo; spouse would still receive 1/3 to &frac12; of marital assets, even if he/she has been cut out. Automatic Temporary Restraining Orders (ATROs) often prevent either spouse from making any changes once the divorce action has commenced.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-10 18:55:25.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-10 18:55:25.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_LJYbmKE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/divorcing-women-what-to-know-about-beneficiary-designation-laws/\", \"post_id\": \"5332\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-10 18:55:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-10 18:55:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"divorcing-women-what-to-know-about-beneficiary-designation-laws\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5331\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2411\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-10-at-11.54.16-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1057\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439293500,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}

It didn&rsquo;t feel right, but she wasn&rsquo;t sure she could do anything about it.  When she called, I got that &ldquo;slow burn&rdquo; feeling that comes over me when I hear about financial elder abuse. As a consultant for folks with  <a href=\"http://www.agingparents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   aging parents  </u>  , </a>  it&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve heard this kind of story.</p><p> <strong>  Carrie and her brothers were supposed to all share authority on the Durable Power of Attorney for Mom.   </strong> Mom and her lawyer had set it up that way, at Mom&rsquo;s request. It&rsquo;s nice in theory, this idea of being democratic.  It&rsquo;s just not practical. Unwittingly, the lawyer had put the 3 siblings into a trap. One could say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any decision and none of them could move forward.   They didn&rsquo;t all trust each other and clearly, there was a deliberate attempt to exclude Carrie from the money decisions.</p><p> Mom has dementia, Carrie reports.  This makes her vulnerable, even if she is functioning fairly well in caring for herself at this time.</p><p> Carrie&rsquo;s brothers are starting down the path of making themselves suspects of the crime of elder abuse. Besides shutting Carrie out of the decisions, they&rsquo;ve taken her car, and are using her credit cards for personal things.  This is a brewing crisis.</p><h3> Here are 7 warning signs everyone needs to know about if this is happening in your family.</h3><p> <br/> These are, by themselves, not necessarily dangerous, but any combination of them should raise suspicion and trigger action from those who worry about abuse.</p><p> <strong>  1. A family member becomes secretive about the   <u>   <a href=\"http://agingparents.com/about-parent-finances.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    parent&rsquo;s finances   </a>   .  </u> </strong></p><p> In this case, a long standing pattern of making Mom&rsquo;s books available to all 3 siblings was altered.  Carrie knew what Mom&rsquo;s  regular expenses were and what she spent every month.  Mom is 87.  When Carrie got excluded from online access to Mom&rsquo;s accounts, it raised a red flag.</p><p> <strong>  2.  A family member lives with the parent and depends on the parent for financial support. </strong></p><p> Carrie&rsquo;s brother Jack lives with Mom. He has a job, but Mom pays all his bills. This has gone on for some time.  Now, he&rsquo;s using Mom&rsquo;s credit card and he apparently doesn&rsquo;t want Carrie to see what he&rsquo;s spending.  Sometimes this situation is a recipe for abuse because it&rsquo;s just too easy to rip off the aging parent, who is vulnerable to manipulation.</p><p> <strong>  3.  A family member begins to isolate the aging parent from others. </strong></p><p>      When there is anyone blocking visits, restricting access of other family members to the elder, it&rsquo;s another red flag. The potential abuser doesn&rsquo;t want anyone looking too closely at what is going on and the method to avoid scrutiny is to keep the elder away from the other family members.</p><p> <strong>  4.  An adult child insists on being present when anyone else is with the aging parent. </strong></p><p> This can be a sign that an adult child is threatening the aging parent if he/she talks about the financial manipulation that the elder knows is going on.  If the elder has concerns, the abuser doesn&rsquo;t want the aging parent to reveal this to anyone and may have frightened the elder into silence.</p><p> <strong>  5.  A family member has a substance abuse problem and has influence over an aging parent with  <a href=\"http://agingparents.com/about-parent-finances.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">       <u>    memory problems   </u>  </a>  . </strong></p><p> Drug and alcohol dependency can make a liar out of just about anyone who has this issue.  Memory impaired aging parents are &ldquo;easy pickings&rdquo; for money to support the dependency habit.  The adult child or other relative uses the relationship with the elder to manipulate &ldquo;loans&rdquo; out of the elder and the elder forgets what happened or can&rsquo;t make sense of it but says yes.</p><p> <strong>  6.  Sudden change in estate planning documents, particularly Durable Power of Attorney, Trustee or signatory on a bank or brokerage account.   </strong> Cognitive impairment begins subtly at first, but the elder is vulnerable to manipulation even in the earliest stages of dementia.  When names on legal documents suddenly get added or removed, it is a suspicious sign, particularly if there is no obvious need to make such changes.</p><p> <strong>  7.  Kidnapping and moving the elder to an adult child&rsquo;s home without notice to anyone or discussion with anyone else. </strong></p><p> This is a tricky problem.  If adult protective services asks the elder if he/she wants to be with the adult child and the elder says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; there is nothing APS is going to do at that point.  More evidence of elder abuse will be needed to get law enforcement involved.  If you are suspicious, start poking into the situation as soon as you see the first red flag.

My work allows me to get to know some extraordinary people. What always seems to surprise me is, more often than not, they don&rsquo;t recognize how extraordinary they really are.</p><p> Take Jessica for instance (all names have been changed to protect the extraordinary). I will always remember Jessica.  She showed up in one of my programs a few years ago, a powerful, dynamic woman with an intense drive to achieve. A lot of emerging leaders share her hunger for achievement, but there was something special about this beautiful woman that I couldn&rsquo;t quite put my finger on. She seemed to have a flame that burned so brightly within her, but was reticent to let it breath. Almost like she was afraid it would burn out of control and consume those around her.</p><p> The more often I do what I do, the more I see this struggle as a human struggle, something we all battle from time to time with varying degrees of success. It&rsquo;s the internal battle we fight to release the power of who we really are out into the world. Holding it in feels safer. The fragile who-we-really-are can&rsquo;t be judged or hurt. We protect that part of ourselves. Holding it in can also feel heroic for some people. If we protect others from who-we-really-are, then they&rsquo;ll be safe. So of course, keeping who-we-really-are locked up inside seems sensible. We&rsquo;re safe. They&rsquo;re safe. It&rsquo;s all good.</p><h3> Except, it&rsquo;s not (all good that is). It comes at a cost.</h3><p> <br/> When you think about the best leaders throughout history, they&rsquo;re not folks who played it safe. They likely had/have internal struggles, insecurities, fears, doubts, just like the rest of us human creatures.  <strong>  Yet they risked being themselves anyway. </strong>  And that&rsquo;s what made them special. Sure, they accomplished important things, and did cool stuff, but none of that could come to pass had they kept themselves from fully showing up in the world. Had Bill Gates worried about offending people because he is so driven, Microsoft would have never been born. Had Gandhi worried about being too opinionated, nothing would have changed in India. If Oprah Winfrey had not listened to her instincts and had only done what the networks were dictating (in a media that was dominated by sensationalism), she would have never been able to create an empire that is focused on making a positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives (and oh, make lots and lots of money in the process).  <strong>  These leaders succeeded because of being themselves. </strong></p><p> But it&rsquo;s tough! And sometimes painful. I&rsquo;ve been working really hard at consistently showing up as my quirky, energetic, passionate self in my work. The more I do, the better I feel, the more fun I have, and the more effective I am. Yet who I am doesn&rsquo;t work for some people, and that&rsquo;s hard to take. The natural tendency is to start pulling back. To be less of who I am. But by reining ourselves in, so nobody will judge us harshly, we only succeed in staying off the radar.</p><p> Which means, we&rsquo;re off the radar.</p><p> For everyone.</p><p> Nobody follows someone who is off the radar.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t get important stuff done if nobody follows.</p><p> Being off the radar makes it impossible to lead.</p><p> <strong>  By reining ourselves in, so nobody will judge us, we only succeed in staying off the radar.  Nobody follows someone who is off the radar. </strong></p><p> As I spent more time with Jessica, I discovered amazing things. I learned that her mother had played a powerful role in the history of our country. I learned that Jessica had gone on to college at 16! I learned that working to be her best and driving toward the pinnacle of achievement is part of the fabric of her life and is what makes her the extraordinary woman that she is today. What an inspiration!</p><p> I also learned that she&rsquo;s been holding herself back. Her fear of imposing high expectations was keeping that fire locked inside. Instead of sharing her incredible story &ndash; a story that has the power to inspire and motivate others &ndash; she was closing a big part of herself off to those around her, and it was having an impact. It was having an impact on how others experienced her, on her ability to truly lead, and most importantly, on how she experienced herself.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s what makes my job so cool. At the beginning of the day, I see a group of extraordinary people. At the end of the day, they see that in themselves.</p><p> They see themselves as the extraordinary leaders they are.</p><h3> Your real self is what makes you extraordinary.  </h3><p> <br/> As Jessica stood on the stage at the end of the day, she spoke with eloquence and passion, her strength fueled by a fire that had been lit from within.  She had finally given herself permission to be who she is and it showed.</p><p> <strong>  Off the radar no more! </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-10 18:06:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-10 18:06:01.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_1xDaFjO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-off-the-radar/\", \"post_id\": \"5328\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-10 18:06:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-10 18:06:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-off-the-radar\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5327\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2409\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-10-at-11.06.08-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"423\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439316000,"author_id":281,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2358,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Familiar with Growth Hacking?","link":"are-you-familiar-with-growth-hacking","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Danielle Kogan | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/digitaleyemedia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Digital EYE Media  </u> </a></p><p> Growth hacking is a relatively new term, coined in 2010 by  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/05/29/sean-ellis-the-rise-of-the-growth-hacker/\" target=\"_blank\">   Sean Ellis  </a> </u> , an expert in startup marketing and growth. It&rsquo;s often thrown around as a marketing term, but it&rsquo;s not exactly marketing. <strong>  It&rsquo;s a new business philosophy. </strong> Whereas  <u>  marketing </u>  is more about creating profit, growth is about organic, sustainable change.</p><p> You&rsquo;re aware by now that content marketing is a mainstay of the current consumer model. What you may not realize is that content creation is necessary for the concept of growth hacking to even exist. Think about it. Most Internet businesses are not selling physical products (or they&rsquo;re not only selling physical products). They need consumers to buy their brand.</p><p> What is Facebook selling? Exactly. Many businesses are selling intangibles. They offer the ability for people to connect, share, and work in new ways. And, even if you sell physical goods, you are now a part of that intangible network, using those same methods: web pages, blogs, and social media. You need branded content in order to effect growth.</p><h3> What Is Growth Hacking?</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve all become familiar with the term hacker. We have computer hackers, life hackers, and illegal blackhat hackers. According to Brian Harvey of UC Berkeley, a computer hacker &ldquo;is someone who lives and breathes computers, who knows all about computers, who can get a computer to do anything.&rdquo; A growth hacker, likewise, knows all about growth.</p><p> Being a growth hacker is about finding creative ways to encourage business growth. Just as a life hacker finds inventive ways to succeed at life, a growth hacker directs ingenuity towards business success. A growth hacker is not the same as a computer hacker, but they do use technology-based solutions in order to crack the code of successful online branding.</p><p> <strong>  What are some tenets of growth hacking? </strong></p><li> <strong>  Change&mdash; </strong> Growth hacking is about individual growth in order to promote company growth. A company that holds its employees back in order to create a stable workforce is working against itself. Growth is change. In order to maintain sustainable growth at any business, you need regular change. That means your low-level employees should be growing and either moving on or moving up. That is to say, you want driven people engaged in your business. Similarly, the individual growth of each consumer you influence results in positive change for your business, as well.</li><li> <strong>  Technology&mdash; </strong> A growth hacker must be aware of trends in technology and social media. Although they are not doing computer hacking, they are hacking the technological communication system. In order to innovate, they must understand the current players.</li><li> <strong>  Opportunity&mdash; </strong> Growth hackers are always on the lookout for opportunities and ways to connect. If you can find a new way to use an existing platform, you are on your way to growth. Take  <u>  <a href=\"https://growthhackers.com/companies/airbnb/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Airbnb  </a> </u> , for instance. They latched onto the chance to use Craigslist as an existing platform, and their business skyrocketed. Take note, also, that they are selling something entirely intangible&mdash;just a new and specific way for people to connect for places to stay. When you make connections (both in the networking sense and in the creative sense), you find new opportunities. <br/>  </li><p> Now, one thing to understand about Airbnb&rsquo;s success (and that you should apply to your own methods) is that they came up with something entirely new. They succeeded because they found an opportunity, had the technical skills to act on it and were ready to create change for themselves and others. Additionally, they used that chance to grow, but not to become stagnant and depend upon Craigslist. Because of Craigslist&rsquo;s new policies, they would have failed if they had done so.</p><h3> Will the Real Growth Hackers Please Stand Up?</h3><p> <br/> You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to hire a professional growth hacker for your business, although that is now a legitimate position that people are filling in companies. The truth is, anyone can learn to be a growth hacker. It just takes individuals in your company who are willing to see potential avenues for reaching your niche.  <u>  <a href=\"https://creator.wework.com/knowledge/stop-trying-hire-growth-hacker/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Growth hacking takes people who are present for more than just &ldquo;doing the job&rdquo;  </a> </u> . It takes personal investment.</p><p> It also takes a team effort. The person who comes up with the ingenious idea may not necessarily be the person who handles the technological details.</p><p> Usually, a real growth hacker cannot be a paid position. Why? Because the person must be invested in the success of your business. Hiring a professional growth hacker will often lead to uninspired ideas that are rehashed from the individual&rsquo;s previous projects. Let&rsquo;s be clear, when ideas for growth are rehashed, they&rsquo;re not fresh, and that&rsquo;s not growth hacking.</p><p> Instead of looking for someone who knows how to do growth, be your own growth hacker. Invest your creativity into how your product or service can make pathways. Not every hack will work, but the more you try, the better you will become at finding and acting on those opportunities.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-10 17:53:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-10 17:53:40.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_luIvhHc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-familiar-with-growth-hacking/\", \"post_id\": \"5326\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-10 17:53:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-10 17:53:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-familiar-with-growth-hacking\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5325\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2408\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-10-at-10.58.29-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"357\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439320500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

The research firm  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/emails-expected-to-rise-to-140-a-day-in-2018/story-e6frfm9r-1226904239876\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   projects  </a> </u>  that the figure will rise to 140 by 2018.</p><p> Since you&rsquo;ll be sending and receiving more and more emails on a near-daily basis, the question&rsquo;s worth asking: how confident are you in your email skills? Consider the following 13 workplace email faux pas so you can avoid them:</p><li> <strong>  Forwarding questionable emails:  </strong> A business email account is not the same thing as a personal one. So even though a colleague might have sent you the cutest kitten pictures ever, think twice before forwarding them to your boss during work hours.</li><li> <strong>  Writing too informally:  </strong> This isn&rsquo;t the same email chain that all your buddies from college are on. So be polite and conscientious. Avoid using abbreviations (e.g., &ldquo;plz,&rdquo; &ldquo;tx,&rdquo; &ldquo;lol&rdquo;) unless you&rsquo;re certain that you&rsquo;re comfortable enough with your business partners on the receiving end of your messages. </li><li> <strong>  Sending a message to the wrong person:  </strong> It&rsquo;s certainly not uncommon for today&rsquo;s workers to have more than one &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; in their contact lists, for example. Be sure to double-check your email is addressed to the right folks to save yourself embarrassment at best, or sending privileged information to the wrong person at worst. Better yet, enable the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1284885?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">   undo send  </a> </u> &rdquo; feature if your email client supports it. </li><li> <strong>  Escalating an email unnecessarily: </strong>  Don&rsquo;t involve your manager in a dispute you can handle on your own. For example,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2011/07/26/10-email-mistakes-that-could-cost-you-your-job/\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes  </a> </u>  tells a story of a 30-something web designer who ended up hurting her career by copying her supervisor on an email chain when she and a colleague couldn&rsquo;t agree on an issue. Though her intentions were pure, her coworker got furious, and her manager felt it was a bad move. She left the company shortly thereafter. </li><li> <strong>  Following up too quickly:  </strong> The world doesn&rsquo;t revolve around the emails you write. If a colleague, a coworker, or even an employee doesn&rsquo;t respond to your messages right this second, take a deep breath and relax. Everyone&rsquo;s busy, so some people might not be able to respond to your inquiries right away. It&rsquo;s perfectly okay to nudge your contacts after a few business days. And managers, of course, can expect their workers to respond quickly &mdash; not instantly. Just be reasonable. </li><li> <strong>  Littering your messages with emoticons:  </strong> While those who use emoticons (like :-), :-(, and others) in their emails may be trying to show the world how nice they are, those on the receiving end of such messages may think the sender is a bit juvenile. To eliminate the possibility you&rsquo;re perceived that way, convey your pleasant personality through words (e.g., &ldquo;Have a fantastic weekend!&rdquo;).</li><li> <strong>  Taking too long to respond to simple inquiries:  </strong> You certainly don&rsquo;t have to drop everything you&rsquo;re doing to respond to the emails you receive the second they light up your inbox. But people certainly appreciate quicker responses. Do your best to keep your inbox as close to zero as you can (i.e., respond to messages as quickly as is reasonably possible).</li><li> <strong>  Being the 50th person to hit &ldquo;reply all&rdquo;: </strong>  Everyone&rsquo;s been on one of those never-ending email chains that keep clogging your inbox. While it&rsquo;s certainly fine to be quick to join in on congratulating a colleague on a promotion, for example, try not to be the guy or gal who writes &ldquo;Great news, Rick!&rdquo; four days and fifty replies later.</li><li> <strong>  Copying unnecessary people on simple correspondence:  </strong> Back to those stats from The Radicati Group: workers are getting more emails than ever before, and the projections indicate that the trend will continue for the foreseeable future. Copying people on unessential messages simply adds to their already cluttered inboxes. Only send messages to people who need to see them.</li><li> <strong>  Requiring your employees to copy you on all messages: </strong>  Though the NSA may be reading all of our emails, workers still expect a modicum of privacy in their business inboxes &mdash; they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable having their bosses read every single note they write. If you&rsquo;re requiring your employees to copy you on every email they send, stop it right now.</li><li> <strong>  Letting your emotions infiltrate your inbox: </strong>  Mad at a coworker or colleague for seemingly dropping the ball on a project? Ticked off by the tone your boss assumed in an email asking you to do something quickly? It&rsquo;s best not to let your emotions affect the words written in your emails. Rather than quickly firing off a snarky response you might soon regret, take a walk to collect your thoughts before replying. </li><li> <strong>  Clicking \"send\" too quickly:  </strong> Everyone&rsquo;s sent an email and subsequently realized they didn&rsquo;t convey everything they intended to say. Do your best to ensure all the ideas you wish to get across are included in your message before you send it by checking and double-checking your work. You don&rsquo;t want to send coworkers or clients any more emails than is absolutely necessary (within reason). Remember, clutter causes fatigue.</li><li> <strong>  Saying too much: </strong>  Email is the preferred mode of business communication because workers are able to ask and answers questions quickly &mdash; at their own convenience. That said, we&rsquo;ve all received emails that appear as though they were penned by James Joyce (i.e., impossibly large blocks of text that seemingly go on forever, the ramblings of which are nearly indecipherable). Sure, from time to time, situations may merit a more in-depth approach.

{"original_id":2356,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Value of Value in Context","link":"the-value-of-value-in-context","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;m not usually one for talking about sport in a professional context, and certainly not on my blog, despite being a huge fan of English football. Not everyone shares the same passions and I completely understand how annoying it could be listening to a group talk about football when you have no interest in it, especially when it&rsquo;s in a work situation.</p><p> However, an article written by a well-known sports writer months back really stuck in my mind and I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about it since.</p><p> In his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/blog/marcotti-musings/62/post/2005652/man-united-will-be-better-with-angel-di-maria-but-are-they-paying-too-much-gab-marcotti\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article  </a> </u> , Gabrielle Marcotti commented on how Manchester United have splashed out obscene amounts of money on big-name players over the past few months.</p><p> It&rsquo;s surprising, because it goes against a cultural philosophy that has defined the club in recent years. Man Utd, for those who don&rsquo;t follow the game closely, have never really been the kind of club who buy in global superstars. Instead, they&rsquo;ve achieved enviable success by (mostly) identifying the right young players early and nurturing them to greatness.</p><h3> Things have changed though.</h3><p> <br/> Manchester United are, by their own standards, a club in something of a crisis. A generational change in leadership has left them in real danger of falling out of the elite, at least in terms of performance. The outcome is they have spent in one close season big-name transfer money like literally never before. There is an air of panic about their activity.</p><p> As Gabe expresses well in the article, it&rsquo;s the equivalent of the drowning man, who would probably be unwilling to pay $15 for a flotation device at any time except for the very moment he needs it most, when he would pay whatever price needed.</p><p> A similar analogy is that of an alarm system, potentially too expensive to all but those who appreciate the downside of having their belongings or car stolen. Life insurance is another great example of a value in context situation.</p><p> <strong>  The point traverses simple sporting matters. </strong> The context of a purchase significantly defines buying behaviour. I paid far more than I usually would for a new shirt just before a speaking gig after I went and spilled coffee on myself. My most motivated clients are those who have very clear goals to achieve or problems they want to get rid of. Man Utd are paying silly money for players they likely would have passed on two years ago because the cost to them of not acting hugely outweighs the fees they have paid.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s no different when it comes to selling advice.</h3><p> <br/> Understanding the context behind what has motivated a potential client to begin a conversation specifically here and now is absolutely vital. That information &ndash; the background story &ndash; has such a significant impact on how value is perceived. It not only defines the likelihood of a successful engagement, but also how motivated the client is going to be participate in your process.</p><p> That last bit is key! Of all the efficiency problems I&rsquo;m talking to advice businesses about right now, the lack of client motivation is one causing the big issues. Clients not returning information, phone calls, emails or generally helping the process along &ndash; far more than systems and process &ndash; are the real sticking points that clog up businesses.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not just about understanding the context though. It&rsquo;s also about influencing clients to better self-assess it too.</p><p> The reality is most people don&rsquo;t know the path they are on may not result in the financial and lifestyle outcomes they want. They&rsquo;ve over-wished and under-implemented, or even worse haven&rsquo;t wished at all. Some are in denial. They&rsquo;re the equivalent of Man Utd without a league table to refer to, assuming everything will be okay and their supremacy will continue by default.</p><p> <strong>  That&rsquo;s how I see great advisers (or advice-givers in general, in their many forms) making a real difference. </strong> They are able to challenge others to consider the real context that lies underneath the assumptions most people make about their financial wellbeing. They make clients realise, rather than telling them what to think, the value of making different choices, changing behaviour and looking at things from a different perspective. Then they make it easier to take initial action, and keep taking action year after year. The same goes for other spheres of business, whether it be fitness training, managing teams or, dare I say, business coaching. It&rsquo;s here the big value is created and, where you create big value for others, success is rarely far behind.</p><p> Manchester United may have paid more than they did in the past, but the key thing is not the fees they&rsquo;ve paid, but the actions they&rsquo;ve taken. I&rsquo;d suggest it&rsquo;s those actions that will ensure the club&rsquo;s current deflated status will ultimately prove to be a passing phase.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-10 17:05:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-10 17:05:12.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_L4vchiA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-value-of-value-in-context/\", \"post_id\": \"5322\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-10 17:05:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-10 17:05:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-value-of-value-in-context\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5321\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2406\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-10-at-10.07.40-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"680\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439301600,"author_id":456,"chart_url":""}

Spending choices are a lot more challenging when you exist in a society of conspicuous consumers.

With the exception of their company 401(k) contributions, they were not building their net worth at anywhere near the pace they needed or wanted.</p><p> Review your annual spending and determine whether you are at a surplus or living at a deficit (which means you needed to go into savings or credit cards to meet your outflow). Looking back, without self blame or shame: are you satisfied with the decisions you made? What could you have done better or differently?</p><p> If you can spot areas where you might have made different decisions, think about how you can apply that thinking right now and in your future.

Working backwards, you can now establish a more realistic target for your goals.</p><p> Sonia and Peter completed that exercise&mdash;and found a shocking amount of wasted or low-value spending. They discussed what had triggered their decisions and realized that their impulsiveness detracted from their larger, more complex goals. They shifted their focus to how they could help each other make better choices going forward. It was the &ldquo;a-ha&rdquo; that would begin to change their thinking and their actions.</p><p> Begin at the end and work backwards.

However, it&rsquo;s hot, because it is perceived as being &ldquo;new,&rdquo; but also for showing a 200-300% increase in sales and generating a lot of new traffic for internet retailers.</p><p> <strong>  In contrast to that, I have had small business and startup clients ignore the notion of a &ldquo;discounted price&rdquo; and &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo; as critical factors in operating their business. For example: </strong></p><li> One designed a new apparel product with small volumes and numerous special, but insignificant, details that brought the retail price to $30. But the general market price is $15-$20.</li><li> Another designer produces luxury accessory items made of beautiful fabrics for over $200 retail. The rationale is there are plenty items in that category that sell for over $200, however ignoring that most of those expensive items are from high-end names, and that the key prices for the item even in better retailers are $35-$100.</li><li> A third client, who is in the home textile industry, has specialized in printing small volumes of multiple styles in the United States. However, he is needs significant more growth to afford marketing programs to support his business. His real issue may be he is priced 30-40% higher than volume imports. <br/>  </li><p> The excuse that these are a function of being small and just starting out doesn&rsquo;t totally wash. I have another client who markets one of the same items as above. He sells direct, imports, and then prints blanks, has virtually no overhead or shipping costs, and has not even developed any internet effort .</p><p> However, focusing on word of mouth and low costs, in a few months he has built a $200,000 annualized business that returns 10-15% profits. We are helping him to manage his growth by helping to develop operational and marketing support.</p><p> <strong>  The message here is you must be competitive, and be aware of opportunities. Some suggestions include: </strong></p><li> Understand your competitor&rsquo;s total offer, including product, service, shipping, and warranties as well as you understand your own.</li><li> Research Google and Amazon (at least!) for price comparisons.</li><li> Costs and costing can be as important as pricing. Volume discounts, packaging sourcing, and direct shipping can all dramatically reduce costs and, thus, prices without affecting margins. <br/>  </li><p> In summary, be aware of the market place and don&rsquo;t let your ego believe you can charge any price for anything. You need to be profitable, but you also need to be competitive. And, your price needs to be justified, not in your own mind, but rooted in reality.

It can take willpower to doggedly continue to pursue new leads and maintain the hope of bringing the case to a conclusion. </strong></p><p> Whether I was sitting across from parents whose child had been abducted, elderly people who had been swindled out of their life savings, or a young executive coming to grips with the fact that her company was the victim of corporate espionage, I felt the full heft of responsibility as the lead investigator.</p><p> I was committed to these people, and I promised that I would do everything in my power to bring justice in each of their situations. The idea that I might fail them was scary.</p><p> You do not tell the parents of a missing child that the case is &ldquo;too hard,&rdquo; give up, and walk away. No&mdash;this is when you realize how willpower plays such a crucial role in mental toughness.</p><p> There are times when you simply must keep moving forward&mdash;family, career, and life depend upon it. Surrender is not an option.</p><p> Every day we are tempted to surrender and quit. It might be a cookie that is tempting us to stray from a diet, a warm bed in which to sleep late and miss work, or the feel of cool water on a beach instead of spending time strategizing our next career move&mdash;we all need willpower to decide the direction in which we will take our life.</p><p> Willpower is the ability to resist impulses with discipline and self-control. Researchers are discovering that willpower is a mental muscle, and certain physical and mental habits can weaken or strengthen our self-control.</p><p> <strong>  Here are 7 surprising ways you can increase your willpower: </strong></p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t Leave Home Without Your &ldquo;Why&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> To activate your willpower, you must remind yourself why something is important to you. If you are engaged in meaningless tasks or jobs, willpower will not save you.</p><p> When you have a purpose and are pursuing a goal that has meaning and value for you, your willpower can be tapped into because you are committed to something important to you.</p><h3> 2. Keep Front Sights On Your Goal, Not Your Fear</h3><p> <br/> When you focus on the goal, your concentration is channeled into a productive cycle of thinking. Instead of worrying, or becoming fearful, focus on planning how you will move toward your goal and overcome your obstacle.</p><p> Once you get your mind straight, and focused on your performance, options and plans of action become clearer.</p><h3> 3. Wrap Your Behavior Around Your Goal</h3><p> <br/> It is easier to muster the shot of energy you need if you define your goals as specific behavior. For example: if I my goal was pushups, I should specify a number, like &ldquo;35 good pushups&rdquo; rather than just &ldquo;do more of them.&rdquo; If it&rsquo;s a behavioral choice, the goal becomes a natural outgrowth.</p><p> Nordstrom is a great example of how a company can define its goal in terms of behavior: superior customer service. Sales and customer loyalty are the by-products of Nordstrom&rsquo;s behavior.</p><h3> 4. Good Habits Are The Magic Bullet</h3><p> <br/> Charles Duhigg explains in his book, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439056955&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+habit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Power of Habit  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; that habits cannot be eradicated; instead, they must be replaced. Habits are most malleable when we keep the same cue and the same reward.</p><p> If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine. You may need to change your environment to make sure what you should do is easy and what you shouldn&rsquo;t do is hard.</p><p> For example, perhaps you want to accomplish more first thing in the morning&mdash;study your habits to determine why you tend to feel groggy when you wake up. You may need to go to bed earlier, stop taking sleeping pills, or avoid alcohol in the evening.</p><p> For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. While belief is essential, it often only emerges with the help of a group&mdash;even a group of two people is large enough to change habits.</p><p> The best way to accomplish any change is by having a supportive group of friends around you.</p><h3> 5. Do The Hardest Thing First</h3><p> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve set your goal, it must become a priority. Wishing for something to happen won&rsquo;t make it happen. Reorganize your day so that you have time to make your goal a reality.</p><p> You have the greatest amount of mental energy in the morning.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The National Academy of Sciences  </a> </u>  reports that a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/newsroom/newsn/1659/how-extraneous-factors-impact-judicial-decisionmaking\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   survey of parole board judges  </a> </u>  determined that the judges were most likely to give a favorable ruling earlier in the morning. The odds of a favorable ruling plummeted right before lunch.</p><h3> 6. Master Your Mindset</h3><p> <br/> In the old days it was believed that willpower was a limited resource, or that it could be jumpstarted with a sugary drink. Failure of willpower over bulging waistlines and dead-end careers could be blamed on our biological limits.</p><p> This myth has been debunked by newer research. According to a study conducted by  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.pnas.org/?p=1183\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The National Academy of Sciences  </a> </u> , willpower can indeed be quite limited &mdash; but only if you believe it is!</p><p> When people believe that willpower is fixed and limited, their willpower is easily depleted. But when people believe that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/opinion/sunday/willpower-its-in-your-head.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   willpower is self-renewing  </a> </u>  &mdash; that when you work hard, you&rsquo;re energized to work more; that when you&rsquo;ve resisted one temptation, you can better resist the next one &mdash; then people successfully exert more willpower.</p><p> It turns out that willpower is in your head.</p><h3> 7. Be The Person Too Stupid To Quit</h3><p> <br/> There is a reason we admire people who have achieved long, happy marriages and overcome difficulties in life. Those individuals remain persistent even when it doesn&rsquo;t appear that success is guaranteed.</p><p> There is value in delayed gratification&mdash;some things are worth holding on to; the key is knowing which ones.</p><p> Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent&mdash;Calvin Coolidge</p><p> <strong>  How do you increase your willpower? </strong></p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-10 14:34:50.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-10 14:34:50.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_lkD0YVE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-surprising-ways-you-can-increase-your-willpower/\", \"post_id\": \"5313\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-10 14:34:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-10 14:34:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-surprising-ways-you-can-increase-your-willpower\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5312\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2402\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438978849647-a3503a63d760-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"577\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439322300,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2351,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Advisor's Job: Creating Transferable Business Value","link":"the-advisors-job-creating-transferable-business-value","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you are an attorney, CPA, banker, transaction intermediary or financial advisor, helping your clients build business value is likely far outside your professional expertise. <strong>  Yet, in our experience, the fundamental obstacle facing the owners all of us work with is transferable value. </strong></p><p> Business value becomes transferable when the current owner is no longer indispensable to the operation and well-being of the company.  A business with transferable value can be sold or transferred to another with minimal disruption to cash flow-even after the owner leaves the company.  The owner, in short, is dispensable.</p><p> Most owners are not able to exit their companies when they wish or with the financial independence they need because they are indispensable to cash flow and value creation.  Consequently, their businesses lack adequate transferable value.</p><p> They cannot sell or transfer their companies for enough cash to ensure their post-exit financial independence. So, no matter our area of professional expertise the challenge for us as owner advisors is: How can we help owners build transferable value in their companies?</p><p> As you consider this question, bear in mind two considerations: First, if you don't reach out to owners it is likely that no one else will. <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/advisors-job-creating-transferable-business-value#reference\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  1 </a>  Second, taking the lead role in helping owners develop greater value doesn't mean you need to turn into a valuation consultant. You need simply to understand the value creation process and recruit the proper consultants to develop value.</p><p> Ken A. Stiefler, a Certified Exit Planner and President of eXITSTM, LLC, agrees. \"When I meet owners I tell them that, in construction terminology, I'm like a general contractor, and that I depend on the expertise of my subcontractors. Over the years, I've developed a stable of skilled consultants so I can match the value-creation needs of an owner with the expertise of the consultant.\"</p><p> The approach Exit Planning advisors use to create value is, in turn, based on three considerations. First, they understand what buyers look for in targeting acquisitions. Buyers' value expectations are the most objective standards of valuing a company for transfer purposes.</p><p> Second, Exit Planning advisors share what we know about buyers with our owner clients.</p><p> Third, all advisors involved in the Exit Planning process must be prepared to represent their owner clients in enhancing and protecting value to the extent practical within each of our professional disciplines. There are many opportunities to do so during the planning and execution of each owner's Exit Plan. (We'll explore these opportunities in some depth in future articles.) These opportunities do not exist however, unless you show owners that they must create additional transferable value if they are to exit successfully.</p><h3> What owners need to know about building transferable value</h3><p> <br/> We suggest that the first task in helping owners to grow value is to communicate to them that transferable value is what a business is worth, to someone other than the owner, without the owner at the helm.  This rule applies no matter which exit path an owner chooses. Transferable value is the single, common determinant of a successful exit.</p><li> Insiders (co-owners or key employees) won't be willing (nor should owners be) to acquire a company by pledging personal assets if they can't run the business without the owner.</li><li> Passing on the business to the owner's kids is a recipe for disaster if it can't continue successfully without the parent.</li><li> Third-party buyers know that owners will leave the company when they sell so if the business is owner-dependent, what are they buying? That question is just rhetorical because buyers won't make offers on owner-dependent businesses. <br/>  </li><h3> Value Drivers</h3><p> <br/> Again, no matter what exit path an owner chooses, transferable value is the prime determinant of a successful exit. The factors (or business characteristics) that drive transferable value are \"value drivers.\"</p><p> Looked at from a buyer's perspective, strong value drivers are what make a company a desirable acquisition. When value drivers are present and functioning well, buyers will pay top dollar for them because they result in increased cash flow (and EBITDA). Generally speaking the greater the EBITDA the greater the multiple buyers will pay for the cash flow. For example, increasing cash flow from $1 million to $2 million also tends to increase the EBITDA multiple:</p><p>        $1 million x 4 = $ 4,000,000</p><p>        $2 million x 5 = $10,000,000</p><p>        But as hucksters say, \"That's not all, folks!\"</p><p> A company with strong value drivers will also tend to demand a higher multiple on the same amount of EBITDA than a company with average value drivers.</p><p> As you read through the list of value drivers below, remember that it contains only standard value drivers. Depending on what a company does, it may have other drivers that create and increase transferable value.</p><p> The listed value drivers are the ones that transaction intermediaries and private equity groups (professional buyers) tell us they use to assess business value.</p><p> <strong>  Standard value drivers include: </strong></p><li> Best-In-Class Management Team</li><li> Operating systems demonstrated to increase sustainability of cash flows</li><li> Diversified Customer Base</li><li> Proven Growth Strategy</li><li> Revenue that is recurring sustainable and resistant to \"commoditization\"</li><li> Good and Improving Cash Flow</li><li> Demonstrated Scalability</li><li> Competitive Advantage</li><li> Financial Foresight and Controls</li><p> Before we discuss these and many more characteristics of a company that build value and attract buyers, let's establish five working fundamentals.</p><h3> Fundamentals of Value Drivers</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  First, while it is the owner's job to create transferable value in the business prior to a sale </strong> , advisors and the owner's top management are invaluable as owners work to increase cash flow.</p><p> <strong>  Second, buyers&mdash;specifically Private Equity Groups (PEGs)&mdash;are the arbiters of value. </strong> That's important even to owners who may plan to transfer their businesses to insiders or sell to a strategic buyer. PEGs (generally financial buyers) are the gold standard because, unlike insiders, PEGs evaluate and set purchase prices for lower- and mid-market companies based on their experience, competition with other experienced buyers, and a thorough examination of a potential acquisition. PEGs are sophisticated buyers whose continued existence relies on making the right decisions, time after time, about the growth potential of companies. In short, they know what qualities to look for in acquisition candidates. These qualities are what we refer to as \"value drivers.\" Bringing these value drivers to the attention of the owner, and explaining their importance, is one of the first steps advisors can take to engage clients in any type of a value building process.</p><p> <strong>  Third, the sooner you help owners to improve their company's value drivers </strong> , the greater the potential to reap ongoing and future benefits for both owner and his or her company. Again, this principle applies whether owners plan to sell to a third party, transfer to insiders, or keep the business indefinitely.</p><p> <strong>  Fourth, if owners wait to begin building transferable value until they are emotionally prepared to leave the business: </strong></p><li> They will still have to do all the same work necessary to build value. That work will take just as much time as if they started today, but because they are already emotionally ready to leave, there's a high probability that they will have lost the passion and interest they have today. Once that happens and the entrepreneur is no longer a driving force, the energy and growth of the business suffers.</li><li> Owners who wait forfeit years of increased cash flow (as well as a more pleasant ownership experience), because the heart of value building is making the owner replaceable while increasing cash flow.</li><li> Owners who wait have fewer options when they exit than do owners who tackle building value well before their departures. Further, the obstacles they do encounter will be more difficult to overcome because you don't have the time to create and initiate alternative growth strategies, replacing non-performing management, etc. <br/>  </li><h3> Your job is to show owners that acting to drive value upward is vital and, since they have to do it anyway, why not start today?</h3><p> <br/> Finally, even if owners assume that their companies are too small to attract the notice of a PEG or strategic buyer, keep in mind that every buyer wants the same qualities in a business that professional buyers require.</p><p> For the reasons described here, we suggest that you strongly (and continually if need be!) encourage your clients to create an action plan to grow transferable value as part of their Exit Planning. If they do so it will (of course) create more work for you and other advisors. But the most important reason to urge owners to build value is that unless they do so, they will not be able to exit their companies when they wish or with the financial independence they need. Once owners understand the truth of this statement, you and your owner-client can begin, well in advance of an owner's planned departure date, to enhance value drivers and thereby increase transferable value.</p>References<br/>1. When we asked owners (in BEI's North American Business Owner Survey) who they had talked to, at least once, about their plans to exit their businesses, responses were: 22% to their spouses, 13% to their attorneys 12% to their CPAs 9% to their children 9% to their financial advisors, and 3% to their insurance advisors.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-10 14:22:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-10 14:22:47.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_0oaLnLN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-advisors-job-creating-transferable-business-value/\", \"post_id\": \"5311\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-10 14:22:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-10 14:22:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-advisors-job-creating-transferable-business-value\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5310\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2401\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439194850785-37cfb3d7efc2.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"639\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439290800,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2350,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Being Victimized by a Predatory Wealth Adviser?","link":"are-you-being-victimized-by-a-predatory-wealth-adviser","source_link":null,"content":"<p> While predatory lenders capture the headlines, there are other predatory wealth advisers. While Bernie Madoff comes to mind, there are many others that don&rsquo;t make the headlines. Unfortunately, there is no profile of a predatory wealth adviser. The Certified Financial Planner Board recently did an experiment showing how a clean looking, knowledgeable sounding person can fool the unsuspecting consumer. 1 I believe it&rsquo;s key to know what kind of financial advisor you are working with, their regulatory record and what the designations they have actually mean.</p><h3> What does wealth adviser/financial advisor/financial planner mean?</h3><p> <br/> The term wealth adviser/financial advisor/financial planner can mean lots of things. I find that many people associate with people who are registered (licensed) to transact investments. Insurance agents, financial advisors, CPAs and others may also refer to themselves as financial advisors. If someone says they are a financial advisor, you should ask them what kind of advisor are they. If they are involved with investments, they either sell securities and are regulated by FINRA or advice on them and are regulated by the Securities Exchange Commission. Securities salespeople are often referred to as brokers and do not have to buy/sell keeping your interest ahead of theirs. They receive commissions. It is legal for them to sell you the highest commission product if a similar product exists with a lower commission.</p><p> In contrast, an investment advisor representative who works for a Registered Investment Advisor must keep your interests ahead of their own. They are paid a transparent fee for their advice. Any incentives they may receive which could lead to a conflict of interest are to be disclosed verbally or in writing to you.</p><h3> No need to check the regulatory record. They work for a name brand firm</h3><p> <br/> Many people find by selecting a well-known firm that will protect them from a rogue advisor. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s the all too frequent expos&eacute; where you find the companies you expected to do a background check on their employees actually had not. Sometimes they have and choose to hire someone for their ability to attract new business rather than their clean regulatory record. There are some high profile cases where people with questionable regulatory records or some who have been fired from firms for not for working against the client&rsquo;s interests have found a new home working for a well brand a well-known brand name firm.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t you want the confidence that comes with knowing that you have worked with someone that is not only knowledgeable it also has a clean regulatory background? The industry often quotes size of assets. Many who hear size assume that more is better and that somehow that indicates performance. McDonald&rsquo;s used to advertise how many billions they had served. They didn&rsquo;t say that each one of those people was happy or received healthy food.</p><h3> Wealth adviser designations and certifications</h3><p> <br/> I believe it&rsquo;s key to understand or to know the certifications that the adviser you are working with has. You should also know if they are required to work solely in your best interest or if they can work in the best interest of their firm. You should also know if there regulatory record is clean. While the choice should be up to you to make, at least you should know the details. If you&rsquo;d like for us to help we are here. Make sure that you are practicing self-defense.</p><h3> Financial self-defense for seniors</h3><p> <br/> I recently did a presentation on Financial Self-Defense for Seniors  2  at a continuing care retirement community. I asked these seniors when they heard the word &ldquo;certified&rdquo; what they thought. A couple of the answers: &ldquo;were trained&rdquo;, &ldquo;had the training&rdquo; and &ldquo;was a professional.&rdquo; I shared some of the tools in this blog. No one seemed to have heard of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or understood that the SEC had tools to help them. It&rsquo;s difficult to defend yourself when you don&rsquo;t even know the functions and the resources available to you to vet advisors that may be a predator. Below I provide some of tools to help you and your loved ones research financial professionals.</p><h3> 5 tools to help weed out predatory wealth advisers</h3><p> <br/> There are several tools to help learn more about your current advisor or any that you are considering. You should likely make this an annual check as records can change.</p><li> Research broker regulatory records at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.finra.org/brokercheck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BrokerCheck  </a> </u></li><li> Investment adviser reps are overseen by the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/IapdMain/iapd_SiteMap.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">   Investment Advisor Public Disclosure  </a> </u>  (SEC) or a state securities regulator.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.finra.org/investors/professional-designations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Professional Designations  </a> </u>  are categorized, not endorsed, by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.finra.org/investors/professional-designations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  </a> </u>  (FINRA).

{"original_id":2348,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Is Inertia and What It Means for Content","link":"what-is-inertia-and-what-it-means-for-content","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The legendary scientist Richard Feynman, does a great job of explaining inertia in  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjm8JeDKvdc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this video  </a> </u> . He offers the insight and clarity that only Feynman brings to such a complicated concept.  What does inertia have to do with  <u>  content </u>  marketing? We&rsquo;ll everything!!!  When you create a  <u>  content marketing </u>  plan you have to keep producing great content along your brand journey.  Inertia keeps that journey going, but it can also keep you going when you should turn left.</p><p> In the video linked above, Feynman discusses the idea that things that are moving try to keep on moving. Things that are still try to remain still. Once you get your content  <u>  marketing </u>  moving, keep it that way with regular updates and little nudges to enhance your content. When you&rsquo;ve identified a goal like lead generation, or building authority, feeding the content library designed to accomplish those tasks will get you closer and closer. Eventually it becomes easier. You can reference something you created the week or month before. You become more credible when you&rsquo;ve got a library of thought leadership supporting your point of view.</p><h3> The Hardest Part is Getting Started</h3><p> <br/> Starting your content marketing effort takes a big push, but keeping it going requires less energy. Once you start pouring out great content, it&rsquo;s easy to keep the content ball rolling once you see what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.  What about inertia that keeps you moving when you should stop?</p><p> When you&rsquo;ve planned out your  <u>  content marketing strategy </u> , outlined where content will come from, and built some habits, those habits can continue carrying you in a direction after you should have turned. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to measure your progress and confirm you&rsquo;re heading in the right direction. Once you&rsquo;ve got your whole organization chugging along, you&rsquo;re going to have to put in some efforts to change their heading.</p><h3> How Not To Get Pulled in The Wrong Direction</h3><p> <br/> To avoid your inertia taking you in the wrong direction, pay attention to where you&rsquo;re going and what your reporting tells you. Making small course corrections can save a marketing campaign before it goes completely off the rails. If it falls apart, you&rsquo;ll have to expend all kinds of energy to get it going again, and then you&rsquo;re back to the idea that things that are still try to remain still.</p><p> At first glance, the connection between physics and content marketing may seem tenuous. Give it a second look and think about the nudges you give your marketing efforts. The little nudges add up to big momentum; make sure you&rsquo;re rolling in the right direction.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-08 23:06:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-08 23:06:20.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_zIHATKN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-is-inertia-and-what-it-means-for-content/\", \"post_id\": \"5305\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-08 23:06:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-08 23:06:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-is-inertia-and-what-it-means-for-content\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5304\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2397\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-08-at-4.04.15-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"414\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439233200,"author_id":271,"chart_url":""}

It is also the hormone that controls our empathy, morality and connection.</p><p> <strong>  Rule of Thumb: The more you feel connected to someone, the more oxytocin you have pumping in your body. </strong></p><h3> #2: Oxytocin Pays</h3><p> <br/> Having more oxytocin has tons of benefits. Researchers found that when people are given a nasal spray of the hormone oxytocin, they behave in ways that are kinder, more compassionate, cooperative and generous.</p><li> You connect with people faster</li><li> Your relationships are stronger</li><li> You earn more money</li><p> <br/> Let me dig into this last one a bit more. Zak carried out an experiment called the Trust Game. In this ultimatum game, one of two people is given a sum of money and told she must decide how to split it with person No. 2. If person No. 2 is dissatisfied with the split, then she can reject it, but then the money vanishes, and neither person gets any. Zak found that participants with higher oxytocin levels shared and then earned more money than low oxytocin players. When researchers gave some participants a squirt of oxytocin beforehand, their offers increased by 80%. In other words, trust is a better way to approach a deal than competitiveness.</p><p> This is reflected in country data as well--in economies with more trust, there is higher GDP.</p><p> \"Being able to rely on others to deliver what they promise and not cheat or steal, is a more powerful factor in a country's economic development than education, access to resources--anything.\" -Zak</p><h3> #3: Oxytocin Loves</h3><p> <br/> Oxytocin is how we bond and build loving relationships. Oxytocin can deepen all kinds of relationships in your life:</p><li> You can be a better parent</li><li> You can be a better friend</li><li> You can be a better lover</li><p> In a set of terrifying experiments on animals, researchers inhibited the oxytocin levels in mothers and found that those mothers then shunned their offspring. On the other hand, when mothers were given higher oxytocin levels, they were better at nurturing their young AND began to nurture other mother's offspring as well. This is why nursing dogs occasionally adopt orphaned kittens:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-08-at-3.33.31-PM.png\" width=\"846\"/></p><p> click to view</p><p> Why is oxytocin so important for love and relationships? Zak argues that displays of generosity is the number one rule for courtship in human societies.</p><p> \"Who wants a mate who's going to be selfish and self-interested?\" - Zak</p><p> So, we produce oxytocin in a healthy relationship to make us more compassionate AND we look for people with high oxytocin when searching for a good relationship.</p><h3> #4: Why We Commit</h3><p> <br/> Researchers have done lots of experiments on prairie voles -- they tend to have monogamous relationships like humans. Researchers wanted to see if they could tempt prairie vole husbands.</p><li> Researchers took virgin male meadow voles--the ones who are loners and playboys and injected them with oxytocin</li><li> Then, they paraded the playboy male voles in front of a line of attractive, single female prairie voles.</li><li> After the voles had sex with their choice, instead of running off to another vole, the male stayed to cuddle and nest with that same female over and over again (even when presented with other perfectly attractive female voles at the ready).</li><p> <br/> Yes, you read that right. Oxytocin made them want to cuddle.</p><p> This suggests that oxytocin might be a major factor in a man (or woman's) desire to nest -- and be monogamous.</p><p> <strong>  Special Note: Oxytocin is nicknamed the cuddle hormone. To test this out, I did this cuddle experiment: </strong></p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KAu8aWeiOiU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-08-at-3.35.47-PM.png\" width=\"849\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> Interesting Fact: Oxytocin surges for everyone after a wedding! Zak took blood from all guests at a wedding ( <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1261236/Our-happy-hormone-wedding-How-levels-love-hormone-oxytocin-ceremony--intriguing-results.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  yes, really! </a> ) and found that happiness for the couple causes an oxytocin bonanza. Even more crazy--you can predict how much oxytocin is released based on the person's closeness to the bride!</p><h3> #5: Why You're Lonely</h3><p> <br/> Could your oxytocin levels change your social behavior? Specifically:</p><p> Are you a loner?</p><li> Researchers created a \"knockout mouse\" where they removed the gene for oxytocin from the mouse's genetic code.</li><li> This mouse suddenly produced zero oxytocin and subsequently developed social amnesia. He couldn't recognize other mice who'd been longtime pals and he became a loners in his cage.</li><li> When researchers injected this mouse with oxytocin, the social amnesia disappeared!</li><p> <br/> If you feel anti-social or have a hard time connecting, there could be a chemical explanation. Some research has even found a link between  <a href=\"https://sfari.org/funding/grants/abstracts/oxytocin-biology-and-the-social-deficits-of-autism-spectrum-disorders\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   oxytocin levels and autism  </u>  . </a></p><p> Special Note: One of the studies I found fascinating in the book had to do with childhood trauma. People who have experienced trauma as a child, have lower oxytocin levels and have lower oxytocin responses. Trauma somehow inhibits our feelings of empathy. This is easily understood: If someone was abused, their brain and body learns that people can't be trusted and therefore shuts down production of the trust hormone. This is why victims of abuse have a very hard time connecting with people and might be avoidant of future relationships. This might even be the cause of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120070/\" target=\"_blank\">   Oxytocin Deficit Disorder  </a> </u> . Their body is trying to learn from the past.</p><h3> #6: Women Are Nicer Than Men</h3><p> <br/> ... at least in the Trust Game. The average amount returned by a male player in the trust game was 25%. The average returned by a female player was 42%! On the extremes, 30% of the men returned less than 10% (pretty skimpy), but only 13% of the women were that coldhearted. The ultimate snub: 24% of the men returned absolutely nothing (took everything for themselves), while only 7% of women did so. Researchers believe this has to do with a man's testosterone which is an oxytocin blocker.</p><p> \"The higher the testosterone, the more the oxytocin response is blocked, the less empathy a person experiences. The less empathy a person experiences, the less generosity they have.\" -Zak</p><p> A possible explanation for this could be that when male cavemen were hunting for food they had to have more testosterone to help them on the hunt. They had to have less empathy to kill and skin their prey to feed their family back in the cave.</p><li> It's Not All Women: Zak was able to test Stephanie Castagnier, known as \"the goddess of greed\" on the Apprentice. Castagnier watched a heart-wrenching video depicting a child dying of cancer. While this made most participants oxytocin levels surge by 47%, Castagnier's oxytocin increased only 9%. Castagnier came from a traumatic childhood--her father was a high-rolling drug dealer and became a homeless junkie when she was young. Before she had finished high school, both of her parents had died of AIDS. See note on trauma above--this tends to inhibit natural oxytocin responses. <br/>  </li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-08-at-3.47.10-PM.png\" width=\"392\"/></p><p> Let's get back to the men. I'm going to put it all out there with this scary fact:</p><p> \"High-testosterone males divorce more often, spend less time with their children, engage in competitions of all types, have more sexual partners (as well as learning disabilities) and lose their jobs more often.\" -Zak</p><p> <strong>  Wowser. I was happy to direct quote Zak on that because that research is a doozy. But don't worry, there are ways to produce more oxytocin than your natural baseline: </strong></p><h3> #7: Oxytocin Triggers</h3><p> <br/> Since we now know that oxytocin helps us earn more money and more love, let's talk about what triggers oxytocin.</p><p> Not all of us can get oxytocin nasal sprays for our friends and family = )</p><li> Emotional Videos: Even watching emotional or heart warming clips can increase your oxytocin--47% on average over people's baseline according to Zak!</li><li> Touch: Handshakes, fist bumps, high fives, hugs--they all produce oxytocin. Never skip a handshake, because that initial touch upon greeting sets you up for a stronger connection as your oxtocin begins to pump.</li><li> Tweeting: Sometimes connection can happen in the digital world too. Zak did a rather unscientific study with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/1767125/digital-oxytocin-how-trust-keeps-facebook-twitter-humming\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fast Company writer Adam Penenberg  </a> </u>  and found that after tweeting, his oxytocin increased by 13%! I want to make a special note here: I think this only works if you truly feel you are building relationships and connecting with followers.</li><li> Dancing: Zak did a study with swing dancers and found that after busting some moves, oxytocin levels raised on average (across age and genders) by 11%! Interestingly, Zak found that those who were more central to the social group of dancers had higher production of oxytocin.</li><li> Eye Contact: Mutual gazing is another way to increase oxytocin, which is one of the reasons eye contact is so important during networking.</li><li> Massage: Researchers found that players in the Trust Game who were given massages, had a 9% increase in their oxytocin levels immediately and were willing to give 243% more!</li><li> Laughter: Oxytocin is a very happy chemical. When you laugh with someone, your body triggers all kinds of bonding responses. <br/>  </li><h3> #8: Superhuman People Powers</h3><p> <br/> Oxytocin makes you better at reading people and helps us interpret what others are thinking--the ultimate mind-reading super power.  <u>  <a href=\"http://dericbownds.net/uploaded_images/MindReading.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   In one study  </a> </u> , participants given oxytocin were better at interpreting subtle social cues from the eyes and guessing what the person in a photograph might be thinking or feeling at that moment, compared to participants given a placebo.</p><p> The better your people skills, the more oxytocin you produce and the deeper your connections are. In a big way, oxytocin is the entire reason I run this website. I want you to feel connected to the people around you, have deep meaningful relationships and be memorable to people around you.</p><p> When you deepen your relationships, you produce more oxytocin.</p><p> Learning how to interact with people is the ultimate oxytocin producer.</p><h3> #9: The Virtuous Cycle</h3><p> <br/> \"Oxytocin generates the empathy that drives moral behavior, which inspires trust, which causes the release of more oxytocin, which creates more empathy. This is the behavioral feedback loop we call the virtuous cycle.\" -Zak</p><p> We are human because we care. If you see someone in distress, your brain releases oxytocin so you can help. We can't survive without fellow humans, and we have adapted to encourage connection, survival and strong support systems. This is why we are driven to help those around us--in the short term it benefits them, and in the longterm it benefits us all.</p><p> Bottom line: Nice guys finish first.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-08 22:41:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-08 22:41:09.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_cCZ5MVV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-science-of-trust/\", \"post_id\": \"5303\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-08 22:41:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-08 22:41:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-science-of-trust\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5298\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2396\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-08-at-3.49.02-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1023\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439208000,"author_id":498,"chart_url":""}

To some, this made Germany a bright spot in an otherwise anemic Eurozone economy &mdash; a &ldquo;growth driver,&rdquo; as the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, puts it. In fact, Germany&rsquo;s chronic trade surpluses lie at the heart of Europe&rsquo;s problems; far from boosting the global economy, they are dragging it down. The best way to end this perverse situation is for Germany to leave the Eurozone.&rdquo;</p><h3> So could Germany leave the Eurozone and, more importantly, what would it mean if they did?</h3><p> <br/> This is not a new idea, and has been floated by many thinkers for some time.  Perhaps the most important contribution to the recent debate on the matter came from George Soros in 2012.  In an interview with  <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/george-soros-says-germany-must-change-course-on-euro-crisis-a-841061.html#ref=rss?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Spiegel Online  </u>    </a> in June 2012, this exchange sums up why Greece has some rightly pushback on the German plan:</p><p> SPIEGEL ONLINE: Germans remember the birth of the euro very differently. They felt they had to give up the deutschmark in order to get other European Union nations to agree to German reunification.</p><p> Soros: True. The integration of Europe was very much led by a Germany that was always willing to pay a little bit extra to reach a compromise that everybody accepted, because Germany was so eager to get European support for reunification. That was called the \"farsighted vision,\" which created the European Union.</p><p> SPIEGEL ONLINE: Do we need a similar vision today?</p><p> Soros: I want to draw the parallel between what is happening with the euro zone right now, and what happened after World War II, when the Bretton Woods system of monetary management was created to govern the global economy. Then, America became the center of this system, and the dollar became the dominant global currency. It was a free world dominated by America. But America earned that position by providing huge funds for the reconstruction of Europe through the Marshall Plan. America became a benevolent imperial power, which greatly benefited America.</p><p> SPIEGEL ONLINE: How can that situation be compared to the one in which we find ourselves today?</p><p> Soros: Germany is in a similar position today, but it is not willing to engage in anything like the Marshall Plan. It is opposed to any transfer union for the rest of Europe.</p><p> SPIEGEL ONLINE: The Marshall Plan, though significant, amounted to just a small share of the US gross domestic product. The potential payouts related to a euro rescue program, on the other hand, might be more than Germany can handle.</p><p> Soros: Nonsense. The more comprehensive and convincing a debt reduction program is, the less likely it is to fail. And remember, just as Germany is grateful to America for the Marshall Plan, Italy would be grateful to Germany for helping it lower its refinancing costs. If it did that, Germany could set the conditions. And Italy would be happy to meet those conditions, because it would benefit from it. Not to recognize this opportunity is a tragic, historical mistake by the Germans.</p><p> However, to portray a Gerxit rather the a Grexit is not a balanced discussion unless you include the alternate view, and there always is one.  Professors Iain Begg and John Ryan of the London School of Economics call the idea of a German exit a disaster:</p><p> \"After European Union membership, I think the construction of the euro is one of the greatest achievements that Germany has been able to achieve post-war.  From a political point of view, there's been a lot of capital put into the project. Going out of the euro would maybe send a bad message for the sustainability of the EU as well.  And Germany leaving the euro would just send an absolutely crashing message, and it's not conceivable to think that the Eurozone could really survive after that.\"</p><p> Either way, the final solution to Greece&rsquo;s unsustainable debt problem is still unworkable.  From this morning&rsquo;s Sydney Morning Herald,   <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/greek-bailout-greeces-banks-are-dying-and-fast-20150806-gitmxr.html#ixzz3i7BmD2z2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Greece's banks are dying, and fast  </u>  : </a></p><p> &ldquo;Greece's purchasing managers index, which measures manufacturing activity, just collapsed from a sickly 46.9 to a deathly 30.2. Anything less than 50 means that the manufacturing sector is shrinking.</p><p> That, in turn, means that Greek businesses that should have been able to pay back what they owed won't be able to do so. And so the Greek banks that lent them money - which, at the time, was a perfectly reasonable thing to do - are in line for more loss. How much more? Well, enough that their stocks have fallen by the maximum 30 per cent almost every day since the country's markets reopened. Add it all up, and Greece's four biggest banks have plunged between 80 and 90 per cent since last October. At this rate, it won't be long until they need the &euro;10 billion to &euro;25 billion bailout that Greece's creditors think it will take to recapitalise them.&rdquo;</p><p> So maybe Germany will have to leave the Eurozone to keep the zone sustainable, or maybe Greece will leave by default &ndash; further default &ndash; and its economy will be in ruins for years to come.</p><p> A map of the Eurozone, based upon credit ratings today by  <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/this-map-shows-europes-colossal-debt-division-2015-8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Fitch </a> :</p><br /><p>  </p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-08 22:13:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-08 22:13:58.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_cPm7PpJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-new-debate-should-germany-leave-the-eurozone/\", \"post_id\": \"5297\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-08 22:13:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-08 22:13:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-new-debate-should-germany-leave-the-eurozone\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5296\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2395\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-08-at-3.19.10-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"381\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439218800,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

He told us: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re promoting three inclusive behaviors&mdash;one is active listening.&rdquo; Active listening involves some very specific behaviors. &ldquo;So, when we listen to our associates, we&rsquo;ve got to stop doing anything else. We need to give this moment to who we are listening to and pay attention.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a skill that may sound simple but give it a try. You&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s not simple. But it is a powerful way to convey inclusion to employees. In addition, Fan says, Walmart is working actively to draw out its quieter employees. &ldquo;A lot of times our quiet associates have a point of view but they may not feel comfortable to speak up and share. As a leader you need to probe, ask questions and mine their points of view. Our 2.1 million associates across the world are our competitive advantage. We don&rsquo;t want to omit one unique perspective or one creative idea.&rdquo;</p><p> Having a wide, and diverse, range of inputs helps to ensure that you are not inadvertently overlooking key issues that impact your organization and its success.</p><h3> Inclusive leaders listen--to everyone!

She was doing interesting work with people she liked and didn&rsquo;t have a lot to complain about most days.  Even when a  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/eye-to-eye-with-the-new-boss/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   new leadership team was brought in  </a> </u>  and she was feeling the pinch of their new direction, she continued to be focused on doing good work up until the day she was fired.  </p><p> There are far too many people who will deeply understand Sue&rsquo;s shock and frustration based on their own similar, challenging and unexpected experience.However, this isn&rsquo;t really Sue&rsquo;s story.  It&rsquo;s really about those that remained and felt the shockwaves hit the already tenuous organizational culture head on. </p><p> Back at the office, word started to spread among the other consultants and employees about Sue&rsquo;s firing.  Information and reassurances about their positions didn&rsquo;t come from the top and as a result, fear and misinformation quickly spread, like a cancer from an unknown source, and moved through the rumor mill like lightning.  </p><p> Fear began to rule the day as everyone began to wait.  They were waiting for someone to acknowledge that this human being, that was more than a seat warmer for nearly a decade, had disappeared.  Unfortunately, the wait was never-ending and eventually  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/personal-leadership-thrive-in-ambiguity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   people needed to refocus and mask their worry  </a> </u>  that they&rsquo;d be tapped on the shoulder next.  That place, where they all gathered to do great work and make a difference, was now a fear factory. </p><p> I&rsquo;m not going to debate if it was &ldquo;fair&rdquo; the Sue was fired, but instead wonder how could she have been fired without a major blow to the organizational culture?</p><h3> Communication and the Rumor Mill</h3><p> <br/> On the day that Sue came in to collect her things, everyone quietly watched and wondered what was happening.  There were hushed voices whispering everywhere, but no one with authority was in the mix.  The front line was in disarray while the leadership team ignored their growing concern.  Days turned into weeks and it was as if a giant eraser had come out of the sky and inexplicably erased any trace of Sue&rsquo;s presence. The team tried to pretend that it was  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/getting-back-to-business-as-usual/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business as usual  </a> </u> , but the rumor mill was still going strong.  </p><h3> When are Leaders Needed Most?  What if&hellip; <br/>  </h3><li> The leadership team  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/how-to-move-forward-face-fear/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   acknowledged the fear  </a> </u> ?</li><li> The leadership team helped people to refocus on the mission?</li><li> The leadership team touched base with people to coach, mentor and support their continued success?</li><li> The leadership team shared that it was not the tip of an iceberg of layoffs, but a one-off unique circumstance? <br/>  </li><p> Of course, none of that happened, but the rest of the story is not a huge surprise either. Sue moved on to a new position with a new company and the fear factory settled into a new status quo filled with doubt, eggshells and disengagement.</p><h3> In the New Reality: <br/>  </h3><li> Morale dropped to an all-time low.</li><li> Top talent began to think about leaving.</li><li> New talent was reluctant to join the organization once the rumor mill spread into the larger community.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/innovation-failure-transformation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Innovation was stifled  </a> </u>  because it would mean the risk of failure, ridicule or worse, job loss. <br/>  </li><h3> A positive, productive and powerful organizational culture takes time and intention to build, but can be trashed in a moment.  </h3><p> <br/> When Sue was fired, the status quo shifted and it&rsquo;s as if the entire team shuffled three steps to the left. Ultimately, it would seem that firing Sue was a message to the rest of the team of consultants and employees: &ldquo;Stay in line or it&rsquo;s time to go.&rdquo;  Harsh, no matter how you hear it, but this time, instead of a tough all-hands meeting, the message was sent through a game of whisper-down-the-lane with no control or appreciation for how the message landed. </p><p> <strong>  Is it too late to get back on track?

{"original_id":2343,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Six Reasons Why Your Employees Don't Believe a Word You Say","link":"six-reasons-why-your-employees-dont-believe-a-word-you-say","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Doug Dickerson and Elizabeth Stincelli</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe what I say. Believe what I do.&rdquo; &mdash;Carlson Ghosn </strong></p><p> Two psychiatrists meet at their 20th college reunion. One is vibrant, while the other looks withered and worried. \"So what's your secret?\" the older looking psychiatrist asks. \"Listening to other people's problems every day, all day long, for years on end, has made an old man of me.\" \"So,\" replies the younger looking one, \"who listens?\"</p><p> That humorous story reminds us as leaders of not just the necessity of listening but of the importance of how we communicate. It&rsquo;s not so much what we say that&rsquo;s important but that we are leaders who understand why our people should listen to us in the first place.</p><p> If your people are tuning you out and not believing what you say then your leadership is on life-support. Knowing the symptoms is the first step in turning things around. If your people don&rsquo;t believe a word you say then here are six reasons why.</p><h3> You are self-centered</h3><p> <br/> If you are a self-centered leader your people will not believe you because you are only looking out for yourself. When decisions are made based upon what is best for you &ndash;what makes you look good- then you are using your people. Self-centered leadership tends to be manipulative and puts what is best for you above what is best for the team. If you are a self-centered leader you&rsquo;d better wake up before it&rsquo;s too late. One day you will look around and you&rsquo;ll discover that not only are your people not believing you &ndash; they are not following you either.</p><h3> You are inconsistent</h3><p> <br/> Inconsistent actions produce inconsistent results. The flow and continuity of your leadership is essential to your success. If you say one thing and do another then those very actions will lead to mistrust and will marginalize your leadership. Flexibility is a must for any team moving forward. Unexpected things happen and your people will have to learn to go with the flow. But if you are inconsistent in terms of what you communicate or how you treat them it will be impossible for them to move forward or have faith in your leadership.</p><h3> You don't have their backs</h3><p> <br/> Nothing will empower your team faster than having the backs of your people. A good leader knows this. But your people will not believe you if your message to them says &ldquo;I have your back&rdquo; yet you are nowhere to be found when they need you. When you empower your people and have their backs you create a momentum that can take your team to new levels of success. Don&rsquo;t squander the drive, motivation, and ingenuity of your people by failing at this one critical element of your leadership. If you have the backs of your people they will have yours.</p><h3> Your ego is front and center</h3><p> <br/> If, as a leader, your ego is front and center, your employees won&rsquo;t believe a word you say. Your ego can prevent you from seeing the world as it really is; you begin interpreting reality through your own biased lens. When your ego is front and center you send the message that your opinion is the only one that matters. Soon your employees, tired of hearing about how you know everything, will stop listening to you at all.</p><h3> You lead with fear</h3><p> <br/> If you lead with fear you will never earn the trust of your employees and they won&rsquo;t believe a word you say. Fear stimulates the fight or flight response. In this state of mind, there is no higher-level cognitive thinking. When you lead with fear your employees disengage and become more focused on protecting themselves than what you are saying. Your attempt to control your employee&rsquo;s behavior through fear will result in distrust and will undermine your ability to share your message and vision.</p><h3> They don't feel valued</h3><p> <br/> Our success is deeply intertwined with our ability to collaborate. When your employees don&rsquo;t feel valued they lose interest in continuing to try to contribute to the team. They withdraw and you lose the value of their unique skills and knowledge. Your employees need to have a voice and to have their individual contributions recognized and valued. Communication is a two-way street and when your employees don&rsquo;t feel valued, you lose their respect which has a negative impact your ability to communicate and influence as a leader. When your employees don&rsquo;t feel valued they won&rsquo;t believe a word you say.</p><p> The key to leadership is trust and influence. If your people don&rsquo;t believe a word you say, you have lost your ability to lead. It&rsquo;s time to evaluate your leadership. <strong>  Is your leadership self-centered or inconsistent? Do you have your employee&rsquo;s backs? Is your ego front and center? Are you leading with fear? Do your people feel valued? Answer these questions honestly, make a change, and start leading today. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-07 22:07:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-07 22:07:08.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_unyr6Je.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/six-reasons-why-your-employees-dont-believe-a-word-you-say/\", \"post_id\": \"5291\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-07 22:07:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-07 22:07:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"six-reasons-why-your-employees-dont-believe-a-word-you-say\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5290\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2392\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-08-at-3.57.43-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"687\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439229600,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

It identified their target market and described what was unique about how they approached financial advice. It was clear. It was different. I thought it was compelling. And <strong>  the next step before we used it as a basis for their communication strategy was to test it with a few clients to see if it needed any refinements before we moved forward. </strong> Were they surprised by what they heard!The clients let them know that what they saw as the most valuable aspect of the services they provided was not what they considered most valuable. More important, they let the Advisor know that the way the statement characterized them was a real turn off. Even a little condescending.By the way, part of what they found demeaning was the claim that they &ldquo;educated their clients&rdquo; and \"take financial issues off their hands.\"</p><h3> Those are a phrases I have heard from quite a few advisors.</h3>If you are in the habit of saying that, I would encourage you to get some feedback from some of your clients like they did. It may be that your clients appreciate the educational component of your service. It could also be, however, that your clients react like their&rsquo;s did. Their clients let them know that they come to them for advice, not an education. I had not really thought about it this way, but it makes sense. I don&rsquo;t go to my doctor or my lawyer to be educated. I want them to advise me. Similarly, telling people they can simply \"delegate their financial tasks\" to you is self-serving. Many clients want to delegate things to you so they don't have to do them and recognize your expertise (in investment management, anyway). But saying to clients \"you don't have to worry about how your money is managed, just send it to us\" can come off badly with clients. It did in their case, anyway. The clients indicated there was nothing compelling about that as a proposition. You won&rsquo;t know how your clients respond to that message until you ask.Could you imagine the marketing quagmire the advisor would have gotten into had we moved forward with the original positioning statement? They would have been promoting a message that actually turned some of their ideal prospects away.<h3> Instead of attracting target clients, they would have been repelling them.</h3>This kind of experience is not that unusual. In working with Emerson Investment Management of Boston, we pulled together there top advisors and drafted a positioning statement that emphasized three points they considered to be core to what made them valuable and different. When we brought it to their client advisory board, the reaction was &ldquo;meh.&rdquo; So we got some additional feedback from them and went back to the drawing board. They had a similar experience<h3> You can find value in testing almost any aspect of your marketing with your clients.</h3>Ask your client advisory board to critique your website. Find out what parts interest them and which do not add value. And be prepared for them to tell you it&rsquo;s awful. I have heard that come out in a few advisory boards. (And, in fairness, the advisors generally had reached that conclusion before they asked for the feedback.) Do you believe that the pictures of senior citizens enjoying their happy retirement help prospective clients imagine themselves in that scenario, assisted by your excellent advice? Don&rsquo;t bank on it. One of the best comments I ever heard in any advisory board was from a client of a firm in Connecticut. His feedback about the &ldquo;happy retiree&rdquo; pictures on their website was &ldquo;we are tired of the Cialis ads.&rdquo;<strong> One firm discovered that its staff profile page was one of the most popular among clients.</strong>They found it more interesting and valuable than their services page or even their homepage. Whether that means emphasizing the staff pages or redesigning the home and service pages is up for discussion.<h3> If you send out client newsletters, ask your advisory board to dissect them.</h3>What parts do they find most valuable? Which do they find least valuable? What articles are the most likely reason they would pass it along to their friends? When we ask clients to rank the different parts of a newsletter from most valuable to least valuable, from what they read the most closely to what they skip over, can you guess what they read most closely? It is commonly an update on what&rsquo;s going on in your office &ndash; staff changes, who is having kids, events in the lives of the people there.<strong> And what consistently ranks lowest? Market review and commentary.</strong>What might you do differently if you knew that&rsquo;s how your clients felt?<strong> Testing messages with clients helps you accomplish a few valuable things:</strong><li> You discover which messages connect and which messages fall flat.</li><li> Sometimes clients can correct or clarify your message. You might hear things like &ldquo;let me tell you what I find really valuable.&rdquo;</li><li> As you refine your language, you simultaneously teach your clients what you want them to say to refer you.</li><li> You remind them about some of the valuable things you offer that they might have forgotten.</li><li> You help jog their memory of any friends they may have spoken to recently who need what you do.</li><li> You engage them with your practice. They feel better connected and have a little ownership in your strategy. And engaged clients refer.</li>If you are creating or updating your message, test it out with a few clients.

She described the dark day when she was handed an envelope and told that, after some three decades, her services were no longer required. I have witnessed some who broke a lot of glass on the way out, while others were more restrained and measured.</p><p> Scientifically, inflection is described as a turning: a bend, or a curve. In business, and in personal life, this term is used to describe a time of significant change&mdash;a turning point.</p><h3> Turning points come in many forms; some chosen, some imposed.</h3><p> <br/> Turning points can occur in the form of turning back when we realize that we&rsquo;re on the wrong path, and need to get back to the place where the decision was made so that we can choose a new path. In my own experience these &lsquo;wrong-path&rsquo; realizations usually occur around two a.m.!</p><h3> In leadership, we are frequently called upon to be a change agent.</h3><p> <br/> I have said quite often that leadership is about change, and change brings about violence, either in the form of an inward struggle to cope with change, or sometimes an outward violence that seeks to halt, or reverse, the change you are seeking to bring about (for a colourful example from British history, read up on the story of the Luddites).</p><p> These moments can be not only searing experiences for us, but they can also require what is perhaps a key cognitive discipline upon which self-awareness grows. That discipline is self-regulation. In simple language, I have heard this summed up in the expression leadership means giving up the right to be selfish. Whichever way you like to think of it, I offer that self-regulation is a critical trait for change leadership&mdash;when we are leading change, and when we are on the receiving end of change. Others are watching us closely. Our language, demeanour, tone and cadence are all outward manifestations of our inner self-regulation and reflection&mdash;yes, even when we&rsquo;re driving at the speed limit and someone else is riding our rear bumper!</p><p> Leaders that manage through inevitable inflection points by using this mechanism of self-regulation are noticed for their maturity, moral judgment and stability.

Assumptive questions are just that &ndash; they assume an answer rather than ask it, and in doing so, they cut through any hesitation or resistance a prospect is likely to put up. In addition, a good assumptive question also heads off any smokescreen objection a prospect might try to hide behind.</p><p> If you look at your presentation carefully enough, you&rsquo;ll find many opportunities to replace closed ended questions with assumptive ones. Here are some examples to get you started:</p><p> Change: &ldquo;Do you have any questions for me?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;What questions do you have for me?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;Would you like to get more business?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;How much more business would you like to get?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;Do you think you would get more traffic (or leads) from using this?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;How much more traffic (or leads) do you think you&rsquo;d get using us?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;Do you think your other (departments/locations/etc.) could benefit from this?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;How many other (departments/locations/etc.) would benefit from this?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;Do you have a budget for this?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;What kind of budget do you have for this?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;Do you think your partner/manager/corporate would agree with this?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;Why do you think your partner/manager/corporate would agree with this?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;Does this make sense to you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;Tell me, what part of this makes the most sense to you?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;Is this something you&rsquo;d like to go ahead and try?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go ahead and get you started&hellip;&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;What do you think your manager will say?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;How do we get your manager to say yes to this?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;Are you the ultimate decision maker on this?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;And besides yourself, who else would be making the final decision on this?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Change: &ldquo;Is your (current solution) providing all the leads you need?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  To: &ldquo;What would you like to most improve with your (current solution)? </strong></p><p> As you can see, nearly any open ended question can be turned into an assumptive one.

Upspeak describes the tendency by some folks to raise their inflection at the end of a sentence. The individual wishes to make a declarative statement but what comes out sounds like a question.</p><p> Vocal fry describes the habit of drawing out ends of words and sentences with a low, creaky voice.</p><p> Both habits are often ascribed to women. I coach many men, however, who engage in upspeak andvocal fry, as well. These habits significantly impede personal impact.</p><p> I chuckle at a line of reasoning proposed by one of Ms. Gross&rsquo; guests.</p><p> Upspeak and vocal fry are not the problem, she suggests, but our social conditioning that deems these speech patterns unauthoritative is.</p><p> It&rsquo;s my problem and that of others in the room that we find your speech pattern annoying? Good luck in winning that battle!</p><p> Here are 3 simple speaking adjustments that will elevate your personal impact by 50%. They are ridiculously simple. Here&rsquo;s what you do:</p><h3> 1. Keep your sentences short.</h3><p> <br/> Stick to one idea per sentence. Have lots of ideas? Awesome. Start a new sentence for every new idea or message. Run-on sentences are horrid in written documents. They&rsquo;re an even stronger impact-killer in verbal communication.</p><h3> 2. Stop at the end of a sentence.</h3><p> <br/> Your pause lets me know that a thought is complete. It gives me a moment to absorb your idea. And it allows me to tune into what you&rsquo;re about to say next. If you don&rsquo;t pause for 3 sentences in a row, I have already tuned you out!</p><h3> 3. Drop your voice on the last word.</h3><p> <br/> No upspeak please unless you&rsquo;re asking a question. When your inflection goes down on the final word, I get a sense that you mean what you say and that what you say matters. And while you&rsquo;re at it, avoid vocal fry, as well.</p><h3> Ridiculously simple, isn&rsquo;t it?</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s what these adjustments do for you. They bring you into focus. They allow me to hear your message clearly. And even when you don&rsquo;t feel very authoritative inside, these adjustments help you project a sense that you are.</p><p> <strong>  3 little adjustments. 50%.

Offering to Do Too Much","link":"financial-advisers-problem-offering-to-do-too-much","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Despite a couple of decades of positioning, developing and improving technical knowledge and qualifications, many financial professionals are struggling to get enough clients to engage in holistic planning.</p><p> We need to take a leaf out of the accountant and lawyers playbook: Don&rsquo;t try to deal with everything now; just deal with the burning issue of the moment.</p><p> If you think about it most clients getting advice from their other professionals are seeking them out to have perhaps just one thing dealt with.  They need conveyancing done &ndash; now. They need a will &ndash; now.  They need a tax return done &ndash; now. They need an audit &ndash; now.</p><h3> Many clients are interested only in what needs to be done now.</h3><p> <br/> That doesn&rsquo;t make them ignorant or uncaring necessarily, they are just trying manage busy lives and the competing demands for time, attention and money, so they focus on dealing with the urgent.  When they need advice, they often need advice on &ldquo;just this one thing&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Therein lies the financial advisers greatest marketing problem: We offer too much.  We make it too complex. By wanting to talk about this comprehensive advice and planning process we do not appear to meet the immediate need&hellip;WE introduce complexity.</p><p> Financial services globally is increasingly moving down the path of mandating that advisers must make clients think about everything.  That is a barrier to engagement for many clients, simply because it is too hard, and it takes too much time, and frankly it isn&rsquo;t what they wanted.</p><p> The number one challenge for financial advisers is getting enough clients to fully engage with the planning process, and yet it is the enormity of the process which I suspect is the primary barrier to initial engagement.  Certainly we need to educate clients on the benefit of the strategic planning with a long term view, and certainly we need to be try and employ the holistic advice process to help the clients achieve their life goals.</p><h3> But it all begins with a transaction. The planning process begins by just doing one thing.</h3><p> <br/> The point in highlighting this if we know that most great prospects out there in the world who are not yet clients want one thing sorted before they are interested in everything else, then the most effective marketing will be that which highlights the &ldquo;one thing(s)&rdquo; we can fix for them in the short term.</p><p> When prospects engage to have that one thing dealt with, deal with it.  Then let them move on for the moment.  But educate them on the entire range of problem resolution and planning processes you will be able to provide to them.  Maintain high levels of contact and continue to remind them of the other things that can be resolved and create value, and gradually engage them in the holistic planning process.</p><p> That may not be the process as &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; sees it, however it is the reality of meeting the markets needs and demands.  Beginning with a holistic and comprehensive process will prevent many prospects from participating at all in using professional advice.

{"original_id":2337,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Next Generation of Luxury Travel","link":"the-next-generation-of-luxury-travel","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NTWealth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Northern Trust  </u> </a></p><h3> Could the future hold a Jetsons-like world of luxury travel?</h3><p> The adage that the journey is more important than the destination has been tossed about and reworked by poets and songwriters for centuries. In another decade or two, the journey may take an even more unconventional route.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s cramped commercial airplanes and gas-guzzling cars may someday be replaced with autonomous cars, two-wheeled vehicles and even trips to space. Here&rsquo;s a look at a few far-out concepts that just might become reality.</p><h3> Luxury Travel at Hypersonic Speeds</h3><p> The future of air travel could include aircraft that travel at hypersonic &ndash; that&rsquo;s faster than supersonic &ndash; speeds. U.K. company Reaction Engines is studying the possibility of hypersonic aircraft that could take people from Brussels to Sydney in less than five hours, compared to 22 hours today.</p><p> In the shorter term, air travel could undergo changes to remove some of the current headaches. For example, new models for shared private jets continue to emerge. With concierge travel company ClipperJet, $9,500 a month buys four one-way flights plus unlimited flights on a standby basis. For now, the company flies its Gulfstream jets, which accommodate up to 19 people, between Los Angeles and New York. But the company plans to add more legs. Similar models might become popular in coming years, promising alternatives to coach or first-class travel.</p><p> Commercial flights may get a facelift, too. Airbus has introduced a concept cabin that it envisions for the year 2050. It includes private, luxury travel cabins that passengers can design however they want &ndash; as an office, a bedroom or even a park &ndash; using virtual projection technology. A central communal section of the plane could morph to passenger desires: one moment a bar, the next a space for virtual golf competitions.</p><h3> Luxury Travel on the Ground</h3><p> The future of ground transportation might not be quite as exotic as that of air travel, but it could be quite different from the SUVs we&rsquo;re accustomed to today.</p><p> Future ground travel may include an increasing reliance on two-wheeled vehicles, some amount of automation and many more Uber-type services, says Daniel Sperling, professor of civil engineering and environmental science and policy as well as the director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis.</p><p> Two-wheeled vehicles could be used for short trips in the neighborhood, to the store, a friend&rsquo;s house or to get around downtown. But two-wheel doesn&rsquo;t mean bike, motorcycle or Segway. GM unveiled a futuristic two-wheeled, electric concept vehicle that&rsquo;s fully enclosed, seats multiple people and can self-drive.</p><p> The biggest limitation to such vehicles is they&rsquo;re suitable for low-speed trips and as such might not be appropriate on current-style roads, Sperling says. However, entire downtown areas could be restricted to low-speed vehicles or new roads could be built in suburban areas for such vehicles. Sperling notes that some retirement communities already cater to low-speed golf carts.</p><p> Some fairly recent developments will influence how we use full-size cars in the future. Services like Uber and Lyft, which let drivers use their own cars to ferry people around, currently operate like taxi substitutes. &ldquo;But the next step is that they&rsquo;ll take multiple riders,&rdquo; Sperling says. The result is that such services will become even more ubiquitous, reliable and convenient for users.</p><p> Eventually, driverless cars also may take you to your destination, but expect baby steps at first. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll probably be used in some limited applications, like in gated communities or maybe within a parking garage,&rdquo; Sperling predicts.</p><p> That&rsquo;s because regulators may be far from deeming autonomous cars truly safe. &ldquo;If you think about computers now, they break down. Their reliability is not very high,&rdquo; he says, adding that it may be a long while before the computers that run self-driving cars match the safety record of current human-driven cars. In the meantime, automation technologies are making their way into cars &ndash; adding situation awareness to vehicles and some ability to react or warn drivers behind the wheel.</p><h3> Luxury Travel in Space</h3><p> For the true adventurer, space tourism may be an option for the future. Despite last October&rsquo;s fatal crash of Virgin Galactic&rsquo;s SpaceShipTwo (SS2), Richard Branson declared that his company will continue to develop a commercial space program and that the more than 700 pre-registered space tourists will have the opportunity to experience weightlessness.</p><p> A trip aboard Virgin Galactic&rsquo;s aircraft will be truly about the journey, given that its excursions won&rsquo;t actually have a destination. The company initially promised that its &ldquo;affordable space tourist flights&rdquo; would start in 2007 but that first trip hasn&rsquo;t happened &ndash; and the Oct. 31 crash of SS2 undoubtedly will cause further delays.</p><p> Assuming it does start operating in the future, $250,000 could buy three days of training and an excursion that entails five minutes of weightlessness in space before returning to earth.</p><p> Space technology startup Bigelow Aerospace plans to build a space habitat that it will lease to paying customers. While the company primarily is targeting the research community, consumers can spend two months in space living in a 4,000-cubic-foot home for a $50 million. Bigelow&rsquo;s habitat isn&rsquo;t in place yet &ndash; and the company isn&rsquo;t publishing a target date &ndash; so this one could be for future generations.</p><p> So tighten your seatbelts. The destination and journey for luxury travel may take you to some interesting destinations. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-07 15:42:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-07 15:42:15.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_7WEKLjM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-next-generation-of-luxury-travel/\", \"post_id\": \"5279\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-07 15:42:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-07 15:42:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-next-generation-of-luxury-travel\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5278\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2386\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-8.44.16-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"781\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439209800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2336,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Long Am I Going to Live?","link":"how-long-am-i-going-to-live","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As peculiar as such a statement may appear at first glance it is a question that I hear repeatedly from my clients when I do their social security income maximization planning. In order to do any type of retirement income planning you have to make a number of assumptions including expected rates of return on investments, cost of living adjustments (COLA), withdrawal rates, anticipated tax rates and of course life expectancy.  How long do you and your spouse expect to live?</p><h3> As it turns out, most American's \"underestimate\" how long they expect to live.  </h3><p> <br/> In fact, four in ten underestimate their life expectancy by more than five years. Based on current mortality statistics, if a man reaches age 65 he can expect, on average, to live to approximately age 87. If a woman reaches age 65 she can expect to live, on average, to approximately age 89.  <br/> <br/> Clearly, your individual life expectancy is affected by your personal health, family history, lifestyle and numerous other factors. The implications of life expectancy on retirement planning, however, are significant. Mortality risk in retirement is not the risk of dying young and not being able to enjoy your money but rather the risk of living too long and outliving your money. <br/> <br/> With respect to social security retirement income planning, faulty life expectancy assumptions can have a significant affect on deciding what would be the best age to file for social security benefits. By filing too early, you may significantly reduce your eligible social security income in retirement. For example, simply by deferring the start of your social security benefits from age 66 to age 70 you can receive a guaranteed increase in your social security income by 32% plus COLA, which has historically added an additional 2.5% per year to social security income. The compounded effect of COLA adjustments significantly increases your annual and cumulative benefits in retirement. <br/> <br/> The effects of underestimating life expectancy, however, can be potentially devastating to your retirement plan. Most social security recipients who filed early say they regret that they did.  Unfortunately, once you file, very few options are available to improve your benefits. <br/> <br/> Most people approach retirement longing for the day that they can walk away from work for good and start enjoying life. However, when you stop working, not only does your paycheck stop but the likelihood of re-entering the workforce later on, in any meaningful financial way, becomes extremely difficult as well. </p><h3> Many retirees regret retiring from work to early.</h3><p> <br/> They realize later on that a couple of extra years of work not only allows for additional savings it also shortens the number of years needed to finance retirement. It also allows you to defer the start of your social security benefits and therefore provides for a permanently higher lifetime benefit. <br/> <br/> When reviewing your retirement assets and their ability to protect you against the risk of living too long, there are some fundamental risks inherent in these assets which are not shared by social security. For example, if you had a substantial balance in your 401(k) account, and it was invested in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, you have to make a number of assumptions regarding that portfolio's performance over the life of that investment. Looking at historical average rates of return is not enough to identify the likelihood that these assets will last a lifetime.  <br/> <br/> For example, one factor that must be considered is \"sequence of return risk\". Simply put, if you start your retirement in a period when the stock market experiences a sharp decline then you run a much greater risk of outliving your money. Say you retired in 2008 and your account value fell by 50%. To bring your account value back to it's original value you would have to have a 100% increase in your account. That's because your account is now worth half of what it was. Furthermore, you are now retired and drawing down monthly on this account value in order to provide income in retirement. That will put added pressure on the ability for your portfolio to recover. <br/> <br/> This however highlights yet another advantage that social security provides that many other retirement assets do not. Social security is a pension plan that's guaranteed to pay you for as long as you live, insulated from the risks of the stock market. In addition, the COLA adjustments built into the program help provide for protection against inflation in retirement.  <br/> <br/> As such, it may be prudent to consider drawing down on other retirement investments in order to delay the start of social security thereby increasing this guaranteed lifetime income check.  Social security may provide one of the strongest hedges against longevity risk when compared to your other retirement assets. Certainly you should consult with your financial advisor regarding other investments such as SPIA's (single premium immediate annuities) and other annuities which may also provide guaranteed lifetime income. <br/> <br/> <strong>  The many risks that individuals face in retirement (market risk, inflation, health issues, interest rates etc.) are all magnified by longevity risk. </strong> As modern medicine continues to improve at an increasing rate, the likelihood is that life expectancy will also continue to increase. With that, we have to be even more diligent in managing and structuring our retirement assets to meet the financial challenges of living a long life. A properly designed social security income maximization plan can provide a strong foundation on which to build your overall retirement. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-07 15:20:25.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-07 15:20:25.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_kO5jBz3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-long-am-i-going-to-live/\", \"post_id\": \"5277\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-07 15:20:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-07 15:20:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-long-am-i-going-to-live\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5276\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2385\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438030884032-8e6fc76046f5-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"913\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439203500,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2335,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Identity Theft","link":"identity-theft","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Speaking in front of an audience used to be Americans' greatest fear. According to a <u>  <a href=\"http://chapman.edu/wilkinson/research-centers/babbie-center/survey-american-fears.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chapman University study  </a> </u> done last year, public speaking has dropped to number five. Number one is now walking down a dark alley alone.</p><h3> And the number two fear? Identity theft</h3><p> <br/> I found this hard to believe until I started noticing all the ads on identity theft. They warn that not only can your bank account be stolen, so can your retirement nest egg and yes, even your home equity! They suggest you can be wiped out in one fell swoop. What isn&rsquo;t there to be terrified of here?</p><p> The ads' answer to calming your fears is simple: buy identity theft insurance.</p><p> While there is a grain of truth in the outrageous claims, the probability of horrendous financial losses from identity theft is slim. Most identity theft insurance policies provide the services of a professional to help reestablish your credit in addition to covering some monetary losses from a theft.</p><h3> Still, I don&rsquo;t recommend identity theft insurance.</h3><p> <br/> So it was ironic that a few months ago I was the victim of identity theft. Someone from our bank called, suspicious about a scheduled a wire transfer on a personal account for $904 to an account in Mexico. The account had been hacked. As best we could determine, hackers had gained access to my wife&rsquo;s computer which, unknown to us, had the Microsoft update feature disabled 18 months prior and was 161 updates behind.</p><p> We had six other personal and business accounts at this bank under a number of different usernames and passwords. We learned that all these accounts were tied together into one group that could be accessed by any individual account's username and password. The fraud department agent said all the accounts were compromised and would need to be closed.</p><p> Of course, this was a major inconvenience. It meant rescheduling scores of automatic payments on seven checking accounts, getting new authorizations, notifying vendors, and purchasing new checks. But at least the problem was resolved.</p><p> Until three months later my bookkeeper called to ask about nine wire transfers, totaling $6,300, in one month out of one infrequently used account. The bank confirmed that hackers used a username and password to gain access to the account, and the transfers escaped the watchful eye of their fraud department.</p><p> I had not set up online banking on any of the new accounts. There were no usernames or passwords, so how could anyone have gained access? Then I discovered that even though the bank had closed all the accounts and opened new ones, they only disabled the username and password the hackers had used to gain access the first time. They left all the others active.</p><p> This was baffling. It had seemed obvious to me that closing the accounts included disabling all access to the accounts. I found out otherwise.</p><p> Fortunately, the bank covered our loss. We did have to close all the accounts a second time; this time disabling all the usernames and passwords.</p><h3> This experience taught me two lessons.</h3><p> <br/> First, don't assume a protective action has been taken just because it seems obvious to you: ask questions and make sure. Second, if your bank links all your accounts when you do online banking, it may be wise to only have one or two accounts at a bank and only access them using one username and password.</p><p> I also learned that insurance would not have compensated us for our personal time and hassle involved in signing and approving new accounts, something which could not be outsourced. My advice to skip identity theft insurance still stands.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-07 14:11:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-07 14:11:05.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_uG5QZs9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/identity-theft/\", \"post_id\": \"5275\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-07 14:11:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-07 14:11:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"identity-theft\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5274\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2384\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-06-at-10.21.04-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"504\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1439226000,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

Any effort not central to that goal should be minimized.</li><li> <strong>  Select an appropriate patent attorney. </strong> A patent attorney should be chosen on the basis of experience in the areas germane to the field of the company, his/her familiarity with working for start-ups, expectations for payment of fees (for instance, will he/she tolerate waiting for your company to be funded before being paid), experience with both prosecution (e.g., patent development and filing) and litigation, and your own intuition about developing a good working relationship with the patent attorney.</li><li> <strong>  Continuous surveillance of the external landscape. </strong> Regular searches of granted patents is essential to keep on top of developments, but it should be kept in mind that those granted patents will be based on technology and ideas developed several years earlier. So, while relevant, these granted patents only define the rough areas where you may or may not operate. Patent attorneys are useful in surveying and understanding the patent landscape and will often refer to the concept of &ldquo;freedom to operate,&rdquo; or FTO, as a fundamental principle behind the more general notion of external landscape. The external landscape also includes reviews of competitor products, marketing materials, and web postings, as well as incidental conversations with competitors at conferences and similar venues, etc. Understanding prior art and the data from FTO searches are vital pieces of knowledge for tailoring innovations, inventions, and IP (especially claims) so that they can eventually compete in the public marketplace. Envisioned products to be sold must be supported by underlying markets that are large and growing or offer high potential gross margins. Understanding the external landscape is an intrinsic part of the marketing-and-sales plan.</li><li> <strong>  Consider the number of formal patents. </strong> Given the cost factors and importance of the invention itself, a few good high-quality patent applications are much preferred over a plethora of lesser applications. It is tempting to file many applications with the thought that the sheer number of patent filings will make the company more valuable. Such value creation may not accrue, however; investors will spend considerable time attempting to understand the potential of an invention in terms of future revenue and profit and may not agree with founders. Patent applications that lack in innovation, quality of invention, or usefulness in terms of potential future products and markets will erode investor opinions of the value of the investment opportunity. Simply put, fewer high-quality applications are generally better than higher numbers of lesser quality.</li><li> <strong>  Make a long-term budget and be realistic. </strong> Entrepreneurs and their patent attorneys should carefully select countries to file in to make optimum use of cash relative to their market/profit potential. File only NPAs that are essential. Carefully differentiate ideas and innovations that should be patented (to create value, protect products and markets, etc.) from those that can be more economically preserved as trade secrets. Creating IP can be expensive. The cost for filing patents and prosecuting them (including maintenance expenses) must be included in the financial plan. When, as is often the case, patents are filed in multiple countries (e.g., major markets), the cost increases proportionately. PPAs are relatively inexpensive and can be filed in as many numbers as deemed necessary to capture the incremental improvements of the invention and their proof of patentability.</li><li> <strong>  Consider the &ldquo;promotional&rdquo; value of the patent filings. </strong> Patents may take years to develop, and in the years between the filing of a PPA and the receiving of the granted patent, the written information available for the inventor/entrepreneur for use with potential investors is limited to the filing papers for the patent application. Thus, aside from the obvious value of generating good and robust patents, their usefulness begins the day the PPA/NPAs are filed. Promoting the value of the patent applications based on the quality of the written word (in addition to the invention, of course) can be achieved though good writing, solid arguments, and profuse and relevant data.</li><li> <strong>  Preserve IP as trade secrets. </strong> Some thinking should go into the issue of what IP should be kept as patents and what should be kept as trade secrets. For instance, aspects of the invention that may be easily seen in a product (visual) may be patented, as detection of infringement is relatively easy. On the other hand, process-oriented IP (e.g., how something is manufactured or made by chemical composition, etc.) may be better preserved as a trade secret, as discovery of infringement may be too problematic and expensive. If something can be reverse engineered (most everything can be) or made in several different ways, then a process patent may have less use; however, if there is only one best or unique way and you intend (or have money) for major markets, then it may be worth patenting versus keeping as trade secret. These can be difficult issues, and their resolution should be accomplished in consultation with the company&rsquo;s patent attorney. <br/>  </li><p> Deciding whether to patent something or preserve it as a trade secret is often an important issue with respect to developing an IP portfolio. On the one hand, patents are well understood and often formally valued, but trade secrets, while appreciated, can be somewhat amorphous and hard to validate in terms of value.</p><h3> Othen Important Actions</h3><p> <br/> Other important aspects to consider in the IP strategy are:</p><li> <strong>  Keep IP ownership clean and unambiguous. </strong> Many potential start-ups have been stopped in their tracks when their founders discovered that ownership of IP was confused by one or more factors, such as <li>  Lack of proof of IP assignment to the company. This often occurs either through negligence or absence of timeliness on the part of a founder/inventor who is hesitant to share IP presently in her/his name with the company in the form of an assignment document. </li> <li>  Founders who have come from, or are still working at, another company whose technological focus is very similar to that of the new start-up contemplated for formal incorporation. In this situation, the ownership of the envisioned IP (usually in the form of ideas not documented yet) is suspect because of the prior or current employment. These situations are extremely problematic for future investors because of many potential unknown factors. These factors must be sorted out with a patent attorney before forward motion can be achieved. It is often better to simply not invent or file a PPA until the terms of the prior employer&rsquo;s employment (or separation) agreement is satisfied and a period of time has passed since resignation. </li> <li>  Employment agreements that secure IP developed during employment have not been executed, and discoveries, innovations, and inventions have occurred before a legal relationship is secured via the employment agreement. </li> <li>  A founder&rsquo;s use of a prior or current employer&rsquo;s resources or development on company time without disclosure or agreement to distinguish the ownership of the IP. </li></li><li>   <strong>  File &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; patent applications as a way to economically preserve multiple inventions. </strong> An omnibus patent application is one for which multiple separate inventions are expected to be the result of the USPTO&rsquo;s initial application review. While some may argue that separate applications should be made from the onset, the advantage of the omnibus application is that it establishes a filing date for all the potential inventions at the price of an individual application. The USPTO will have an initial office action that specifies that one or more invention applications be subsequently filed. At that later time, the entrepreneur may elect, with patent counsel concurrence, to file the individual patent applications believed most appropriate. While some time is lost with respect to filing the other applications, by that time, the entrepreneur may have raised more funds for the purpose of building the IP portfolio.</li><li> <strong>  Consider acquiring IP from external sources. </strong> Securing additional IP that can support the company&rsquo;s goals is a potentially valuable strategy. IP can be secured from universities, other companies, and governmental sources (NASA, DOD, etc.). While securing the agreement can be challenging for a young company with limited or no resources, potential license agreements can be momentarily secured via agreements that call for only a token up-front payment in return for time (six months or a year) needed to raise additional money.</li><li> <strong>  Train employees to be sensitive to the importance of IP. </strong> While the formality of a patent application often serves to secure IP for the company, other forms of IP, such as trade secrets, have no legal protection (outside employment, nondisclosure, and noncompete agreements) and can be easily divulged, often by accident. Employees need to be instructed on the forms of IP, their importance to the company, and the mechanisms and procedures used to secure and protect that IP. This training needs to occur for all new employees, and all employees need to be reminded on a regular basis of their legal obligations and the company&rsquo;s policies.</li><li> <strong>  Preserve IP with contractors with agreements. </strong> Agreements with contractors and consultants must contain clear language as to the ownership of that IP in all its forms. If the company pays for consulting or research, it is generally recognized that the paying party owns 100 percent of the IP; however, legal agreements must make this clear. For example, copyright ownership with a nonemployee requires that the work be characterized as a &ldquo;work for hire.&rdquo; Consultants need to be reminded and sensitized to their obligation to not discuss company research or activities.</li><li> <strong>  Protect IP when discussing technology with strategic partners or potential customers. </strong> IP can be created when discussions with partners&rsquo; employees occur in unscripted situations and without agreements that define who owns the ideas and derivative IP. This situation can occur with strategic partners and potential customers when advance sales are contemplated. Salespeople are prone to discuss technology, innovations, etc., whenever they suspect a potential sale can result. Salespeople must be advised to simply collect information on problems experienced by the customer and the products/solutions desired. Those problems/issues can be brought back to the technical team for solution determination and possible patent filings. Once a PPA is filed that addresses the solution, the sales team, under a confidentiality agreement, can return to the customer and present/disclose a potential solution. The customer then knows that the underlying invention is owned by the early-stage company. </li><li> <strong>  Be sure to maintain patents by paying fees when required. </strong> The company&rsquo;s patent attorney will maintain schedules of filings, office actions, USPTO filing fees, etc., so generally a CEO/CTO will not need to do the tracking.</li><p> <br/> An IP strategy does not need to be documented in a long, formal document; however, it should be documented in several pages and then made in the form of a corporate policy for each employee to read and understand. The IP strategy can be promulgated to employees with e-mails (all or in part), along with regular reminders and meetings with senior managers.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-06 21:04:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-06 21:04:46.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_8SRP4cW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/so-what-is-an-ip-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"5273\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-06 21:04:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-06 21:04:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"so-what-is-an-ip-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5272\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2383\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2014-05-15-Life-of-Pix-free-stock-photo-montreal-indoor-corridor-light-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1128\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438938600,"author_id":408,"chart_url":""}

Vulnerability! The fact that we will never, ever be perfect!&rdquo; </strong></p><p> So began our leadership sessions last week. You might think with an opening like that, my group would have turned and run for the hills. Quite the contrary: After an initial moment of &ldquo;For real?&rdquo; these professionals delved into our topics with honesty and great candor.</p><p> Afterwards, I think we all left the room feeling like a weight had lifted.</p><p> Professor and author Brene Brown has paved this path of conversation for us with The Gifts of Imperfection and, more recently, Daring Greatly. Her practical, down-to-earth warmth coupled with decades of research has opened floodgates of discussion. Once-taboo topics that deeply impact us all can now hold center stage.</p><p> So what place does vulnerability hold in leadership? How can the awareness of shame actually enhance our effectiveness at work? What does &ldquo;wholehearted living&rdquo; have to do with career success?</p><p> As it turns out, the leadership implications of Brene&rsquo;s work are significant. Consider your own role, for example. Do you:</p><li> Engage openly in difficult conversations rather than tiptoeing around them?</li><li> Provide honest feedback, coming from a place of connection and growth?</li><li> Acknowledge that you don&rsquo;t have all the answers and are o.k. with that?</li><li> Allow people to dare greatly - even though mistakes and failures may ensue? <br/>  </li><h3> And here&rsquo;s a big one: Do you admit your own mistakes and failures? Even to those you lead?</h3><p> <br/> In a group coaching session recently, a few of my clients were discussing failure, fear, and vulnerability. &ldquo;I always thought admitting my failures would decrease others&rsquo; respect for me,&rdquo; one courageous professional admitted. &ldquo;When I shared my big flub-up last year though, I experienced an outpouring of support and a newfound level of respect because I was real. Now my team knows they can take risks &ndash; even if they mess up sometimes &ndash; because how else do you grow?&rdquo;</p><p> Vulnerability isn&rsquo;t letting it all hang out; rather, as Brene writes, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;sharing our feelings and experiences with people who have earned the right to hear them.&rdquo; A few other nuggets to bring into your leadership:</p><li> Be You. Whether your leadership style is charismatic joviality or quiet compassion, flow with your strengths. &ldquo;Authenticity,&rdquo; Brene shares, &ldquo;is the daily practice of letting go of who we think we&rsquo;re supposed to be and embracing who we are.&rdquo;</li><li> Quit Comparing. Seek mentors and role models, look for opportunities to grow, but don&rsquo;t bother with comparison. We can all probably relate to Brene&rsquo;s words here: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;m feeling so good about myself and my life and my family, and then in a split second it&rsquo;s gone because I consciously or unconsciously start comparing myself to other people.&rdquo;</li><li> Make It Meaningful, whatever your profession or role. &ldquo;When we cultivate our gifts and share them with the world,&rdquo; she confirms, &ldquo;we create a sense of meaning and purpose in our lives.&rdquo;</li><p> <br/> As a leader, be willing to dare greatly. Dare to take a stand. Dare to stand up for yourself.

Should We?","link":"remembering-should-we","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;The greatest advances in human civilization have come when we recovered what we had lost: when we learned the lessons of history.&rdquo; Winston Churchill</p><h3> Remembering history. Should we? What good is it anyways?</h3><p> <br/> The past is the past. How relevant is a world where technology was so weak, so non-integrated? Think about merely seven years ago. The iPhone was five months old, Twitter was barely on the horizon, much of what we consider intrinsic in our daily lives today was not really present at all.</p><p> Many great innovators of the past have trumpeted a disdain for the study of history. Henry Ford said &ldquo;History is more or less bunk. It&rsquo;s tradition. We don&rsquo;t want tradition. We want to live in the present, and the only history that is worth a tinker&rsquo;s damn is the history we make today.&rdquo; Napoleon said &ldquo;History is a set of lies agreed upon.&rdquo; So is a review of the past a worthy endeavor? Shouldn&rsquo;t we be much more focused on the future? Would not the study of Mobility, Big Data, Cloud, Social Media and Clean Energy be a much wiser investment of our time?</p><p> This certainly seems the pattern in our schools. In a recent survey by Newsweek, 73 percent couldn&rsquo;t correctly say why we fought the Cold War, 44 percent were unable to define the Bill of Rights and 6 percent couldn&rsquo;t even circle Independence Day on a calendar. [1] And those are events of importance in our nation&rsquo;s history. What about a student of technology? Why would it be important to dig into events such as the <a href=\"http://technologycreated.com/2012/12/02/a-rollout-like-no-other/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   introduction of the Model A by Henry Ford in 1927  </u> </a>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/11-077.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the failure of IBM to react to Microsoft&rsquo;s entry into the PC market  </a> </u>  in the early 1980&rsquo;s?</p><p> The answer of course is decidedly yes and there are (at least) five reasons why:</p><h3> There&rsquo;s nothing new under the sun.</h3><p> <br/> Are you stuck for ideas? History is full of them. Become a student of history and see how previous inventors came up with their ideas. For example, you could read the story of young John Deere [2]. A blacksmith in Vermont, his bankruptcy forced him to move west to the frontier (Illinois!) to begin again where he set up shop as a general repairman and manufacturer of small tools. One of the biggest challenges for local farmers was that cast iron plows just didn&rsquo;t work very well in the sticky prairie soil. They were constantly having to stop plowing to clean off their plows. Thinking back to his days in Vermont, Deere remembered well the manufacture of steel needles for leather makers and how polishing the steel allowed the needles to more easily penetrate the tough leather used to make saddles. Could he apply those same polishing principles to the manufacture of a plow? In fact, why not make the plow out of steel instead of cast iron? And why not polish the steel so that mud would simply slide off? This is exactly what he did and his invention transformed the work day for prairie farmers allowing their productivity to flourish and paving the way for America to become the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;bread basket.&rdquo;</p><h3> Necessity is the mother of invention.</h3><p> <br/> Do you feel blocked? Does it seem the path forward, the road most people travel just simply doesn&rsquo;t exist for you? Join the crowd of those whose future wasn&rsquo;t formed through passion or inspiration, but necessity and determination and perseverance. Consider the example of Josiah Wedgwood [3] the youngest son of a potter in England in the 1700s. Having suffered an attack of small pox at the age of eleven, Josiah&rsquo;s right knee was permanently damaged, leaving him unable to work the potter&rsquo;s wheel. But instead of abandoning the trade, he decided to focus his time on researching the craft of pottery. Concentrating on the scientific advances of his day, he was able to revolutionize, not only the practice of creating high quality pottery, but the approach to mass producing it. In fact, his craftsmanship was of such beauty and quality he began receiving orders from the highest levels of English royalty, most notably Queen Charlotte herself. Because of his efficient approach to mass production and mass distribution, he was able to create a factory system, build assembly lines and lower the price enough to create the first real world consumer market. By the late 1700&rsquo;s fine china had become a common place addition to homes throughout England and America.</p><h3> Avoiding the same mistakes.</h3><p> <br/> This is a tough one obviously. If it were easy to avoid previous mistakes, we would always avoid them. But one of the ways we can recognize challenges ahead of time is to be a student of history. For example, why does it consistently seem to be true that &ldquo;Dominant incumbent firms, long successful in an existing technology, are often much less successful in new technological eras.&rdquo;[4] This seems counter-intuitive. Incumbent firms would appear to have the advantage. They have the knowledge, the resources, the size, the capital. Why would they simply not be able to more effectively and easily move to a new market and opportunity as they occur?  Two signature examples are IBM&rsquo;s failure to capitalize on the personal computer market and Microsoft&rsquo;s slow and late reaction to the widespread adoption of the Internet. Both  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter\" target=\"_blank\">   Joseph Schumpeter  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.innosight.com/about-us/clayton-christensen.cfm?gclid=CJvWvvauirsCFaE1Qgod-TYAZg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Clayton Christensen  </a> </u>  have much to say about this. Your understanding, your investigation of these and other historical examples could give you the ability to recognize when you&rsquo;re in that same position and devise a sensible course of action.</p><h3> History repeats itself.</h3><p> <br/> Yup, this is the one at least everyone seems to agree with. Yet typically people cite simple examples; like New Coke or the Edsel. That&rsquo;s all well and good but how about a macro perspective on technological eras and understanding where in the cycle we stand? Carlota Perez&rsquo;s important book &ldquo;Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital&rdquo; [5] posits that &ldquo;economic growth since the end of the eighteenth century has indeed gone through five distinct stages, associated with five successive technological revolutions.&rdquo; She holds that these revolutions occur roughly every fifty years and that there is a distinct sequence of events that occur in each: technological revolution &ndash; financial bubble &ndash; collapse &ndash; golden age &ndash; political unrest.(page 5) Sound familiar? The current era, &ldquo;The Age of Information and Telecommunications&rdquo; began in 1971 with the introduction of the Intel microprocessor. When will the next era begin and how can we prepare for it? According to Perez, &ldquo;The favorable conditions for the next revolution are created when the potential of the previous one approaches exhaustion.&rdquo; (page 27). Are we there yet? What is the fundamental signature revolutionary event of the next era? Was it the development of Amazon Web Services that has made computing power and information accessible cheaply, dynamically and ubiquitously? Or is it the popularization of funding platforms like KickStarter that is leading to a new industrialization? Or is it something yet unforeseen on the horizon? The key takeaway here is, preparing for what&rsquo;s coming is equal parts understanding the current landscape of emerging technology and business as well as knowing the fundamental dynamics of technology and business from the past. The most prescient people are grounded in both the future and the past.</p><h3> Believe the hype.</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes you just need to think about what&rsquo;s possible. As Scott Berkun mentions in this  <u>  talk </u>  [6], consider Thomas Edison. Did he invent the light bulb? Well, actually no. But everyone attributes that invention to him. Why? Think about the modern home in the late 1800&rsquo;s. It had no electricity. There was no wiring to power lighting in the home. There were no power lines to pull electricity into the homes. There were no power plants to generate that electricity. Why do people give Edison credit for the light bulb? Because he perfected the system that made the light bulb a worthwhile invention. This was no easy task. He had to design an entire system that included sockets, fuses, switches, power meters and generators. Then there needed to be a huge capital build out including laying cables under the streets. Finally, the public needed to be convinced that electricity was safe. What are the parallels for today? The light bulb turned out to be the &ldquo;killer app&rdquo; that ushered in the golden age of appliances that changed the homes of the world. The light bulb was quickly followed by the electric fan, the electric iron and the electric toaster. Question: what will be the killer app for the &ldquo;Internet of Things?&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s a huge challenge to predict the future. Are you driven to know how it will play out? Do you hope to play a part, perhaps provide innovation and direction in some small (or big) way that influences the future? Fortunately, history provides a guide. It&rsquo;s a textbook of proven methods and practices that are laid out for you in striking detail. Get to know your fellow innovators from the past and you will have a wonderful guidebook to the role you can play in shaping the future.</p><p>  </p>[1] Andrew Romano, &ldquo;How Dumb Are We?&rdquo; Newsweek (March 20, 2011),<u> http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/03/20/how-dumb-are-we.html</u><br/>[2] &ldquo;Timeline.&rdquo; John Deere.

But, what if it was really the other way around? If we look deep into ourselves, we might realize that there is not a giving problem that stands in the way of our ability to receive what is right for us. Instead, for many of us, it&rsquo;s actually a receiving problem. I often say, \"we attract what we are prepared to receive\".</p><p> For many of us, receiving good fortune acts as a danger trigger to our automatic brain. For example, growing up you may have heard statements like, &ldquo;those greedy business owners&rdquo; or &ldquo;blessed be the poor.&rdquo; So fast-forward now to you as an adult. Let&rsquo;s say you have a great idea for a new business and start getting some incredible breaks. As the days and weeks go by though, your enthusiasm wanes and you develop some anxiety, trepidation and even some sad, melancholic moods. This is because we have a primitive nature controlled by what I have called the automatic brain, or AB. This brain causes us to fight or flee what it detects to be dangerous. If success somewhere in your data banks equates with greedy, then your AB will cause you to fight or flee it.</p><h3> The Big Three &ldquo;Danger&rdquo; Triggers</h3><p> <br/> Money, health and relationships are the big three danger triggers. Ever been involved in a great relationship, or experienced good fortune and found yourself wondering when everything was going to go sour? Triggers often can leave us anxious and feeling like the other shoe is getting ready to drop.</p><p> What if you won the lottery tomorrow? Would that take care of all of your problems? I doubt it. Because if you are not used to such wealth, in other words it is unfamiliar to you, or your family associated greed with and disgust for people who had money, then your AB will cause you to fight or flee it. How will that show itself? Likely, with failed relationships, careless use of the money, or worry about health concerns.</p><h3> Accepting Our Good Fortune</h3><p> <br/> When good fortune occurs, one must accept it without any preconceived notions of what it might mean. Receive any gift with open arms. Feelings of guilt or obligation always arise from our primitive nature located in our AB, which stores all the data that (usually from childhood) of what it means to be a good person. When we learn to receive, with no strings attached&mdash;that is, not believing that our good fortune is somehow dangerous, as dictated by our AB&mdash;we then position ourselves to want to give on our own terms, with no strings attached, either.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-06 17:40:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-06 17:40:00.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_65p4PQN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-law-of-attraction-requires-this-to-work/\", \"post_id\": \"5265\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-06 17:40:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-06 17:40:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-law-of-attraction-requires-this-to-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5264\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2379\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-06-at-10.44.59-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"485\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438974300,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2328,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do You Share These 4 Habits of the Wealthy?","link":"do-you-share-these-4-habits-of-the-wealthy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In his book &ldquo;Rich Habits: The Daily Success Habits Of Wealthy Individuals,&rdquo; author  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RICHHABITS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Thomas Corley  </a> </u>  outlines what he learned when he surveyed both wealthy and struggling Americans about their habits and attitudes.</p><p> Here are a few &ldquo;rich habits&rdquo; he identified that are worth integrating into your professional, financial, and even personal life, to help you on the road to achieving your own goals.</p><h3> The Wealthy are Goal-Oriented</h3><p> <br/> Corley found that 67% of the wealthy people he surveyed put their goals in writing, 62% of them focus on their goals every day, and a whopping 81%  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/rich-people-daily-habits-2014-6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   keep a to-do list  </a> </u> .</p><p> It&rsquo;s hard to reach your goals if you&rsquo;re not focused on them and they&rsquo;re not your top priority, and it can be daunting to have too many goals (one reason so few people are able to keep their New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions.)</p><p> A more productive approach is to prioritize one important goal, create a plan of actionable steps that help you accomplish that goal, then add those steps, tasks and habits to your daily to-do list. These three simple steps will give your increased focus and will help you move closer to that goal.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve incorporated them in your daily routine, identify a second goal and follow the same plan. The key to success is taking it one step at a time!</p><h3> The Wealthy Use Downtime Wisely</h3><p> <br/> At the end of your workday, do you like to relax with Netflix, video games, or YouTube? According to Corley&rsquo;s data, 66% of the wealthy said that they watch less than an hour of television a day, 63% spend less than an hour a day on the Internet unless it is job-related, an impressive 79% say they read career and educational material each day, and an equally impressive 63% said &ldquo;I listen to audio books during the commute to work.&rdquo;</p><p> While we all like to relax and recharge with entertaining media, that time can never be recovered for things that help you become a stronger, more successful individual like reading, networking, exercising, or volunteering for a cause you believe in.</p><p> Time is the great equalizer: we all have 24 hours a day. What you choose to do with that time can either help you to reach your financial and life goals, or distract you from it, so choose wisely!</p><h3> The Wealthy Invest in Their Future</h3><p> <br/> Corley&rsquo;s research also showed that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.success.com/article/16-rich-habits\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the wealthy live within their means  </a> </u> , pay themselves first, and don&rsquo;t overspend.</p><p> Building wealth is not accomplished by upgrading to each new electronic gadget, leasing the newest model car, and living in an extravagant home. The wealthy, according to Corley, spend less than they earn, own and maintain their cars for many years, and save a significant portion of their income. While saving money and living modestly is not as sexy as a flashy smartphone, it will go a lot further toward providing a comfortable future.</p><p> Living within your means also includes not carrying credit card balances or heavy debt. When you are carrying debt, what you earn today is paying for yesterday&rsquo;s expenses. Living within your means while saving and investing a portion of your income lets you invest in tomorrow, rather than yesterday, while learning to be satisfied with what you have today.</p><h3> The Wealthy are Willing to Take Risks</h3><p> <br/> Another fascinating finding of Corley&rsquo;s research is that 63% of the wealthy people he interviewed said they that they had  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ways-rich-people-think-differently-2014-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   taken risks  </a> </u>  in search of wealth, while only 6% of the struggling Americans he interviewed said that they had taken risks.</p><p> For many, fear of failure is a great de-motivator and can be paralyzing. When you do not fully understand something, whether it&rsquo;s a challenge, a potential project, an investment, or even a social problem, it can be easier to do nothing than to act. But without risk, there is often no reward.</p><p> What Corley discovered is that, instead, rather than fearing failure, the wealthy consider failure to be part of the process and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; an opportunity to learn.</p><p> How can you face risk without fear so that you can seize potential opportunities? Educating yourself is the key step. Researching the investment, the project, or the choice, and learning about the options and risks, help keep fear and anxiety about the unknown from clouding your decision-making process.</p><p> Even with the best preparation though, choices don&rsquo;t turn out as envisioned. When that happens, take a page from the wealthy: learning from those failures and experiences will lead to more opportunities and better choices down the road!</p><h3> Are Your Own Habits Setting You Up for Success?</h3><p> <br/> While following each of these habits may not make you rich, they will certainly help you get into a success mind-set. 68% of the Americans on Forbes billionaire list consider themselves to be &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.business-management-degree.net/features/wealthiest-people/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   self-made billionaires  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; which means that they worked hard to reach their own professional and financial goals.

{"original_id":2327,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is “Longing For Yesterday\" Bad For Leaders?","link":"is-longing-for-yesterday-bad-for-leaders","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Recently I was speaking with a senior leader who felt her workplace had gone to the dogs. She felt there was a lack of respect and commitment with the people she interacted.&ldquo;Things were so much better years ago at our firm. People followed through on their responsibilities and put in the hours needed to complete the job&rdquo;, she shared. &ldquo;But no one seems to care today and would rather just run out the door and leave it all behind for someone else to pick up the pieces.&rdquo;She was sensing a big change in attitude and behavior with her team, but couldn&rsquo;t figure out why this was happening and how she could change it. She was longing for yesterday and wondered if she was an ineffective leader to feel that way. We got to talking and began to think that yesterday was not all bad.Here is what we decided:</p><h3> Bring Back The Respect</h3>Having a culture that exudes respect is still critical in all our worlds of work. If we can&rsquo;t communicate in a respectful way, we will never be influential. If we can&rsquo;t see another person&rsquo;s point of view that is different from ours, we can&rsquo;t learn new things. What does being <u> <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2014/03/17/do-you-listen-with-respect/#sthash.lJvxq8Ro.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  respectful </a></u> look like?<li> Listening without judging</li><li> Commenting with kindness</li><li> Supporting each other&rsquo;s ideas and suggestions</li><li> Making those around us feel valued</li><u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Leaders+know+that+respect+will+always+be+an+essential+part+of+organizations.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/08/03/is-longing-for-yesterday-bad-for-leaders/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Leaders know that respect will always be an essential part of organizations. </a></u><h3> Be Open to New Attitudes</h3>The world is changing and so must we to build healthy and transparent relationships. There are <u> <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2013/10/01/why-harmonizing-different-generations-makes-sense/#sthash.A2TMuP1c.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  four generations </a></u> working along side of each other today and that means different attitudes about work. Years ago putting in long hours at our desks was a standard many companies followed. Today, we can work from home or on a plane. We can even spend less time due to technology. We need to think about performing our jobs in a more flexible way, not with specific hours or location.<u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=We+can+perform+our+jobs+today+anywhere+and+anytime.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/08/03/is-longing-for-yesterday-bad-for-leaders/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  We can perform our jobs today anywhere and anytime. </a></u><h3> Create Inclusiveness</h3>Diversity adds texture, innovation and excitement to our organizations and that means we must be welcoming of everyone. I worked with one leader who decided to add a &ldquo;culture day&rdquo; to learn about the different backgrounds of the team members. It became a day that people looked forward to both sharing and growing.<h3> Discuss What Should Stay and What Should Go</h3>When companies and teams talk about the type of <u> <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2011/01/17/attention-leaders-create-your-dream-culture/#sthash.YtuIsJlV.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  culture </a></u> they value, it can be so empowering. A great way to get a dialogue started on what each team member thinks the work environment should look like is pose some helpful questions:<li> What is the best part of being part of this team?</li><li> What would you change and why?</li><li> How can we cultivate stronger work relationships?</li><li> Which processes of the past still work and which ones might you update or throw out?</li><li> What is preventing you from leading?</li><u> <a href=\"https://www.terriklassconsulting.com/empowered-leadership-ebook/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Download </a></u> these leadership exercises to empower you and your team to tackle some of these questions.

{"original_id":2325,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Blogging Fundamentals","link":"blogging-fundamentals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We&rsquo;ve said it before and we&rsquo;ll say it again: blogging is one of the greatest opportunities to engage with your clients and prospects.</p><p> To help you get started, or to help you stay on the right track, we&rsquo;ve put together a list of blogging fundamentals.</p><h3> Get the right writers on board</h3><p> <br/> The best writer may not be who you think it is. And people with a lot of customer contact are often the best sources for blog topics. When putting your content team together, it helps to think outside the box.</p><h3> Customers come first</h3><p> <br/> Ask yourself: What advice can we provide? How are people using our products? The best posts often solve your clients&rsquo; problems.</p><h3> Always look on the bright side of life</h3><p> <br/> Given the changes that are happening in the financial services industry, it can be tempting to get critical. But there&rsquo;s no place for snarky remarks, attacks or cheap shots in business blogging. Online readers can cut and paste &ndash; or take screen shots &ndash; and post them to social networks.</p><h3> SEO is not your primary concern</h3><p> <br/> Google is always changing its algorithms to be more social. That is, shareability is becoming fundamental to online success while keywords are becoming less important. Keep this in mind when creating your editorial calendar.</p><h3> Find more readers</h3><p> <br/> People often shy away from promoting things that aren&rsquo;t perfect &hellip; especially if they think it might hurt the business. That won&rsquo;t work with blogging. You need to promote your blog to get new readers. Social media and email are good promotion tools to consider.</p><h3> Write a strong call to action</h3><p> <br/> With a call to action, you&rsquo;re driving your readers to engage with your company. A call to action can be as simple as including a link to another page on your website, a request to contact you with any questions or an invitation to connect on LinkedIn.</p><h3> Blogging is long term</h3><p> <br/> Blogging is a marathon, not a sprint. It&rsquo;s like climbing up a mountain, not skiing down it. You need to stay dedicated, even when you&rsquo;re struggling. And, as you build up content, you&rsquo;ll see more successes.</p><h3> Consistency matters</h3><p> <br/> Every blog post is another opportunity to engage a client or prospect. If you post once a month, you&rsquo;ll get 12 opportunities to share your message every year. If you post every week, you&rsquo;re in the 50s. It won&rsquo;t take long to find your company&rsquo;s sweet spot.</p><h3> Limit analysis, for now</h3><p> <br/> Page views, bounce rates and pages-per-visit are all good to know. But they aren&rsquo;t necessary. The same is true for keywords, unique visitors and loyalty. Be honest with yourself: if you think learning about all of this will sully your blogging adventure, don&rsquo;t bother with it until you&rsquo;re ready.</p><h3> Get blogging advice</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re tight on time or resources, think about working with a blogging consultant who understands the needs of your business. A blogging pro will help you build a strategy around your resources, goals and brand.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-06 16:23:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-06 16:23:19.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_bG5n7aw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/blogging-fundamentals/\", \"post_id\": \"5255\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-06 16:23:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-06 16:23:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"blogging-fundamentals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5254\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2374\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2014-07-life-of-pix-free-stock-photos-belgium-brussels-city-soap-bubble-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"326\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438963200,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}

As a result, you may find yourself continuously struggling to prove to your colleagues and the management that you are worthy of a higher or a better position.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what you should do to make sure you are not overlooked for new career opportunities and that you get the respect you deserve:</p><h3> Know your significant and unique value to your organization.</h3><p> <br/> Before you could convince others that you have great value in the company, you must be the one to know or determine it first. Thus, self-evaluation is a crucial step. Over the years you&rsquo;ve been in the company, have you done a lot to contribute to the company&rsquo;s success? What makes you a unique employee? Do you think others value your presence? If so, why? Once you have realized your own value, you can move on to the next step.</p><h3> Acknowledge your own value.</h3><p> <br/> It is important that you respect your job and take pride in how you perform at work. As long as you take your job seriously and believe that it matters to the organization, others will do, too. Take a moment also to find out what other things you can do that will help the company grow. You should also ask management for feedback just so you could know how else you can be better.</p><h3> Let your manager know your value.</h3><p> <br/> Many companies still do annual performance reviews of their employees, and they still use it as basis for choosing who deserves to be promoted or not. You should not, however, rely on this and expect your manager to finally see how well you do your job.</p><p> Ask for a meeting with your manager and express your desire and willingness to give him or her updates about your performance.

Yet most advisors with older clients have done little to build a relationship with the wives of the couple clients they serve.</p><p> To be fair, in all likelihood the husband was the primary contact and the wife frequently showed little interest in getting involved. Nevertheless, the reality is that 80% of widows leave the family&rsquo;s financial advisor when their husbands die saying, &ldquo;I never really knew him and I wanted to find someone I could work with.&rdquo;</p><h3> The writing is on the wall.</h3><p> <br/> Advisors who don&rsquo;t want to lose accounts when the husband dies must engage their wives &ndash; even if these women resist. But don&rsquo;t wait until there is a crisis, it is never too early to start getting the wives of your couple clients engaged. You can&rsquo;t assume that just because &ldquo;Harry&rdquo; has been a great client and friend for years, you will keep the account when he dies.</p><p> Of course, engaging the female partner is not always easy. You may be faced with excuses like, &ldquo;My husband handles all this,&rdquo; &ldquo;I find it boring&rdquo; and even, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand all the jargon.&rdquo;</p><h3> So what&rsquo;s an advisor to do?</h3><p>  </p><li> <strong>  Enlist the husband/partner early </strong> &mdash; by appealing to his sense of responsibility for his partner with a question like &ndash; &ldquo;Harry, what would happen if you became ill or died? Would Ellen be comfortable overseeing the portfolio? What can we do to involve her and make sure she&rsquo;s ready to take over if need be?&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Uncover what&rsquo;s important to her </strong> &mdash; by showing interest in her point of view and the issues particular to her. Make your next meeting about her and engage her in conversation by asking about her dreams for the future. Always remember that women tend to see finances more in terms of life issues, and less about asset allocation or investment returns.</li><li> <strong>  Build her confidence in the investment process </strong> &mdash; assure her that you will work with her to put finances in a way that makes sense to her. By avoiding jargon and speaking in terms of real outcomes (&ldquo;Yes you will be able to support your handicapped child&rdquo;), you will be far more likely to forge a meaningful relationship with her. <br/>  </li><h3> Take away</h3><p> To make sure you retain the account of a couple when the husband dies, you must engage the female partner: enlist her partner to bring her into the conversation, uncover what&rsquo;s important to her and build her confidence in the investment process. Start early and don&rsquo;t wait until the husband becomes ill or worse.</p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

The result, acquiring new clients has become more time consuming and costly.</p><p> Firms that have embraced their online presence and engage regularly with clients and prospects have grown substantially, and those that have continued to rely on the growth strategies of old, have crawled.</p><p> These new age digital tools are not just for large firms with large pockets and online presence. They are available for all, and can be used at all levels to increase client numbers and sales. At econnexx, we are so confident in our service that we guarantee clients an increase in sales. We know that if clients embrace these digital tools in the ways we have tried and tested they will achieve results.</p><p> Online tools are merely forms of communication to initiate conversation. Its starts off as a one-way conversation from the financial adviser, but if the content is interesting enough to the prospect it will become a 2 way conversation, leading to client acquisition and sales. Tools available such as your website and social media are merely channels to initiate and lead your online conversations.</p><p> When we develop strategies for clients of all sizes, we ask them to define their ideal client. From this we base our entire strategy on attracting and nurturing that ideal client.</p><p> Below we have detailed 4 steps to attract your ideal client:</p><h3> Understand your ideal client's needs.</h3><p> <br/> Before you can target and effectively attract your 'ideal client' you have to understand their needs. What is important to them when it comes to your service. Ask yourself what perceived problems do they have and how can your value proposition solve them?</p><p> Establish your ideal client's needs and identify the needs that would be attractive enough for them to engage with you. For example, typical high net worth individuals have 4 main reasons for seeking out financial advice. They are:</p><li>       Taking care of their family</li><li>       Preserving and protecting their wealth</li><li>       Tax concerns</li><li>       They are looking for a partner (you) to help manage and protect their wealth <br/>  </li><h3> Know the character of your ideal client</h3><p> <br/> By creating personas (fictional characters) of the type of people your ideal client is, you create a vision as to what interests they have, what pain points they may have (reasons for not engaging with you), and what type of information you can provide that will resonate with them as well as relieve pain points. By understanding the type of person you want to attract, you are able to develop a content strategy that appeals to their personality and needs.</p><h3> Know how to connect with and appeal to your ideal client type</h3><p> <br/> Almost 90% of consumers that purchase a financial product or service search online for information to educate themselves before they even consider seeking professional advice. Reaching prospective clients at the beginning of their journey is critical to attaining their business. By creating and distributing informative content through social media and blogging, that is relevant to your target client, you will attract their attention. By including links to downloadable offerings such as eBooks (see our eBook offer at the bottom of this post) you will capture their basic contact information should they choose to input their details to download and benefit from the offering. If they do, you have created a valuable contact.</p><h3> Nurture their interest over time</h3><p> <br/> By nurturing your contacts through automated personalised emails containing further valuable content that appeals to their needs, you draw them closer to a buying decision. When they reach the point of purchase it will be your firm they contact, as it was you who provided them with the information they sought, establishing their trust, whilst showcasing your knowledge and expertise.</p><p> The process of inbound marketing is tailored towards only attracting people who you want to attract. By using content marketing to distribute informative material you attract interest of prospective clients right at the very beginning of their buying journey, immediately establishing your firm as an informative resource on relevant matters. Through automated marketing you can then nurture interest until they are ready to commit.</p><h3> Summary</h3><p> <br/> The above steps are part of an overall marketing process with focus on maximising sales and minimising costs. Econnexx only deploy the most effective marketing strategies, strategies that we know generate measurable results for financial firms.</p><p> To find out in detail how you can attract high net worth clients download our definitive free guide  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/how-to-attract-high-net-worth-clients-in-the-financial-sector\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  How To Attract High Net Worth Clients in The Financial Sector </a> .</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-06 14:54:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-06 14:54:57.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_uHCQLAx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-financial-services-firms-can-grow-their-client-bank/\", \"post_id\": \"5249\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-06 14:54:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-06 14:54:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-financial-services-firms-can-grow-their-client-bank\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5248\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2371\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SplitShire-7070-1800x1200-970x500.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"533\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438944300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2320,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Not Making Mistakes Is The Biggest Mistake","link":"why-not-making-mistakes-is-the-biggest-mistake","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  We all make mistakes when pursuing goals or creating new habits. </strong>  Whether it&rsquo;s adding in more exercise, controlling our road rage, or not eating a handful of Reese&rsquo;s Pieces before a meal (yes, that last one just happened), we all have slips when we&rsquo;re trying to make changes.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not going to go into some overplayed spiel on how we are too hard on ourselves or how we need to work on self-forgiveness. All that&rsquo;s true, but you already know it and I don&rsquo;t see the point in writing it.</p><p> I think mistakes are the best thing that ever happened. In fact, it&rsquo;s better to set a goal and fumble along the way than to achieve it perfectly. Why? Because:</p><li> <strong>  No goal worth achieving should be that easy to do. </strong>  If you can do it perfectly, it&rsquo;s not the right goal. Willpower alone isn&rsquo;t enough to get the good stuff. Take a risk and think big.</li><li> <strong>  A goal that&rsquo;s hard gives you more bang for your buck.  </strong> When you hit a wall and persevere, you learn to troubleshoot, tolerate discomfort, and/or ask for help. And we all could stand to improve those skills.</li><li> <strong>  Mistakes allow you to perfect your system. </strong>  Some people give up at the first challenge, others use the challenge to rethink their tactics. And, not surprisingly, the latter are the ones who achieve their goals. The truth is that no amount of planning prepares you 100%, if you aren&rsquo;t willing to be flexible, chances are you won&rsquo;t get there.</li><li> <strong>  How you do anything is how you do everything.  </strong> Similarly, how you screw up one thing is how you screw up everything. (That sounded harsher than I intended, but just go with me on this one.) If your mistake is that you didn&rsquo;t  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/time-management-worksheets\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   budget enough time  </a> </u>  for a task, chances are that&rsquo;s a roadblock in other areas too. Addressing it head on will help you to address it across the board.</li><li> <strong>  Perseverance builds self-trust. </strong>  Every time you make a mistake and quit, you reaffirm the belief that you can&rsquo;t do it. And since that belief has, historically, gotten you less than desirable results, it&rsquo;s time to choose a more resourceful belief. Simply put, if you believe &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a quitter&rdquo; you will use that to rationalize quitting. Instead, consciously choose a belief that gets you the results you want.

To be perfect paleo is a must which means 100% agave tequila. This margarita recipe is light, fresh, and summery &ndash; perfect for the ladies, perfect for summer brunches and perfect to make at home. It uses agave nectar as it&rsquo;s sweetener which is at least 30% sweeter than sugar, has less calories, and is lower on the glycemic index making it the perfect compliment for tequila cocktails. In my younger years I loved the Cadillac Margarita which is sweetened with Grand Marnier and found myself wanting that touch of orange flavor in my perfect margarita. The solution. . . a spin on a classic margarita that uses both muddled lime and orange juices. Perfection! Adding a splash of soda at the end makes this the light and refreshing margarita recipe for summer cocktail drinking. We complete the drink by serving it in a salt rimmed glass with a slice of lime on the side. The salt we used is a flaky river salt by India Tree and has a slight pinkish tinge which makes it oh so pretty! You will find the recipe below as well as the PDF for the recipe card should you want to hang on to it for later, or share it with friends.

Yet, wealth managers with less than 20 years experience are more in touch with HNWIs when it comes to these advice and service related needs (p.29).</p><p> Younger HNWIs are also more mobile than previous generations when it comes to advisory firms. They have a greater propensity to work with multiple firms (p.31) and they are more willing to leave those firms if their wealth needs are not being met (p. 32).</p><p> Finally, younger HNWIs also place a higher value on word-of-mouth referrals with respect to how they are introduced to wealth managers, yet they are technologically savvy enough to do their online research. Therefore, firms need to have solid presence both online and offline to convert these referrals into clients. (p. 32)</p><h3> Emerging technology represents both threats and opportunities for wealth managers and firms</h3><p> <br/> The WWR 2015 identifies three main technology developments as having the potential to impact the relationship between wealth managers and HNWIs:</p><li> Automated advisory services (a.k.a. robo-advisors)</li><li> Open investment communities (crowd-sourced investment advice)</li><li> Third-party technology tools (digital enhancements for wealth managers) <br/>  </li><p> Automated advisory and portfolio management services represent potentially greatest threat to wealth managers because they empower investors through self-service and reduced cost.</p><p> On this issue, wealth managers and firms seem to have their collective heads in the sand. Twice as many HNWIs (and as much as four or five times as many in some regions) demonstrate a propensity for using automated investment management services, as compared to wealth managers who think HNWIs will consider using them.</p><p> <img alt=\"wwr15-hnwi-propensity-to-use-robos\" src=\"http://jaypalter.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wwr15-hnwi-propensity-to-use-robos.png\"/></p><p> According to the authors of the WWR 2015, the threat of automated advisory services can become an opportunity if wealth firms adjust their value proposition:</p><p> &ldquo;As basic asset allocation, investment advisory, and risk profiling services become commoditized, the value proposition of wealth managers is transitioning. It is moving away from stock selection and investment management, toward more holistic financial planning.&rdquo; (p. 36)</p><p> At the same time, technology tools are emerging that can help wealth managers not only level the playing field, but tilt it in their advantage. The report&rsquo;s authors point to a growing number of third-party technology solutions that can increase client engagement through enriched online reporting, more effective use of client data and more professional practice management.</p><p> &ldquo;Wealth managers can overcome the fear of disintermediation in investment management by implementing an IT-enabled approach for client investments that complements the more tailored financial planning services, so they can respond to specific client demands and compete with the disruptive players more effectively.&rdquo; (p. 38)</p><p> As the old adage goes, the best defense is a good offense.</p><h3> The hybrid way forward</h3><p> <br/> Moving forward, the report&rsquo;s authors suggest, most wealth managers and firms will adopt a hybrid model that combines automated, self-serve tools with full-service human advice. After all, that is what their clients say they want &ndash; and most business don&rsquo;t thrive by ignoring their clients&rsquo; needs.</p><p> But there are a number of other areas on which wealth management firms need to focus their improvement and differentiation efforts, including:</p><li> Broadening their service offering;</li><li> Embracing a holistic approach to financial planning;</li><li> Recruiting more younger wealth managers;</li><li> Leveraging technology more effectively; and</li><li> Training and supporting all wealth managers in the fine art of online social networking and personal branding. <br/>  </li><p> &ldquo;Wealth managers can utilize next-generation digital tools (including social media networks) for functions such as prospecting and risk management, as well as wealth planning and aggregation tools to enhance overall service delivery.&rdquo; (p. 38)</p><p> The wealth management industry faces the same dilemma of virtually every business in the digital age: adapt to technological change or stick to the traditional ways.</p><p> The latter path is littered with the remains of old, failed business models. Adaptation, on the other hand, seems to be baked into our evolutionary history as a species.</p><p> You can be sure that if the current wealth management firms can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t adapt, someone else come along that most certainly will.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 18:44:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 18:44:02.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_IJSQBTX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"post_id\": \"5237\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 18:44:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 18:44:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5236\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2366\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438758886433-4875b7ad923b-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"540\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438858800,"author_id":219,"chart_url":""}

Which begs the question of why we have something called  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">   the Federal Reserve System  </a> </u>  in the first place.</p><p> Historically, the reason we have something now called the Fed is because of a  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907\" target=\"_blank\">   banking panic that happened in 1907  </a> </u> . The 1907 Knickerbocker crisis was a financial crisis that took place over a three-week period starting in mid-October 1907, when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year&mdash; <u>  <a href=\"http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2015/03/everything-you-know-about-1929-is-wrong.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a much bigger drop than the 1929 drop  </a> </u> . (So take note: The 1907 stock-market event was bigger than the 1929 event, yet didn't cause a Great Depression. Also note, the Fed already existed in 1929 and yet failed to prevent the Great Depression.) <br/> <br/> With regard to the 1907 crash, we learn from Wikipedia:</p>Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_shop_(stock_market)\" target=\"_blank\"> bucket shops</a>. The panic was triggered by the failed attempt in October 1907 to corner the market on stock of the United Copper Company. When this bid failed, banks that had lent money to the cornering scheme suffered runs that later spread to affiliated banks and trusts, leading a week later to the downfall of the Knickerbocker Trust Company&mdash;New York City's third-largest trust. The collapse of the Knickerbocker spread fear throughout the city's trusts as regional banks withdrew reserves from New York City banks. Panic extended across the nation as vast numbers of people withdrew deposits from their regional banks.<br/><br/>The panic might have deepened if not for the intervention of financier J. P. Morgan, who pledged large sums of his own money, and convinced other New York bankers to do the same, to shore up the banking system. At the time, the United States did not have a central bank to inject liquidity back into the market. By November, the financial contagion had largely ended, only to be replaced by a further crisis. This was due to the heavy borrowing of a large brokerage firm that used the stock of Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TC&amp;I) as collateral. Collapse of TC&amp;I's stock price was averted by an emergency takeover by Morgan's U.S. Steel Corporation&mdash;a move approved by anti-monopolist president Theodore Roosevelt. The following year, Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., established and chaired a commission to investigate the crisis and propose future solutions, leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.<br/> <p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/mission.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   According to the Fed's own web site  </a> </u> , the Fed sees its mission as falling into the following areas:</p><li> conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing the monetary and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates</li><li> supervising and regulating banking institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers</li><li> maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets</li><li> providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions, including playing a major role in operating the nation's payments system <br/>  </li><p> It's interesting that the Fed sees maximum employment (and stable prices) as within its purview. It's not clear to me that the Fed has anything but the most contrived, indirect, strained \"control\" over the nation's job market, but apparently on November 16, 1977, the Federal Reserve Act was amended to require the Board and the  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee\" target=\"_blank\">   Federal Open Market Committee  </a> </u>  \"to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" Hence the first bullet point. <br/> <br/> We can probably agree that the Fed's main purpose is to keep the banking system sound. It does this through a variety of policies (involving reserve requirements, key interest rates, and open-market actions) collectively known as monetary policy. <br/> <br/> The Fed has other duties, including the collection and analysis of economic data. It seems to be okay at collecting data, but no better than mediocre at analyzing it. (Some would say mediocre is being kind.) <br/> <br/> Forty years ago, when the U.S. economy was facing serious inflation and a wage-price spiral, the Fed was able to \"put the brakes on\" the economy by adjusting key interest rates upward. In 2008, the economy ground to a halt, and the Fed found out very quickly that it could not speed the economy up by lowering interest rates (even to zero). Instead, the Fed had to go to a liquidity-based pseudo-stimulus plan called QE ( <u>  <a href=\"http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2015/06/quantitative-easing-is-evil.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   quantitative easing  </a> </u> ), which stimulated the only part of the economy it has direct influence over: the banking industry. As it happens, the vast amounts of money created in support of QE (a little over $4 trillion) mostly went to bond and mortgage buybacks that led to banks bolstering their reserves. It mostly didn't have the intended effect of stimulating borrowing, and in the low interest rate, easy-money environment of the last few years, most large coproations have used their money not to expand their core businesses (which would have meant hiring people) but to buy back stock. We see the effect of QE mainly in high stock prices (and low mortgage rates), not in hiring or economic expansion, which is why I called it a pseudo-stimulus. Defenders of the Fed would say that without QE, we'd now be in a very deep recession, but the question is whether we've prevented that scenario or merely delayed it. Common sense says that monetary stimulus (which can only be about borrowing) is not true stimulus. You can't borrow your way to prosperity if the economy isn't truly growing organically in the first place. (Which it's not.) <br/> <br/> In the UK, there's been  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2015/03/12/how-green-infrastructure-quantitative-easing-would-work/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   some talk recently of green QE  </a> </u> , which is the idea of funding infrastructure projects by bonds that would be bought back under QE.  <u>  <a href=\"http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2011/09/new-name-for-old-game_30.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Some have criticized this idea  </a> </u>  based on the fact that green QE conflates fiscal policy (which tends to be agenda-based) with monetary policy. However, monetary policy is arguably already conflated with fiscal policy, inasmuch as traditional QE's \"stimulus formula\" is agenda-based, with a definite sector bias (toward finance and housing). The question of whether QE should now favor other sectors and other agendas is a fair one. Many people would argue (convincingly, I think) that we're already expecting monetary policy to do too much. <br/> <br/> The reason we lean so heavily now on monetary policy (Fed action; QE) is the lack of tolerance in Washington (and London and elsewhere) for real public policy decision-making. Fiscal policy decisions (decisions involving taxing and spending) have become too difficult, politically. It's not just that our leaders are cowards; it's that contentiousness has paralyzed government. It takes a full-blown crisis now to get anything done. And more often than not, the will of the people is ignored. (For example, the overwhelming majority of Americans  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/149567/Americans-Favor-Jobs-Plan-Proposals-Including-Taxing-Rich.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   favor taxing the rich more aggressively  </a> </u> ; but this isn't likely to happen while the rich are pulling the strings.) <br/> <br/> My take? Looking to the Fed (or to monetary policy generally) for answers is a form of denial. We need to confront our problems head-on and demand real solutions, not QE-based wishful-thinking non-solutions that favor banks and landlords, exacerbating the wealth-inequality problem. We need to start dealing with real issues (job creation, opportunity, the need for high wages, less student loan debt, etc.) now, before the next crisis happens. The Fed didn't prevent the Great Depression. It's not going to prevent the next depression. We need to redeploy real, existing wealth, now, in ways that make the economy stronger for everyone, so that we don't have to invent whatever comes after the Fed, after whatever disaster comes next.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 18:36:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 18:36:16.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_hYbZLzJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-do-we-care-so-much-about-the-fed/\", \"post_id\": \"5235\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 18:36:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 18:36:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-do-we-care-so-much-about-the-fed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5234\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2365\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Federal_Reserve.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1371\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438857900,"author_id":263,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2315,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Great CEOs Roll With the Punches","link":"great-ceos-roll-with-the-punches","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Every day we see or read about superb acts of leadership. The ones that occupy an indelible place in our minds are often characterized by unexpected high-pressure, traumatic conditions and courageous acts taken within a very limited amount of time &ndash; a cabbie delivering a baby, a mayor calming a city after one of the worst terrorist attack in the history of mankind, a pilot making the call to land a powerless 65 ton piece of steel on a river in the middle of a major metropolis, a primary school teacher shielding her little ones from a gun-wielding madman. </p><p> With the exception of tampered product recalls, oil spills, or factory explosions, these types of trials never face the captains of industry. Am I implying that leading a business enterprise is easy? Not in the least. But in the context of taking charge and leading human beings during major or minor crises, every chief executive is blessed with the luxuries of time, subordinate counsel, years of related experience, and knowhow imparted by pundits in thousands of books, journals and case studies.</p><p> So, why do 21st century CEOs continue to struggle in their roles as leaders of a business enterprise? Consider this:  The Conference Board reports that the average tenure of a CEO in America is 8.4 years, down from 10.0 years in 2000. According to the Board&rsquo;s study, dismissals were on the rise because of increased accountability of directors and a greater scrutiny from shareholders and activists. The Conference Board suggests that the pressure of serving as the CEO of a large company in an increasingly competitive global marketplace has resulted in more voluntarily shorter tenures, implying that CEOs are leaving on their own terms after fewer years on the job. This is a case of &ldquo;jump&rdquo; before you are &ldquo;pushed.&rdquo;</p><p> Is the tenure problem attributable to leadership itself, impatient shareholders, uncontrollable external factors or a combination of all three? Blaming shareholders is a cop-out. The moment shareholders lose confidence in their chief executive, he or she is toast. A critical role of an organization&rsquo;s leader is to generate and communicate business progress to all stakeholders. Sometimes that headway doesn&rsquo;t show up on the profit line of the income statement. Progress may be represented by top-line sales, market share, productivity, innovation, new product launches, or expanding distribution. These factors can be the determinants of the organization&rsquo;s strategic well-being. Strategic health ultimately results in profit. But profit can also be the worse indicator of a company&rsquo;s strategic health. Look at any business with increasing profits and declining or stagnating sales; below the shining profit fa&ccedil;ade is a deep-rooted problem.</p><p> In judging CEO performance, there is no place for the uncontrollable factor. Chief Executives are paid handsomely to deal with sick economies and currency fluctuations. CEO&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t expected to change the world, but they sure as hell can affect how their companies deal with negatives that ostensibly are beyond their control. Over my 17-year career in the North American coffee business, I must have dealt with three or four Brazilian frosts that pushed the price of coffee futures through the roof. Most of the lessons learned were from the errors the executive team made in the first frost that almost put us out of business. After that calamity, we altered our course to make the best of a difficult situation and always came out of the frost in much better shape than our competition. You do not throw your hands in the air and tell the shareholders to wait for prices to stabilize.</p><p> Back to my question &ndash; who to blame for lackluster CEO performance? Though I have no statistical evidence to support my theory, I place most of the blame on leadership itself. Great leadership begins in the interview process. Those keen to secure the job and the big paycheck over-sell and over-promise. Astute leaders establish the right expectations and continue to manage those expectations in the battlefield. These CEOs deal with uncontrollable issues as the norm, and they have a better shot at a longer tenure &ndash; if they want it. In the late 19th century, someone said, &ldquo;When the going gets tough, the tough get going.&rdquo; Today&rsquo;s successful CEOs have little choice but to walk that talk.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 18:31:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 18:31:40.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_fAgnsWP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/great-ceos-roll-with-the-punches/\", \"post_id\": \"5233\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 18:31:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 18:31:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"great-ceos-roll-with-the-punches\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5232\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2364\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/boxing-gloves.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"408\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438861500,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2314,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Life Insurance Basics: How to Choose the Right Policy","link":"life-insurance-basics-how-to-choose-the-right-policy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Raymond Caucci | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pennmutual\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Penn Mutual  </u> </a></p><p> When it comes time to purchase a life insurance policy, people often get overwhelmed by the number of choices available. It&rsquo;s actually a good thing there are so many different types of life insurance: Everyone&rsquo;s life is different, and even then, people&rsquo;s needs change over the course of their lives.</p><p> I&rsquo;d like to cover some of the basics of life insurance and explain the different types of policies available and what ones might be useful under what circumstances. There are basically two different types of life insurance: Term insurance and permanent insurance. Beyond that, there are several different types of permanent insurance.</p><h3> Term Life Insurance</h3><p> <br/> Term insurance provides a death benefit for a set number of years, usually ten, fifteen, or twenty years. Permanent life insurance provides a death benefit for a person&rsquo;s entire life, and it also builds cash value. The comparison between renting or owning a home is apt: Term life insurance is like renting a home, while permanent life insurance is like owning a home. Renting can be cheaper in the short run, but you never build up equity in the home. Owning can be cheaper in the long run, and you have access to all the equity in the home.</p><p> While companies like Penn Mutual rightly champion the importance of permanent coverage, many folks start out by buying term insurance, just as they often start of renting rather than buying their home. Part of that is if they&rsquo;re fixated only on protection, and term life insurance is an inexpensive form of temporary protection.</p><p> As situations and priorities change, a policyholder can convert that term insurance to permanent coverage without having to provide evidence of insurability. In effect, they&rsquo;ve locked in their insurability when they bought the term, as long as they convert before the end of the term period. The permanent coverage will cost more than term, but it provides additional benefits that term cannot.</p><h3> Permanent Life Insurance</h3><p> <br/> Permanent life insurance combines the protection of the death benefit while building cash value that can be accessed throughout a person&rsquo;s life for whatever they need it for. It is, as we say, for protection and possibilities.</p><p> Employers encourage people to put anywhere from four to eight percent of their salary into a 401K. A permanent policy can function much the same way. People should look at life insurance as a way to provide protection plusa savings element &mdash; not as a bill or a cost but more as an opportunity to put money in a vehicle that not only provides protection but also accessible cash value that can be used at any time. That outlook transforms the story away from, &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s an expensive insurance policy&rdquo; to &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s an interesting vehicle that has the elements of life insurance protection plus cash value with growth on a tax deferred basis.&rdquo;</p><p> With this perspective, life insurance suddenly becomes something more powerful. It&rsquo;s not a pure investment. It&rsquo;s not a pension or a defined contribution plan like a 401K, but it&rsquo;s a hybrid of a protection vehicle that will provide a death benefit along with the ability to accumulate cash value that you can access when you need it.</p><h3> The Different Types of Permanent Life Insurance</h3><p> <br/> Penn Mutual offers a wide variety of products tailored to the client&rsquo;s tolerance for market volatility in the accumulation of cash value. The four basic types of permanent life insurance are whole life, universal life (UL), indexed universal life (indexed UL) and variable universal life (VUL). The Penn Mutual website has a great overview on  <u>  how to choose the right life insurance </u> . There you will find this chart, which arranges the four life insurance options according to risk tolerance (from low risk tolerance to high) and growth potential (from guaranteed to market-based growth).</p><p> <img alt=\"Choosing the right life insurance\" src=\"http://blog.pennmutual.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Choosing-the-Right-Life-Insurance.png\"/></p><p> At the one end of the spectrum, whole life has guaranteed cash value. As long as you pay your premium and regardless of what happens with market interest rates, you get an increasing amount of guaranteed cash value each year.</p><p> If you go to the other side of the chart, for variable universal life, you have no guaranteed cash value, but you have potential for tremendous upside if the bond or equity markets perform well, where you could generate more cash value in that product than any of the other three. The tradeoff for that is you have limited, or no downside protection. Indexed UL and UL fit in between those two extremes.</p><p> It comes down to how comfortable you are with market volatility impacting the growth in the cash value of your life insurance. If you&rsquo;re highly concerned about it, then whole life might be the product you choose. If you are willing to risk the possibility that your cash value might decrease for some periods of time in exchange for the potential of a large upside, then variable UL would be the choice. With variable universal life, you get to choose what funds to allocate your premiums from those offered by Penn Mutual.</p><p> If you are the sort of person who likes social proof for their decisions, I can tell you the product we sell the most of is whole life. In order of popularity, it&rsquo;s whole life, indexed UL, UL, term and then variable UL.</p><p> Penn Mutual strives to provide a range of life insurance products that can meet any need. I invite you to contact your financial advisor to learn more about choosing the right life insurance for your situation.</p><p> Insurance Products Are: Not FDIC insured, may lose value, not bank guaranteed, not a deposit and not insured by any federal government entity. This article should not be construed as a recommendation for your personal situation and you should talk to a licensed professional before taking any action.</p><p> Life insurance policies contain exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force. Accessing cash values may result in surrender fees and charges, may require additional premium payments to maintain coverage, and will reduce the death benefit and policy values. Loans are income tax free as long as policy is not a &ldquo;modified endowment contract&rdquo; (MEC) and policy must not be surrendered, lapsed, or otherwise terminated during the lifetime of the insured. Policy must not be a modified endowment contract (MEC) and withdrawals must not exceed cost basis. Partial withdrawals during the first 15 policy years are subject to additional rules and may be taxable. Excess policy loans can result in termination of a policy. A policy that lapses or is surrendered can potentially result in tax consequences. You should consult a qualified tax professional for tax advice on your own personal situation. All guarantees are based upon the claims-paying ability of the issuer.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 18:24:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 18:24:45.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_V3nQlht.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/life-insurance-basics-how-to-choose-the-right-policy/\", \"post_id\": \"5231\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 18:24:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 18:24:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"life-insurance-basics-how-to-choose-the-right-policy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5230\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2363\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438716033116-95be311c82b7-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1623\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438864200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2313,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Steps to a Healthy Ecosystem for Your Business","link":"5-steps-to-a-healthy-ecosystem-for-your-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The earth is covered in ecosystems, each a complex natural relationship between the plants, animals, microorganisms and their natural environment. Wetlands, rainforests, prairies and ponds &hellip; regardless of the type of environment, in all healthy, biodiverse ecosystems each living organism is interconnected.</p><p> When ecosystems function as a unit they maintain balance in all these relationships, are healthy and sustainable. When they do not &ndash; or when some external force throws them out of balance &ndash; they suffer, and sometimes die.</p><p> It is the same in business. Whether you recognize it or not, your company has its own natural ecosystem.</p><p> Consider the oyster: oyster reefs once covered more than 220,000 acres of the Hudson River estuary in New York Harbor. They were valuable participants in their ecosystem. One oyster filters over 50 gallons of water a day and they (and their shells) provide a habitat for other marine species. (They are also delicious, but that&rsquo;s another subject entirely.)</p><p> Over time, oysters in New York harbor became functionally extinct due to over-harvesting, pollution and dredging. The result? &ldquo;The absence of oysters has impaired our estuary&rsquo;s ability to clean the water and absorb excess nitrogen; the loss of reefs has reduced protective habitat, destabilized the sea floor and left our shoreline vulnerable to destructive wave action,&rdquo; reports the researchers at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.billionoysterproject.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Billion Oyster Project  </a> </u>  who are working to restore oysters to their rightful place in harbor&rsquo;s ecology.</p><p> Now consider your own ecosystem: your company&rsquo;s culture. A business culture is no less complex and fragile. Small changes can throw it out of balance and some changes can happen slowly over time and be almost imperceptible to the naked eye, like growing pollution in the water. Even overuse of strengths can do great harm, as NY found as they over-harvested their oysters. Company cultures are like ecosystems in one other important way: each is unique, with a different balance necessary for every culture and different solutions needed when things go awry.</p><p> To ensure you maintain a healthy and sustainable Cultural Ecosystem, be intentional and don&rsquo;t leave it to chance.</p><p> Follow these five steps:</p><p> 1.  <strong>  Explore </strong>  &ndash; consider why your Cultural Ecosystem exists, and what makes it different from others. Natural ecosystems just &lsquo;are&rsquo; but business ecosystems are built (albeit sometimes unconsciously). What is your company&rsquo;s purpose? What are you here to do? Why are you unique? By understanding your company&rsquo;s purpose, mission, vision and values you will be able to gauge whether the ecosystem is working in healthy ways to realize this purpose, or is being thwarted.</p><p> 2.  <strong>  Study </strong>  &ndash; dedicate time to observe your ecosystem and understand how it works. What are the complex natural relationships that exist within it? What does proper bio-diversity look like to achieve health in your organization? How do the different people, systems and processes work together to keep it healthy?</p><p> 3.  <strong>  Assess </strong>  &ndash; evaluate your culture&rsquo;s health, scientifically and objectively. Examine (or if necessary, introduce) opinion surveys, look at retention numbers and exit interview data. Interview employees and leaders at all levels to understand the culture and determine what is producing results, and what is getting in the way. How have the things you have introduced &ndash; like HR policies, compensation and recognition programs or organization design changes &ndash; impacted your ecosystem? Where are behaviors or dysfunctions damaging it?</p><p> 4.  <strong>  Balance </strong>  &ndash; take steps to put the ecosystem back in balance. Use what you have learned to seek support from your leadership team to create real change, for themselves and their teams. Commit to making changes in people, programs and process and be discipled about enforcing your purpose and values. Don&rsquo;t be reluctant to make bold changes.</p><p> 5.  <strong>  Protect </strong>  &ndash; devote resources (both human and otherwise) to be responsible for protecting the ecosystem, and give them permission to sound the call when something is out of balance. Be vigilant and continuously explore your ecosystem to monitor its health. At least yearly, pledge to follow these steps &ndash; study, assess, balance and protect &ndash; to maintain a healthy Cultural Ecosystem.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 18:16:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 18:16:13.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_QXWu2eU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-steps-to-a-healthy-ecosystem-for-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"5229\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 18:16:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 18:16:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-steps-to-a-healthy-ecosystem-for-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5228\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2362\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/night-sky-hd-wallpaper-2.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1301\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438873200,"author_id":53,"chart_url":""}

Enough of all of this selfless service, the &lsquo;always putting everyone else first&rsquo; BS, it is time to put you first as a leader. Now, before you call your local Goodie Two-Shoes outfit and have me tarred and feathered, let me explain.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Merriam-Webster Dictionary  </a> </u>  defines  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/selfish\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   selfish  </a> </u>  as, &ldquo;Having or showing concern only for yourself and not the needs or feelings of other people.&rdquo;</p><p> Sounds like to be a selfish leader would be a bad thing, right, showing concern only for yourself, but not for your team? What about those around you? They should be the focus, that&rsquo;s what we have been told. We have been taught that a real leader is someone who is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/selfless\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   selfless  </a> </u> , which according to Merriam-Webster again, means, &ldquo;Having or showing great concern for other people and little or no concern for yourself.&rdquo;</p><p> There is a problem with this thinking though. Over time, if you consistently put the needs of others in front of your own, the results will not be sustainable, as there will be little of you left to lead, you will burn out. We know this through the study of human behavior and of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.croftandcompany.com/need-leaders-flow/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Flow  </a> </u> . Flow is the state of ultimate performance when we feel our best and perform our best.  <u>  <a href=\"http://openfor.business/2015/07/do-you-experience-flow-as-a-leader/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Flow follows a predictable cycle  </a> </u> <a href=\"http://openfor.business/2015/07/do-you-experience-flow-as-a-leader/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  , </a>  which in the last phase, Recovery, we find the need to put ourselves first.</p><p> How about a different focus then? What about Self-First Leadership? What about putting your wellness, health, and needs first so that you have the expanded capacity and abilities to show up as a leader for others for the long run? If you are exhausted, mentally hammered, or spiritually drained you will not be an effective leader of others. The ideal is balance &ndash; what if you could be both a selfish leader and a selfless leader? To be a successful leader, you have to make the time for yourself so that you can then clearly perceive the needs of your team, and have the focus and energy to properly address those needs. Knowing when to stop and put your needs in front is how to recover &ndash; so you can create Flow for yourself going forward. Need some ideas on how to do it? Here you go:</p><p> <strong>  Exercise </strong>  &ndash; What&rsquo;s good for the body is good for the brain &ndash; a better you all around. A strong and healthy body gives you energy and endurance for long tough days. Plus, exercise increases Flow enhancing neuro-chemicals such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and anandamide, which give us the feel good effect from working out.</p><p> <strong>  Sleep </strong>  &ndash; Recovery is key to Flow, and if we do not get enough sleep we will soon be out of gas and unable to go the distance. Research continues to show that for the average adult 7-8 hours of sleep per night is critical to create Flow moments during the day.</p><p> <strong>  Spiritual Health </strong>  &ndash; Whatever your spiritual beliefs, making the time for some contemplation of life&rsquo;s purpose or meaning can be super powerful in helping you recover mentally and emotionally and find Flow. A meditative practice, time spent in nature, or meaningful volunteering can all serve as spiritual care, so you can then care for others.</p><p> <strong>  Healthy Relationships </strong>  &ndash; Who refills your batteries? Hanging out and relaxing with those who build you up and bring out the best in you can help you become a leader for the long run. Allowing yourself to unwind with those who mean much to you is a great way to recover for your next challenge as a leader.</p><p> <strong>  A Selfish Hobby </strong>  &ndash; What do you do just for you? Is it gardening? Scrapbooking? Woodworking? Or fly-fishing? Whatever it is, do it, and do it on a regular basis. These times of active and engaged relaxation actually will help you recover and you are very likely to find Flow happening during this time.</p><p> So, it is time to become a Self-First leader. Your team needs it, your organization needs it, and most importantly, you need it. So go get some exercise, some sleep, or do your favorite hobby. As for me, I am going to quit writing and either go for a run, go out to my woodshed, or maybe it is naptime&hellip;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 18:07:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 18:07:33.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_fhVUdgi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-a-selfish-or-self-first-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"5227\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 18:07:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 18:07:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-a-selfish-or-self-first-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5226\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2361\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Selfish-Scales-800x390.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"655\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438880400,"author_id":120,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2311,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"To Connect Intuitively & Emotionally With Customers, Think Like A Caveman","link":"to-connect-intuitively-emotionally-with-customers-think-like-a-caveman","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilygdell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Emily Dell  </a> </u> | <a href=\"http://www.blissintegrated.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bliss Integrated Communication  </u> </a>  </p><p> Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in a webinar, &ldquo; <u>  Is Your Brand in Sync with What the Brain Wants? </u> &rdquo; which focused on how brands can intuitively and emotionally connect with customers to form long-lasting, engaging bonds.</p><p> The most powerful lesson learned from the webinar is how humans today make decisions about the brands they purchase from or partner with is similar to our ancient ancestors . Not relying on rationality, the primal parts of humans&rsquo; brains, which process 11 million bits per second, are where 90 percent of all decisions are made. Only 10 percent of decisions are made by the rationale portion of the brain.</p><p> To infiltrate potential and current customers&rsquo; subconscious to become the preferred choice, companies must create memorable experiences that appeal to buyers&rsquo; most primal senses. To do this, companies should consider tapping into the following primal instincts that help to engage customers&rsquo; subconscious and steer them toward &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; and away from &lsquo;no':</p><li> <strong>  Survival of the most authentic.  </strong> For our ancient ancestors, survival was everything. And it is for us too&mdash;but our battle is different. Instead of saber-toothed tigers, our enemies can be corporate giants selling false promises. To protect ourselves from deceitful brands, we use the same receptors our predecessors did. So how do companies avoid alerting these built-in credibility detectors? It&rsquo;s three-fold. Organize around a meaningful purpose, be trustworthy, and, most importantly, be authentic. For example, sharing personal employee stories, from what inspires them to why they love working for the company, via social media can help build the company&rsquo;s authenticity score.</li><li> <strong>  Seeing is believing. </strong>  Vision takes up half of the brain&rsquo;s resources, and, as humans, we process first with sight. In fact, our brains process pictures 60,000 times faster than text. According to Dr.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brainrules.net/about-the-author\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John Medina  </a> </u> , a developmental molecular biologist and affiliate Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Washington School of Medicine, &ldquo;We are incredible at remembering pictures. Hear a piece of information, and three days later you&rsquo;ll remember 10% of it. Add a picture and you&rsquo;ll remember 65%.&rdquo; Brands should consider using more pictures than text to tell their stories. Apple is a great example of this, in that the company relies heavily on emotive visuals, not text, in its marketing.</li><li> <strong>  Consistency is key. </strong>  Routine rules, especially since humans are creatures of comfort. Brands offering the most consistent experiences are more likely to be market leaders. Consistent engagement with a brand psychologically creates positive reinforcement for customers. As humans, we are driven to do business because we are architects of memories, not messages. If companies create consistent and positive memorable experiences for those who interact with their brand, they will generate long-term customer satisfaction.</li><li> <strong>  Rely on rituals and rites. </strong>  We all desire to connect and belong. In pre-historic times, if you weren&rsquo;t part of a tribe, you most likely would not survive. Brands that are capable of building a sense of community through the use of rituals will reap the reward of happy customers. Brands that include a ritual in their experiences are also able to more easily involve their customers and give them a sense of belonging to their community. This can lead to customers sharing their participation in these rituals with their own personal communities via social media, thereby endorsing the company. For example, Tupperware took advantage of the fact that the majority of its customers partake in the Monday night ritual of weekly meal prep. The brand created  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mealprepmondays.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meal Prep Mondays  </a> </u>  and invited families to photograph and post their meal prep to the company&rsquo;s Instagram channel to create a sense of community and belonging.</li><li> <strong>  Engage the senses.  </strong> To grab as much real estate as possible in customers&rsquo; subconscious, companies should consider tapping into the five senses, especially scent. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, for example, includes scent in its in-store experience. Even Samsung and Sony are scenting their lobbies because they understand how important aroma is in creating and leaving an impression. Music is also a powerful tool for creating a feel-good connection with customers. It can also act as a brand&rsquo;s calling card. For example, when the CEO walks on stage to deliver a presentation, is there appropriate intro music that can be used to immediately create an emotional connection with the audience? Creating this calling card for the CEO helps, and will hopefully recreate the success of how Monday Night Football uses its music to excite viewers. Through using unique scents, sounds and even colors (think GE blue), brands are able to create multisensory experiences.</li><li> <strong>  Show novelty.  </strong> Since survival was top of mind for our ancestors, they were always scanning their surrounding environments for threats or dangers. This behavior has stuck with us today as we are pre-wired to be aware of change. This makes it critical for companies to stay within existing brand equities, while simultaneously updating and refreshing to remain relevant. Starbucks is a master at this. The company is always innovating its menus, products and services, but it&rsquo;s always on brand. Failing to update and stay relevant, customers may move to a competitor more capable of being true to itself as well as modern.</li><li> <strong>  The proof is in the pudding. </strong> While our irrational brains make most of our decisions, it is in constant connection with our more rationale selves. So while we may derive pleasure when we instantly walk into a Chipotle because of the design and smell of the food thanks to the primal portion of our brain, the rationale part of the brain takes into account the brand&rsquo;s sustainable sourcing practices. For brands to successfully market, they must make customers aware of the brand&rsquo;s proof points. By doing so, companies are more likely to secure a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; from both the rational and irrational portions of consumers&rsquo; brains. <br/>  </li><p> The majority of the time, customers can&rsquo;t help but to decide about a brand in a blink of an eye.</p><p> Is your brand ready? Remember, all you have to do to market your brand successfully is think like a caveman.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 17:57:50.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 17:57:50.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_K0V6Xrr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/to-connect-intuitively-emotionally-with-customers-think-like-a-caveman/\", \"post_id\": \"5225\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 17:57:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 17:57:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"to-connect-intuitively-emotionally-with-customers-think-like-a-caveman\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5224\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2360\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/caveman.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1237\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438888500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2310,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Art of Saying No in Business","link":"the-art-of-saying-no-in-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Saying no, whether to your boss, to your team, or to a client, can be an awkward and uncomfortable endeavor. However, whether for your own personal sanity or for the effective completion of your current efforts, saying no is sometimes necessary in business. Yet Consider the following tips to say no artfully while still contributing to the productivity of your workplace:</p><h3> Understand the request</h3><p> Before saying no, ask for clarity. Whereas often time we see our obligation to a request as larger than it is, other times the requestor does not fully grasp the magnitude of what he or she is truly asking. Before determining your decision, be sure that clear communication regarding what the goal of the request is, as well as how it will be met, are understood by all parties involved.</p><h3> Ensure validity</h3><p> There are some tasks we just don&rsquo;t want to complete, and others are simply out of our comfort zone. A no that is perceived as &ldquo;just because&rdquo; can decrease trust in you as a businessperson, can weaken current or potential relationships, and can even limit your own growth in a company. Ensure that your reason for saying no really is justified, and include validity for your &ldquo;no&rdquo; in your explanation.</p><h3> Define your boundaries</h3><p> It is important to know and set your own boundaries so that you are not overwhelmed and so that you can competently and effectively complete that which is required of you. Once your boundaries are determined, you should communicate and adhere to them to that when requests come your way, you are not perceived as unreasonable or unwilling.</p><h3> Weigh the benefits</h3><p> What are you giving up and what opportunity could you be gaining? Ensuring that the reasons for &ldquo;no&rdquo; outweigh those for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; can lessen your own personal guilt and give you confidence, both in confirming your decision and in setting future boundaries.</p><h3> Offer context</h3><p> Without relaying every last detail, your &ldquo;no&rdquo; should offer your valid reason to the requestor; no is much better received when the constraints that you are facing are relayed. Whether time, budget, or competitive restraints, include enough information in your explanation that you are not perceived you as smug, bothered, or unwilling to partner and engage.</p><h3> Include positive in your negative</h3><p> As you say no, see the requestor as a human being with a reasonable appeal. While saying no, be sure to explain how positively you feel about the individual making the request so that he or she feels like you are not saying no to the person, but rather to the possibility of fulfilling the task.</p><h3> Be clear</h3><p> Do not waver in saying no. Once you have determined the importance of saying no, clearly communicate that there is not a possibility for you to honor the request. You can do this politely and professionally, but being strong in your conviction is a must.</p><p> Is there any reason you aren&rsquo;t able to now say &ldquo;no&rdquo;? No? Great! That was the answer we were looking for.</p><p> Photo credit:   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.chrisjoelcampbell.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chris Joel Campbell  </a> </u></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 17:51:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 17:51:53.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_YBx8hKD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-art-of-saying-no-in-business/\", \"post_id\": \"5223\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 17:51:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 17:51:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-art-of-saying-no-in-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5222\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2359\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438763298591-75a0d42b7265.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"618\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438889400,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

Gather your team together for a focused hour and talk about the questions below, and then build your plan. It&rsquo;s helpful to revisit the strategy once a month to see how it&rsquo;s working and determine if anything needs to be revised.<h3> 7 Questions to Improve Your Team's Communication</h3>&ldquo;The single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has taken place.\"-George Bernard Shaw<h3> 1. What's Working/Not Working?</h3>Start with the basics.<li> What is working well about the way we are currently communicating?</li><li> Where is co​mmunication breaking down?</li><li> What do we need to be talking about more? Less?</li><h3> 2. Who Are Our Stakeholders and What Do They Care About?</h3>Giving your stakeholders the right amount of information how and when they want it reduces their anxiety and gets them off your back. And let&rsquo;s face it, when you stay in front of the need-to-know curve, you look smart.If you don&rsquo;t know what your boss (or her boss) really wants to know&ndash;ask. Also if you produce and distribute reports and updates, it&rsquo;s often wise to ask who&rsquo;s looking at them. I knew one manager who just stopped sending all the mandatory reports his team was producing for three months, and no one noticed! I&rsquo;m not suggesting this approach, but a quick check-in may save you some valuable time.<h3> 3. What More Information Do You Need From Me?</h3>Start with you to ensure you&rsquo;re giving the team everything they need. Then it&rsquo;s good to go around the room and have everyone ask this question. Be sure you&rsquo;re clear on what you need from each team member and what they need from one another.<h3> 4. How Will We Use Email?</h3>If you haven&rsquo;t talked about this explicitly, I&rsquo;m sure there are <u> strategies you could use to be more impactful</u>.<h3> 5. When Will We Meet (In Person or by Phone) and Why?</h3>Every meeting should have a purpose (tied to improving results or relationships). If the purpose of some of your meetings is simply to update, brainstorm alternative communication strategies.<h3> 6. How Will We Ensure Our Meetings are Effective?</h3>Talk about the best way to monitor meeting effectiveness <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/results-execution/meetings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> ( <u>  see meeting NPS </u></a>). Do you start each meeting with clear objectives and desired outcomes? Do you stick to the agenda? Are action items clearly documented with responsible parties and follow-up dates?<h3> 7. How Will We Resolve Conflict?</h3>Talking about how you&rsquo;ll address conflict and disagreements before you have one can go a long way in improving team dynamics. Agreeing in advance that you&rsquo;re open to feedback and the best way to deliver it will also help promote healthy dialogue. Introduce tools such as the <a href=\"https://letsgrowleaders.com/2014/11/10/set-clear-expectations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  expectations matrix </u>  </a>to help structure discussion.So many teams settle for good communication when it could be great. Or worse, assume miscommunication is just part of working in a team. Checking in on the process every now and then will reap huge dividends in future productivity.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 17:43:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 17:43:23.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_ZFOVK5L.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-questions-to-improve-your-teams-communication/\", \"post_id\": \"5221\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 17:43:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 17:43:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-questions-to-improve-your-teams-communication\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5220\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2358\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/be-a-better-communicator-featured-644x250.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1857\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438880400,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2308,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Key Documents You Need to Keep After the Death of a Spouse or Domestic Partner","link":"key-documents-you-need-to-keep-after-the-death-of-a-spouse-or-domestic-partner","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/estateassistus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Estate Assist  </u> </a></p><p> The passing of a spouse or domestic partner is a time of great turmoil, often aggravated by suddenness. When someone dies unexpectedly, at the peak of their career, it comes as a surprise and shock for everyone.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/05/dave-goldberg-death-the-result-of-head-trauma-while-exercising/26875183/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The tragic loss of David Goldberg, husband to Facebook&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg  </a> </u> , is a reminder that none of us are exempt from loss. All we can do is always exercise due diligence and keep our affairs in order, to make sure our loved ones are cared for when we are no longer around.</p><p> <u>  If you died today, would your affairs be in order? Learn more </u> .</p><p> Unfortunately, a high percentage of adults often fail to take the basic steps necessary for handling their personal, financial, and professional affairs before their passing. In fact, many widows and widowers often find themselves scrambling for information and documents, trying to discriminate as to what is important and what is not as essential. If this is your situation and you are trying to figure out the next steps as you sort through personal files, both digital and in print, then we want to give you some basic guidelines to get you started. You may not be able to pull off a perfect transition, but having a basic understanding of what documents you are likely to need will certainly help make things easier.</p><h3> Login and Password Keychain</h3><p> If your spouse or partner had a  <u>  digital safe deposit box </u>  or a shared folder for important documents, then spend a little time reviewing the content. With luck, you may locate a login and password master list. This list can prove useful in accessing digital assets such as frequent-flier miles, iTunes, bank accounts, and social media accounts. This document will prove useful when dealing with practical affairs, and it will also help you in the healing process by providing you access to social settings such as Facebook, allowing you to save precious memories to a different and more durable file.</p><h3> Keep Multiple Copies of the Death Certificate</h3><p> Generally speaking, the funeral director takes care of filing the death certificate. You should be able to request multiple copies from the Office of Vital Records. A death certificate will prove useful in closing and transferring accounts. You will also need it if your spouse or domestic partner died intestate, in order to complete the process of probate. Keep in mind that many organizations, such as banks, will require a &ldquo;certified&rdquo; copy. Make certain you pay for the certification stamps when requesting copies of the certificate.</p><h3> Find and Keep Insurance-Policies Documents</h3><p> Use common sense when searching for important documents. Most people keep a filing cabinet or fireproof box. If you are unable to locate certificates or documents that support the existence of life insurance policies, then you may want to contact their employer to see if there were any policies included in the deceased&rsquo;s benefit package. Another great resource to locate potentially missing policies is the State Insurance Department. You can find contact information for each office  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.naic.org/state_web_map.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Marriage Certificate or Evidence of Domestic Partnership</h3><p> In order to process many of the benefits available to survivors, and to secure the right to represent the assets of your deceased spouse, you will need to prove that you were married. This is particularly important if your spouse dies without a will and without having assigned a trustee or executor.</p><h3> Documents Related to Taxes</h3><p> Chances are you or the executor will need to file taxes for the deceased. This may also include inheritance taxes. Make sure you do not discard receipts or other transactional documents that may aid in filing their final tax return.</p><h3> Military Discharge Papers</h3><p> If your spouse served in the military, then you may be entitled to a variety of benefits. If you don&rsquo;t have a copy of his or her military discharge papers, then you can request one from the Department of Defense Personnel Records Office. Also, contact the Department of Veteran Affairs to better understand any benefits you may be entitled to receive as a widow or widower.</p><h3> Social Security Card</h3><p> If you don&rsquo;t know their social security number by heart, then chances are you will need to figure it out. There are endless agencies that will need this information from you in order to finalize asset transfers or help you close accounts. You may also be entitled to a variety of benefits, some now and some later in life, as you reach retirement age.</p><h3> Bearer Bonds</h3><p> This is very important. Bearer bonds are not registered to the company or agency issuing the bonds; thus, the principal and interest associated with the bond can only be cashed by presenting the actual bond. Be careful not to discard these documents. They are as good as cash, and there are many heartbreaking stories of fortunes lost to poor record keeping.</p><p> We know this is a hard journey and encourage you to learn from it. If you are dealing with a scavenger hunt for documents after the death of your spouse, then make time to organize your own affairs in a way that reduces friction and stress, and helps your survivors find exactly what they need, when they need it.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 17:33:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 17:33:47.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_ayCIFzL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/key-documents-you-need-to-keep-after-the-death-of-a-spouse-or-domestic-partner/\", \"post_id\": \"5219\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 17:33:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 17:33:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"key-documents-you-need-to-keep-after-the-death-of-a-spouse-or-domestic-partner\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5218\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2357\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lp_importantdocs_img.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2283\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438866000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

A new study released earlier this month joins the pile of research documenting the educational impact of video games. Researchers at Queensland University in Australia studied eight- and nine-year-olds who play Minecraft. They found the students engaged in problem solving and creative thinking as they navigated its building block Lego-like worlds. Minecraft has been featured in  <u>  other studies </u>  as well showing the game teaches math and science.</p><p> In the 1980s, developers predicted that video games had applications as experiential learning tools. In 2010,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/magazine/19video-t.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   The New York Times  </a> </u>  profiled  <u>  Quest to Learn </u> , whose unusual teaching style included the use of video games in every classroom. Quest to Learn was home to the &ldquo;digital kid.&rdquo; Video games were incorporated into every aspect of learning; from geology and art to advanced math. Homework was a &ldquo;quest&rdquo; and grades had &ldquo;levels.&rdquo; In some cases, the assignment included video game design. Their quests featured multidisciplinary learning, incorporating English, math, and history into each assignment. </p><p> They must have been on to something. Fast-forward to 2015, where the school is not only still in operation but has expanded. Statewide test scores have remained consistent, and the school is ranked higher than 74.2% of the middle schools in the city.</p><p> Attracting top millennial talent could be as simple as engaging them in play. Could your company use the Internet and video gaming as a path to skills development and continual learning? If you can, you&rsquo;ll have this cadre of technology-savvy talent lined up outside your HR department before you can say &ldquo;YOLO.&rdquo;</p><h3> Broadcasting Live and in Your Cubicle</h3><p> <br/> Organizations can learn from the latest in business school education;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324769704579010481468363244\" target=\"_blank\">   MIT  </a> </u>  is teaching entrepreneurial skills through video gaming. In Cambridge, game simulations let students launch a new company and then see how those decisions evolve.</p><p> Businesses can apply this same idea by using computer games in the workplace to stimulate and teach real-world skills.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s something to consider: a common complaint about the digital era is its ability to distract. Today we&rsquo;re a lot like the dogs in the movie &ldquo;Up.&rdquo; Our smartphones are the digital equivalent of yelling &ldquo;Squirrel!&rdquo;</p><p> But could a video game teach us to concentrate? Have you ever sat down to play a video game and suddenly three hours have passed? Games force a narrowing of your attention. Each linear task requires singular focus taking you to the end of the level or game. Interestingly, an employee with the ability to concentrate on a task until completion is viewed as generally productive. So here a few more examples of how video games could be applied at work.</p><h3> World of Warcraft: World of Problem Solvers <br/>  </h3><p>   <img alt=\"tihms0sgg7tf6qdts9qj\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/tihms0sgg7tf6qdts9qj.gif?t=1438794785460&amp;width=411\"/> <br/> Video games are proven to help critical-thinking skills. In 2008, a researcher at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20080818/video-games-may-help-critical-thinking\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   University of Wisconsin-Madison  </a> </u>  studied 2,000 online posts about World of Warcraft. 86% of the posts were related to problem solving and critical thinking, knowledge sharing, and debate over the game. </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/videos/how-world-of-warcraft-could-save-your-business-and-the-economy-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John Seely Brown  </a> </u> , scholar and part of a Deloitte think tank, says he&rsquo;d hire a World of Warcraft expert over a Harvard MBA any day. He cites how the game is a collaboration of online gamers. To succeed, players join guilds of fighters who work together to solve problems. On any one night, Brown says 15,000 new strategic creative ideas are meshed together. To succeed, players have to sort through these ideas to develop a winning strategy for their game play.</p><p> Imagine how these skills could cross over into business and product development in the real world.</p><h3> Could SimCity Help Urban Planners? <br/>  </h3><br/>Taking this idea one step further, let&rsquo;s look at SimCity, that build-a-world simulation game. The game requires creative planning and problem solving, which has intriguing applications for urban planners:<li> <p>  Players evaluate foot traffic in a city block and must create ways to move urban dwellers from place to place </p></li><li> <p>  Traffic jams cause disruption, just like in real life, so players must consider expanding public transportation or other options in order to keep the city flowing smoothly </p></li><li> <p>  Gamers create green space. In the real world, green space is attractive to real estate developers. The city benefits from the additional taxes that come from economic development </p></li><h3> Could Video Games Cure Cancer?</h3><p> <br/> In 2013  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/cancer-research-uk-gamegene-cellslider-zooniverse-494318\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cancer Research UK  </a> </u>  released GameGene and CellSlider, smartphone apps that, under the guise of gaming, entice players to look at slides of real tissue samples and guess how many cancer cells are present. Players don&rsquo;t realize they&rsquo;re analyzing data; in fact, the games are fun. Scientists extrapolate the data to use in research. In just three months, gamers analyzed more data than Cancer Research UK could in over a year.</p><p> Then there&rsquo;s Zooniverse. Their home page says it \"provides opportunities for people around the world to contribute to real discoveries in fields ranging from astronomy to zoology. Welcome to the largest online platform for collaborative volunteer research.&rdquo;</p><p> Zooniverse is designed like a video game, allowing you to play while analyzing research. You can hunt for planets, classify orchids to help with climate research, or help scientists define surface characteristics of Mars by examining real images of the planet.</p><h3> I Don&rsquo;t Want to Work: I Want to Drum. All Day <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"picgifs-angry-birds-8610680\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/443262/picgifs-angry-birds-8610680.gif?t=1438794785460\"/></p><p> There&rsquo;s enough research proving that playing video games really does teach concrete skills you can apply at work. Could playing Angry Birds help with stress management? While we don&rsquo;t have the answer for that one, it is clear that there are some benefits to considering engaging with your team by utilizing video games as training tools.</p><p> Increasingly, employers are setting up game rooms as a strategy to drive employee engagement and allow people to unwind and play games to let off steam. If you have a work group that&rsquo;s struggling to mesh, teach them collaboration skills by setting aside game time. We mentioned World of Warcraft, but there are plenty of other games that encourage multiplayer collaboration.</p><p> Since most of us need more exercise, there&rsquo;s Wii bowling. Or you could invest in some flat screens. Every day at 2:00 p.m., to counteract that after-lunch-I-need-a-nap syndrome, you could stream Just Dance. Everybody up and out of the chairs, we&rsquo;re going to get our workplace groove on. Exercise equals endorphins. and endorphins spur creative thinking. Imagine the work impact!</p><p> Isn&rsquo;t it refreshing to think that &ldquo;Defeating villains while working in collaborative groups to overcome multifaceted challenges&rdquo; could be a description of a hot new video game &mdash; or a description of your work environment?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 17:27:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 17:27:55.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_hXv6zMZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-your-need-to-play-world-of-warcraft-at-work/\", \"post_id\": \"5217\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 17:27:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 17:27:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-your-need-to-play-world-of-warcraft-at-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5216\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2356\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/slider-image-1.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2066\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438869600,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

If your company is still responding to leads and inquiries the old fashion way and dealing with endless emails and spreadsheets of contacts, you need to continue reading this article so you can understand the impact marketing automation can have on your business.</p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%238Ways+To+Use+Marketing+Automation+to+Generate+Leads&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-use-marketing-automation-generate-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  #8Ways To Use Marketing Automation to Generate Leads </u></a><h3> Here are 8 things you can do with marketing automation software to improve your lead generation and take your sales to the next level.</h3><h3> 1. Landing Pages</h3>Landing pages let you speak to a particular audience segment and target your marketing messages with greater precision. Landing pages can also focus on the buying cycle of your audience &mdash; some for soft inquiries that provide additional research information, and others to take interested parties directly to a sale. Create custom contact forms for each of your landing pages and set up each contact form submission on a campaign specific to that landing page product or service offering. Using segmented email marketing along with a customized landing page can yield <u> <a href=\"http://blog.getvero.com/landing-pages-email-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  up to a 50 percent increase in conversions </a></u>.You might like: <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/top-8-landing-page-builders-for-marketers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Top 8 Landing Page Builders for Marketers </a></u><h3> 2. Email Drip Campaigns</h3>A &ldquo;drip campaign&rdquo; is a series of auto-responder messages sent out on a schedule to deliver timely information and move prospects through the sales funnel. Prior to setting up your drip campaign, you&rsquo;ll need to <u> <a href=\"http://www.hatchbuck.com/blog/lead-nurturing-starts-segmentation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  segment your audience </a></u> to be sure your messages are relevant. After you initiate your drip campaign, you&rsquo;ll need to track your messages to see that they&rsquo;re effective.<a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/drip.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"drip campaigns for email marketing infographic\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/drip.png\"/></a>3. A/B TestingA/B testing lets you create two versions of the same display ad, landing page, or email and test the results with a segment of your audience. For instance, every other person visiting your landing page may receive a different version of the page. This allows you to calculate the bounce rate, time spent on the site and sales to help you determine which version was more effective overall. The same goes for email marketing campaigns &mdash; test out different variations of subject lines, the content within the email, times of day, etc. Calculate <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-increase-email-open-rates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  your email open rates </a></u> and activity within the email such as link clicks and downloads.What Mod Girl Uses: <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/leadpages\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  LeadPages </a></u> for our A/B landing page testing + <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/hatchbuck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hatchbuck </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/aweber\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Aweber </a></u> for our A/B email marketing testing.<h3> 4. Building Your Contact Lists</h3>Sales start with a reliable list of prospects. The best marketing automation tools pull contacts from PPC ads, contact forms, social media contacts, and emails. Some marketing automation software will help you identify anonymous visitors and target your messages based on available demographic or behavioral data. Be sure to read Neil Patel and Ritika Puri&rsquo;s <u> helpful guide</u> on using marketing automation to &ldquo;build a lead generation engine.&rdquo;<h3> 5. Conditioning and Nurturing Leads</h3>Conditioning and nurturing leads is the most profitable function of marketing automation. You need all the other good stuff &mdash; a contact list, data entry, audience segmentation, content, landing pages and drip marketing &mdash; before you can nurture a lead. Yet, marketing automation can yield big dividends when you are able to catch and convert prospects who are most ready to buy. Marketing automation helps you:&ndash; Warm up leads with information and engagement to keep your company in mind when it&rsquo;s purchase time.&ndash; Present up-sell opportunities to engaged, interested buyers with the right message at the right time.&ndash; Catch leads that may have fallen out of the sales cycle for one reason or another and bring them back in.<img alt=\"marketing automation infographic\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/generateleads.png\"/><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Want+higher+conversions%3F+Contact+prospects+at+the+right+time+with+the+right+message.&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-use-marketing-automation-generate-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Want higher conversions? Contact prospects at the right time with the right message </u> .</a><h3> 6. Track Visitors and Email Opens</h3>There are several ways marketing automation software helps you track your contacts behaviors:&ndash; Shows you a prospect&rsquo;s activity history so you know what web pages they&rsquo;ve visited, content they&rsquo;re downloading and purchases they&rsquo;ve made.&ndash; Enables real-time alerts to let your team know when a prospect visits a targeted page (such as the price page) or performs a desired action (like downloads your eBook).&ndash; Establishes a complete record of pre-conversion engagements for all new visitors to help you determine how to connect with future newcomers to your site.&ndash; Shows you a prospect&rsquo;s email activity so you know when they open your emails, how often they open your emails, and what links they click within your emails.You might like: <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-increase-email-open-rates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  8 Ways to Increase Your Email Open Rates </a></u><h3> 7. Better Reporting</h3>Beyond tracking, there is so much more you can do with marketing automation reporting:&ndash; Get analysis on cost per lead, cost per opportunity and number of leads in the pipeline.&ndash; See where your most valuable and least valuable leads are coming from.&ndash; Find out where prospects get lost in the sales funnel and when it&rsquo;s easiest to convert.<h3> 8. Collaborate with Sales</h3>Improved coordination is another benefit of marketing automation software. Sales teams and marketers can centralize customer behavioral data pulled from social media, <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-spice-email-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  email campaigns </a></u> and web activity to ensure that all teams have access to the same information. The software allows sales teams to mark prospects for email marketing follow-up. By the same token, marketing can make note when a prospect has performed behavior signaling readiness to purchase for sales follow-up. The end result is (hopefully) an end to finger-pointing and improved alignment between departments, which can help your company grow revenue by 32 percent a year, <u> <a href=\"https://www.act-on.com/blog/7-steps-to-achieving-optimal-sales-marketing-alignment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  according to one study </a></u>.<a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/State-of-Marketing-Automation-Trends-2014.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"marketing automation trends infographic\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/State-of-Marketing-Automation-Trends-2014.png\"/></a><u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Fact%3A+%23MarketingAutomation+helps+companies+grow+revenue+by+32%25+a+year.&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-use-marketing-automation-generate-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Fact: #MarketingAutomation helps companies grow revenue by 32% a year. </a></u> ","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-05 17:15:06.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-05 17:15:06.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_On929kJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-ways-to-use-marketing-automation-to-generate-leads/\", \"post_id\": \"5215\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-05 17:15:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-05 17:15:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-ways-to-use-marketing-automation-to-generate-leads\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5214\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2355\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarketingAutomation-1024x680.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"873\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438888500,"author_id":316,"chart_url":""}

Not to mention the SEO impact, direct access to industry thought leaders &amp; opinion formers, enhanced staff engagement, cost-effective recruitment, unrivalled market intelligence and a regular source of new business leads.

{"original_id":2304,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Keys to Better Communication in Relationships","link":"3-keys-to-better-communication-in-relationships","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wrightliving\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dr. Bob Wright  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://wrightliving.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Wright Living  </u> </a>  </p><p> Everyone knows that committed relationships take hard work, open communication and self-reflection. But sometimes someone says or does something the other person doesn&rsquo;t like. Sometimes we end up thinking, &ldquo;I wish I wouldn&rsquo;t have said that.&rdquo; We try our best to be loving and supportive partners, but during heated moments it&rsquo;s easy to lose sight of the big picture or to let something slip we didn&rsquo;t really mean.</p><p> Within any relationship, there are always opportunities to improve your communication with your partner. Here&rsquo;s how&hellip;</p><h3> 1. Remember Where Your Emotions Come From</h3><p> <br/> When you&rsquo;re in a conflict, you can use the fight as an opportunity to  <strong>  grow, learn and develop. </strong> 80% of hurt in fights is historic: something happening now reminds you of the past and brings up those old feelings. For example, an interaction with your partner could stir up feelings of embarrassment due to a similarly embarrassing experience from your childhood. This emotional charge could prevent you from equipping yourself for the conflict and cloud your judgment. Be assertive with your feelings and make them known. If you need to, take a break from the conflict to get your bearings straight.</p><h3> 2. Stop Managing and Communicate What You Yearn For</h3><p> <br/> During any sort of conflict, it&rsquo;s important to keep the focus on your feelings and the feelings of your partner. The goal is not to change them. Instead, it&rsquo;s about  <strong>  finding common ground. </strong> It&rsquo;s easy to get into the bad habit of trying to micromanage your partner and the way he or she does things. You may be doing it subtly or even subconsciously. The other person may be feeling managed due to the words or body language choices you&rsquo;re making. Stop and take the time to understand their reactions. Then you can both communicate what you&rsquo;re yearning for and reveal the true roots of the conflict.</p><h3> 3. Don&rsquo;t Forget the Rules of Engagement</h3><p> <br/> There are actually 7 ground rules for conflict, which we will reveal in our upcoming book,   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Heart-Fight-Couples-Fifteen/dp/1626252572\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Heart of the Fight  </a> </u>  from New Harbinger Publications, coming February 2016. Available for preorder now!</p><h3> For now, let&rsquo;s break down 3 of the big ones here: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Each person is responsible for 100% of their own happiness. </strong> It&rsquo;s not up to your partner to make you feel satisfied. It&rsquo;s completely up to you. Reflect on the things you yearn for in life: what really makes you feel engaged in this world? When you understand how to make yourself happy, you&rsquo;ll no longer need to rely on others. Yes, your partner may make you feel emotionally, sexually or socially satisfied&mdash;but only YOU are behind the definition of what that really means.</li><li> <strong>  Nobody gets more than 50% of the blame in a fight. </strong> It may be tough at times, but regardless of what the fight is about, no one gets more than half of the blame. Period. There may be times when you could easily admit your part in a scenario. For example, you know that you did in fact leave the car windows rolled down when it was raining. However, when conflicts are deeper or when you feel you own  <strong>  none </strong>  of the blame, it&rsquo;s time to get completely honest with yourself about the situation. Ask yourself what your role in the conflict was, even if it seems minute at the time. If the roles were reversed, what could you have done to prevent the situation from happening? Own up to your part in the fight, whether it&rsquo;s obvious or not.</li><li> <strong>  Agree with the truth, always. </strong> This can be quite difficult, because it means admitting someone else may be right. Sometimes the truth hurts, but you have to face the facts when your significant other makes a statement you know isn&rsquo;t false. Instead of getting defensive, once again look within and  <strong>  own the truth. </strong> It&rsquo;s been said that it shall set you free, after all&mdash;so make every effort possible to keep the facts straight and the drama down low. <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s not always easy to be in a relationship and it can be really easy to feel as though you&rsquo;re not communicating with your partner. Communication is about honesty, both within yourself and with your partner. Keep your personal emotions in check during times of heated conflict or things could be become much worse. Remember the rules of engaging in conflict. Focusing on these 3 keys to better communication will ensure you and your partner will be able to learn and grow from each new situation.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-04 21:29:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-04 21:29:35.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_7EPYK54.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-keys-to-better-communication-in-relationships/\", \"post_id\": \"5211\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-04 21:29:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-04 21:29:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-keys-to-better-communication-in-relationships\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5210\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2353\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/34316967@N04-0-conversation.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"574\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438797600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Did European central banks sell gold down to dampen the psychological impact of the event? Understating the seriousness of the debt crisis may have prevented investors from seeking gold as protection.</p><p> Conspiracy theories or not, I believe none of this tarnishes gold&rsquo;s sustainable allure. It&rsquo;s important to look at the two key demand drivers for gold: the Fear Trade and the Love Trade. The Fear Trade is related to money supply and negative real interest rates. The Love Trade comes from the purchase of gold due to cultural affinity and the rising GDP per capita in Asia and the Middle East.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve always advocated, and continue to advocate, a 10 percent weighting: 5 percent in gold stocks and 5 percent in bullion, then rebalance every year.</p><h3> From Crisis to Opportunity</h3><p> <br/> Take a look at the chart, which shows that the bearish trend is obvious.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-Contrarian-Tool-Gold-Net-Position-for-Leveraged-Futures-07312015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" Gold Net-Position for Leveraged Futures\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-Contrarian-Tool-Gold-Net-Position-for-Leveraged-Futures-07312015.png\"/> </a> <br/> And yet many investors are still buying. In an interview this week with Money Metals Exchange and in talking to Bart Kitner, founder of Kitco, both conversations confirmed that smart investors are enthusiastically buying gold during this downdraft in prices.</p><h3> Rational Investors Know a Deal When They See One, and Feel One</h3><p> <br/> With so much gloom and doom in the media surrounding gold right now, you might wonder why coin sales are soaring at multiyear highs. The reason is pretty simple: Gold is on sale.</p><img alt=\"Ray Dalio manages the largest hedge fund in the world\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-Ray-Dalio.jpg\"/><p> High net worth individuals and other savvy investors realize that even now, as herds of people are rushing for the exit, owning gold is one of the best ways to manage systemic risk. They follow that Greeks had their cash in banks frozen like in Cyprus only a few years ago.</p><p> Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, said it best: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t own gold, you know neither history nor economics.&rdquo;</p><p> Indeed, some investors fail to take a long-term perspective on gold. Their sentiment toward the metal extends only as far back as the most recent selloff, induced by the strong U.S. dollar,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/3-reasons-why-gold-isnt-behaving-like-gold-right-now/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   weak global manufacturing activity  </a> </u>  and fears that interest rates will soon rise.</p><p> Many investors have that &ldquo;sinking feeling&rdquo; with a deterioration in global PMI, leading economic indicators, falling commodity prices and the threat of rising U.S. interest rates. Many have raised their cash levels due to decelerating global growth prospects. I&rsquo;ve written that bad news is good news because when governments accelerate monetary policy, this can be a good opportunity for investors to add to their gold exposure.</p><img alt=\"Countries with largest gold holdings\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/Countries-with-largest-gold-holdings-06-2015.gif\"/><p> I&rsquo;m not the only one who takes this position. Besides the investors gobbling up American Gold Eagles, central banks around the world continue to buy, hold and repatriate bullion. The U.S. Federal Reserve maintains its 8,133 tonnes, the most of any central bank. Germany, the Netherlands and other countries have brought home mounds of the yellow metal in the last 12 months. China has increased its reserves 60 percent in the last six years. And Texas is in the early stages of establishing its own gold depository, the first state to do so. If there were no faith left in the metal, why would banks even bother with it?</p><p> At the same time, massive amounts of paper money are still being printed. In fact, the International Monetary Fund has asked the Bank of Japan to be ready to increase its monetary stimulus further,  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-23/japan-s-debt-risks-surge-to-triple-gdp-without-change-imf-says\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   according to Bloomberg  </u>  . </a>  Let the paper printing roll! In the U.S., where quantitative easing was supposed to have ended back in October, the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet is still within 0.3 percent of its all-time high, according to Sovereign Man.</p><h3> Based on Historical Volatility Models Gold Is Extremely Oversold</h3><p> <br/> Before the bottom fell out, gold&rsquo;s support seemed to have been around $1,150, whereas the resistance trend line was breaking down. The descending triangle pattern, seen below, indicates that demand was weakening and downside momentum was gathering force. </p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-Gold-Price-Falls-Through-Key-Support-Level-07312015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Gold Price Falls Through Key Support Level\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-Gold-Price-Falls-Through-Key-Support-Level-07312015.png\"/> </a> <br/> A useful tool that traders and analysts use is Bloomberg&rsquo;s relative strength indicator (RSI). Below is gold&rsquo;s RSI over the same one-year period. It shows that gold has passed below the 30 mark into oversold territory. When this happens, many analysts see it as a buying opportunity. Between November 3&mdash;the last time gold fell this significantly below 30&mdash;and January 20, the yellow metal ended up rallying 13 percent.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-Gold-at-its-most-oversold-since-november-2014-07312015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Gold at Its Most Oversold Since November 2014\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-Gold-at-its-most-oversold-since-november-2014-07312015.png\"/> </a> <br/> <br/> A similar tool we use to identify buy and sell signals is the price oscillator, which I often explain while speaking at conferences. This tool measures how many standard deviations an asset&rsquo;s value has moved from its mean (and in which direction). When the number crosses above two standard deviations, it&rsquo;s often interpreted as an opportunity to take some profits, and when it crosses below negative two, it might be a good time to think about accumulating.</p><h3> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-Gold-20-Day-Percent-Change-Oscillator-07312015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Gold 20-Day Percent Change Oscillator\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-Gold-20-Day-Percent-Change-Oscillator-07312015.png\"/> </a> <br/> Love Trade and Fear Trade: Gold&rsquo;s Tailwinds and Headwinds</h3><p> <br/> I always look at two demand factors for gold, the Fear Trade and the Love Trade. The Love Trade is the purchase of gold for weddings, anniversaries and cultural celebrations while the Fear Trade is gold&rsquo;s reaction to monetary and fiscal policies, particularly real interest rates.</p><p> <img alt=\"10,000 Chinese consumers wait in line to buy gold.\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-31/COMM-10000-chinese-consumers-wait-in-line-to-buy-gold-07312015.jpg\"/> <br/> Historically, the Love Trade has been on the upswing starting around this time&mdash;late July and early August&mdash;in anticipation of international festivals and holidays such as Diwali, Christmas and the Chinese New Year. But as you can see in the oscillator chart above, gold is down 1.4 standard deviations for the 10-year period. This suggests gold may be at an attractive level to accumulate, and gold stocks can offer greater beta when gold begins to revert to its mean.</p><p> The Fear Trade, on the other hand, involves the Fear Trade and real interest rates (inflation &ndash; CPI = real interest rates). Several times in the past I&rsquo;ve explained how gold tends to benefit when real interest rates turn negative. When the rate of inflation exceeds the yield on a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/3-reasons-why-gold-isnt-behaving-like-gold-right-now\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   five-year Treasury note  </a> </u> , it makes gold much more attractive to many investors.</p><p> At this time, the five-year Treasury yield sits at 1.58 percent while inflation is crawling along at 0.1 percent. This means that real rates are a positive 1.48 percent&mdash;a headwind for gold. As I told Daniela Cambone during last week&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/in-the-news/is-gold-due-for-a-rally-07-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Gold Game Film  </u>  , </a>  the U.S. has some of the highest real rates of return in the world right now.</p><p> To see gold gain traction again, not only do we need to see negative real interest rates in the U.S. we need to see rising real GDP per capita in China and rising PMI in China.</p><p> On a final note, there appears to be a battle between the debt markets and equity markets. The debt market yields suggest rates will not be rising next month or quarter, while equity markets suggest they will. I think the bond market is more accurate. With a struggling global economy and commodity deflation odds favor rates will not rise soon in America, and gold will revert back to the mean.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-04 21:23:43.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-04 21:23:43.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_zbmz0S5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/gold-on-sale-says-the-rational-investor/\", \"post_id\": \"5209\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-04 21:23:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-04 21:23:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"gold-on-sale-says-the-rational-investor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5208\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2352\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/COMM-gold-doesnt-tarnish-easily-07312015.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"760\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438779600,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

The fact is, no matter what you&rsquo;re playing&mdash;Majong, Bridge, or the &ldquo;game of life&rdquo;&mdash;whether you realize it or not, you&rsquo;re always making choices. Even if you &ldquo;choose not to choose.&rdquo;</p><p> In my work, I see examples of people failing to make choices every day. As an outsider looking in, I get a unique perspective, and I can see that most of these non-decisions are rooted in the roles people have taken on for themselves&mdash;in a family, as part of a couple, or as part of society as a whole. Years ago I read Harriet Lerner&rsquo;s excellent book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dance-Anger-Changing-Patterns-Relationships/dp/0062319043/ref=la_B000AQ02TS_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437679533&amp;sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dance of Anger: A Woman's Guide to Changing the Patterns of Intimate Relationships  </a> </u>  that examines roles and patterns not just in romantic relationships, but in families and society as well. That understanding helped me realize why I made some of my own choices&mdash;even when I didn&rsquo;t realize I had a choice at all.</p><p> When my husband Ed was disabled from his stroke, I became his caregiver. To me, there was never a question of whether or not I would do this. It was a given. It was part of my value system. It was written into my DNA. Years later, I remember someone asking me why I made the choice to take that role&mdash;to care for him at the expense of my own social life and, some might say, my life as a whole. It was difficult for me to even digest the question. What &ldquo;choice&rdquo;? At the time, I didn&rsquo;t feel there was a choice to be made. I just did what I had to do. And yet, in retrospect, I now realize it was a choice&mdash;and an important one at that.</p><p> Would I have made a different decision if I&rsquo;d realized I had an actual choice at the time? I don&rsquo;t believe so. And yet there are so many other decisions we make every day that may go in a different direction if we&rsquo;re able to step back to consider our options, analyze the potential outcomes, and make the best possible choice for us at the time. This is particularly important when it comes to money.</p><p> Last week, I met with my clients Barbara and Rob. They&rsquo;re in their early 50s with three kids&mdash;one in college and two in high school. Rob just got laid off, and while they have a solid savings in place, they&rsquo;re concerned about making it last as long as possible to cover Rob&rsquo;s job search.</p><p> As we talked through their concerns, college costs were an obvious piece of the puzzle. But when we started talking about the possibility of telling their kids they could only cover a portion of the expense with money in their 529 Plans, Barbara was adamant: &ldquo;Absolutely not an option! We&rsquo;ve always told them we&rsquo;d pay for college. We can&rsquo;t back out now.&rdquo;</p><p> She was clearly upset, and I can&rsquo;t blame her. As mothers, it&rsquo;s our instinct to protect our children&mdash;to help them be happy at all costs&mdash;even to our own detriment. We mothers can&rsquo;t seem to help ourselves:</p><li> My client MaryAnn told me her mortgage would have been paid off by now, but she &ldquo;had to&rdquo; help out her 40-year-old son and his family financially. At 66, she&rsquo;d like to retire, but she still owes nearly $300K on her mortgage. <br/>  </li><li> Frances, a recent widow, has a drug-addicted daughter who wants to come live with mom to &ldquo;help&rdquo; her out now that dad is gone. Letting her daughter move in to her home would challenge her emotionally and financially, but even with the support and guidance she&rsquo;s found at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.al-anon.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Al-Anon  </a> </u> , she can&rsquo;t get herself to say no. <br/>  </li><li> At 70, Rachel wants to know if she should buy life insurance to be sure her 50-year-old daughter is taken care of after she dies. <br/>  </li><p> The list goes on&hellip;and on. Children and money and mothers. Someone once said, &ldquo;Mothers are only as happy as our least happy child.&rdquo; (How true!) But I see it present big money problems, all because of our maternal &ldquo;money rules.&rdquo;</p><p> As  <strong>  women </strong> , it&rsquo;s particularly important that we identify these rules we&rsquo;ve created for ourselves and make changes to find balance in our financial lives&mdash;and to make active financial choices based on our current reality. But change is hard, especially when it comes to money. It&rsquo;s so much easier to pretend your husband really can balance the checkbook. Or that you can&rsquo;t understand money or investing. Or that your adult child really can&rsquo;t cope without your help. Or even that you&rsquo;ll win the lottery tomorrow. That&rsquo;s why, for so many, change never happens.</p><p> My challenge to you is to start making changes today, no matter how scary it feels. A great first step is to find someone to talk to about your financial decisions&mdash;a confidante with an objective point of view who can take two steps back and help you see the choices you&rsquo;re making. And if talking about money feels like a scary change in itself, remember that, for most of us, money is a very private issue. But that third-party perspective is often vital to helping us change our old patterns for the better.</p><p> Sue Alpert&rsquo;s book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Driving-Solo-Business-Financial-Survival/dp/1629670197/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437681606&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=driving+solo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Driving Solo: Dealing With Grief and the Business of Financial Survival  </a> </u>  is about her challenges in changing her own &ldquo;money rules&rdquo; when she was widowed.

As of 2015, Millennials surpassed Generation X to become the largest share of the American workforce.</p><p> Additionally, as many businesses are discovering, more baby boomers are leaving the workforce. Thus, not only are we experiencing a smaller, younger pool of talent, but an overall reshaping of the business landscape.</p><p> Studies reveal that 80 percent of today&rsquo;s workforce does not want to manage, make decisions, be responsible for others or for results, be accountable, sign-off on budgets, write performance reviews, reprimand direct reports, or even own a business. Sure, today&rsquo;s younger workers want you to give them opportunities, train and develop them, but very few appear willing to put &ldquo;skin&rdquo; in the game&mdash;at least that&rsquo;s my observation (and what I hear routinely from clients).</p><p> Today&rsquo;s workers want to be seen as special and unique. They want to be treated as &ldquo;heroes.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ve been raised, and they believe it&rsquo;s your responsibility to continue providing the level of &ldquo;love and affection&rdquo; they desire and know.</p><p> Heroes in the workplace are great on an occasion, but they can create more problems than success. Heroes thrive on public acknowledgement, and they often need to be reminded they are part of a team. Some heroes might even create the chaotic situations they solve. You know who these people are. Being the hero makes them feel good about themselves and adds to their sense of worth.</p><p> Heroes should not be the focus of all of your affection at the expense of reliable, everyday players. Heroes &mdash; and the attention they demand &mdash; often foster resentment between co-workers and can even lead to workplace sabotage. No one wants that.</p><p> Luckily, when people come to work every day, execute their responsibilities, stand accountable, meet their objectives and goals, and act as good team players, everyone works at a higher level and the need for heroes decreases. For business leaders, the message is plain and simple: your focus and energy needs to be directed at optimizing these everyday players.</p><p> But what&rsquo;s a business leader to do when the workplace is about to be dominated by individuals who always have been told they are special, the brightest and the best? (Keep in mind, these are the same people who received awards, trophies, and accolades just for showing up. They are used to every little league baseball player receiving a trophy, not only members of the first-place team, and teachers who refused to use red marks on homework because of the &ldquo;negative&rdquo; impact it could have on children.) Leaders need to ensure those working for them are doing their jobs as required each and every day, and doing it optimally, rather than kowtowing to heroes who show up with greatness only periodically when their need for attention and adulation arises.</p><p> Here are three subtle shifts in approach business leaders can adopt right away to focus organizational energy on maximizing the workforce:</p><li> <strong>  Consider who you are and lead by example. </strong>  How you behave sets the tone for the organization. If you are a yeller, you give employees the right to yell. If you leave early, you give them permission to leave early. If you work hard&hellip;  (you get the picture) .</li><li> <strong>  Let the people you hired do their work. </strong>  Your direct reports want to be fulfilled. If you are constantly doing the work for them, they will work below expectations, become dissatisfied and leave. What&rsquo;s preferable: the distractions of recruiting and rebuilding or increased productivity and profitability?</li><li> <strong>  Learn to trust employees so you don&rsquo;t create a culture of skepticism.  </strong> When you trust employees, they feel free to try new and creative approaches to solving problems, rather than always looking over their shoulders.

{"original_id":2300,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Meerkat vs. Periscope: Live Video Streaming on Twitter","link":"meerkat-vs-periscope-live-video-streaming-on-twitter","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/razorsocial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Razor Social  </u> </a> Live streaming of video may not be new, but it has experienced a recent rise in popularity.If you are not already familiar with live video streaming, now is the time to join in the action.In just a matter of weeks, there has been a massive increase in interest and use of live streaming, most of which can be put down to the introduction of two new apps:  <u>  <a href=\"http://meerkatapp.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meerkat  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Periscope  </a> </u> .For quite a while now, there have been apps like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   UStream  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"https://livestream.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Livestream  </a> </u> , which have allowed users to stream video to their audience.However Meerkat and Periscope have surprised us all by changing the way we use live-video streaming.Why?</p><li> <strong>  They are mobile based: </strong>  Previous apps required streaming from a laptop but now live streaming can take place anywhere at any time.  All that is needed is a good Internet connection.</li><li> <strong>  They work with a click of a button: </strong>  Other apps require some configuration and, at times, this can be frustrating. These new apps allow users to start a new broadcast with just one click.</li><li> <strong>  Social connectivity: </strong>  Both these apps integrate with Twitter, which incorporates the social element, allowing users to reach a much wider audience than ever before.</li>Neither of these apps has reached perfection yet and both are working very quickly to improve their features.The fact, however, is that <strong> both of these apps offer a whole new world of possibilities for audience interaction</strong>, which is paramount for social media success.Interested to know which one works best?Let&rsquo;s survey their individual landscapes and see which one is doing the best job.<h3> Meerkat &ndash; Easy user experience</h3>Named after those adorably cheeky little creatures known for their ability to keep constant watch over their manors, Meerkat was the first app to offer live-streaming video for Twitter.It was so popular, in fact, that Twitter tried their hardest to buy the business.Their negotiations failed and it remains an independent start-up company.One of the best things about Meerkat is just how user-friendly it is for both users and broadcasters.The app has a clean and simple interface<strong>  showing one main screen with only a few options</strong>. All available streams are listed in a visually appealing manner with an eye-catching image.Broadcasts are listed visually within an easy to use interface.Another simple-to-use feature is the <strong> option to schedule a broadcast in the following 24 hours.</strong>When you do this, the event will show up in the app feed, and the app will even send a tweet out.<strong> Users can also subscribe to an incoming stream</strong> and, when the time is up, the app will send a notification to the users&rsquo; mobile devices.Scheduling allows selecting a time as well as featured image.<strong> Meerkat has also incorporated some gamification into the app</strong> by creating a leaderboard of broadcasters, which adds another interesting component to keep users engaged whilst incentivizing broadcasters to create more content.The exact ranking information behind the leaderboard are not public, however, it&rsquo;s been suggested they take three factors into consideration:<li> Total number of people watching your stream.</li><li> Total number of minutes of streamed video.</li><li> Total number of comments.</li>The leaderboard is a good incentive to keep broadcasting.Nothing is perfect and Meerkat does have a few shortcomings:<li> It is difficult to find and follow the users you currently follow on Twitter.</li><li> The act of finding users is a bit of a challenge. Even when you search by username, you are not shown a thumbnail to confirm the user&rsquo;s identity.</li>Meerkat does distinct features for users and broadcasters:<h3> Main Features for Viewers</h3><li> <strong>  Comments: </strong> Users can interact with the broadcaster by posting comments that can also be pushed to Twitter as tweets. Viewers can browse previous comments to follow conversations.</li><li> <strong>  Retweet option: </strong>  This allows retweeting of the broadcast title and link. However, there is no option to retweet comments from other users.</li><li> <strong>  Like option: </strong> Represented with a heart, this feature &ldquo;likes&rdquo; the tweet used to announce the broadcast.</li><li> <strong>  Browse through all viewers: </strong> Viewers&rsquo; thumbnails are displayed on top of the broadcast. Clicking on their thumbnail allows you to see their Twitter handle and bio, however, you cannot follow or interact directly with them on the app.</li>You can see easily who is connected to the same broadcast.<li> <strong>  Follow broadcaster on Twitter: </strong> Using this feature you can follow a broadcaster on Twitter, through the app, by clicking on their name during a live broadcast.</li><li> <strong>  Report stream: </strong>  if you find something offensive or think it goes against the app&rsquo;s terms of service, you can report the stream.</li><h3> Main Features for Broadcasters</h3><li> <strong>  Custom stream announcement: </strong>  The app allows you to create a personalized tweet to announce your broadcast, which can include hashtags or specific keywords to generate more attention and traffic.</li>Including hashtags in your broadcast title are a great way to get more viewers.<li> <strong>  Commenting feature: </strong>  Broadcasters have the option to browse through old comments and reply to them.</li><li> <strong>  Saving the stream to the camera roll: </strong>  Meerkat does not allow you to watch finished broadcasts.  However, the recording can be saved on your smartphone to be used as a normal video file that you can edit and share on other platforms.</li><li> <strong>  Call-to-Action button:  </strong> At the end of each stream, you can show viewers a call-to-action button that can be customized with the text and destination URL of your choice. This is ideal to maintain engagement after the broadcast has finished.</li>Use a cutom call-to-action to drive traffic once the broadcast finishes.<li> <strong>  Stream scheduling: </strong>  Scheduling a future stream allows you to choose an engaging photo to promote your event. When users subscribe to a scheduled stream, they get notified when it is about to commence.</li>Seeing the avatars of all participants at the top of the screen can allow broadcasters to greet and engage with followers. Retweets and likes are also displayed as comments, so broadcasters can engage further by thanking people who take those actions.<h3> SUMMARY</h3>Meerkat is probably a good option to get started with mobile video streaming, even though it still needs some work on the Twitter connectivity.It is very focused on two-way communication between broadcasters and viewers, which is key to creating audience engagement.<h3> Pros</h3><li> Gamification.</li><li> Scheduling Streams.</li><li> Ease of use.</li><li> Call-to-action button displayed after the stream.</li><li> Option to save video.</li><h3> Cons</h3><li> Not easy to follow users on Twitter.</li><li> Stream not available to be watched at a later date.</li><h3> Periscope &ndash; Expanded connectivity</h3>As Periscope is owned by Twitter, the app offers a much better connectivity with Twitter than Meerkat does.<strong> Periscope allows you to find all your Twitter connections very easily and add them to your Periscope account.</strong>This connectivity is also present during live streams, where <strong> you can browse other users watching the same video and add them to your Periscope following list.</strong>That feature does not stop there; you can also see their networks and follow those users too! This is a great way of quickly increasing your network by finding people with similar interests.Following your connection&rsquo;s followers is really easy.Similarly to Meerkat, on Periscope, people can only connect with each other within the app.Following someone on Periscope won&rsquo;t follow the same person on Twitter.In other words, you can find your Twitter connections on Periscope and follow them,<strong> but your Periscope connections won&rsquo;t be replicated on Twitter.</strong>One great feature of Periscope is <strong> full-screen video</strong>, which only includes a few buttons and eliminates distractions from the stream.However, <strong> comments from viewers include a thumbnail of the user, which can be distracting </strong>(there is the option to deactivate comments though).Full-screen video is a great feature, but comments could be distractingUnlike Meerkat, Periscope does not have an option to favorite a video.  However,<strong> you can share the broadcast with your network.</strong>Periscope could be enhanced greatly with improvements to the commenting feature.During a live stream, comments disappear after a few seconds &ndash; which may seem like a good idea to maintain a clean video layout &ndash; however, <strong> old comments cannot be retrieved,</strong>which could be an issue for broadcasters trying to respond to questions and engage in conversations.Also, <strong> comments are not pushed to Twitter as tweets</strong>, limiting the exposure of the broadcast.Another downfall is that broadcasters cannot comment in their own stream; which could be an issue in situations where verbal communication is not an option, such as noisy environments.Now for the main features of Periscope:<h3> Main Features for Users</h3><li> <strong>  Access to past streams: </strong> Videos are uploaded into the Periscope server and can be watched at a later date, allowing users to watch content that was streamed at times when they were not available.</li>Late for a broadcast? No worries, you can watch a replay.<li> <strong>  Easy to follow users: </strong> See a comment that you like? Want to find the same user in other streams? Connecting with new people is easy with Periscope.</li><li> <strong>  Sharing stream: </strong>  Periscope lets you share a stream with all your followers or specific ones, which is a great way to share interesting content with others.</li><li> <strong>  Report stream: </strong> As with Meerkat, you can report a stream if necessary.</li><h3> Main Features for Broadcasters</h3><li> <strong>  Video uploading: </strong>  Periscope does not allow scheduling streams, so followers who are not connected at the commencement of your broadcast might miss it. However uploading the video after the broadcast solves this problem, allowing those users to watch it when convenient.</li><li> <strong>  Private broadcast:  </strong> The app allows for the streaming of content with specific users, which is a great feature to deliver private content for paid services or membership only.</li>Tap on users to add them to a private broadcast.<li> <strong>  Option to limit chat to certain users:  </strong> If you are concerned trolls will access your stream, fear no more. Periscope allows you to receive comments only from users who are connected to you in the app.</li><li> <strong>  Saving to camera roll:  </strong> As with Meerkat, you can save a stream for editing and sharing across other platforms.</li><li> <strong>  Post-stream statistics:  </strong> After the stream finishes, Periscope displays basic but useful statistics that can help you measure engagement levels.</li>Statistics are basic, but enough to help you understanding the level of engagement<h3> SUMMARY</h3>Periscope has huge potential due to support from Twitter. Even though the interface is more complex to understand at the beginning, this is compensated by high-quality video and the connectivity with other users.<h3> Pros</h3><li> Private broadcasts.</li><li> Finding Twitter connections is easy.</li><li> Videos can be watched after the stream has finished.</li><li> Large video screen.</li><li> Post stream statistics.</li><h3> Cons</h3><li> Does not allow scheduling.</li><li> Does not include an option to drive traffic (eg. Call-to-action button).</li><li> Limited commenting capabilities.</li><h3> CONCLUSION</h3><u> Live-streaming video</u> has great potential to get messages out there by showing the action in real time.Regardless of which app better suits your needs, the key to successful live streaming &ndash; on any social media platform &ndash; is developing a network of engaged users.To do this, you need to have a clear idea of what you want to tell the world, when you want to do it and WHERE you want to tell it.Do you have any experience with live-stream videos?Have you considered using them for your business?What are your main concerns and ideas?","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-04 20:53:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-04 20:53:27.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_3LKGPSu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/meerkat-vs-periscope-live-video-streaming-on-twitter/\", \"post_id\": \"5203\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-04 20:53:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-04 20:53:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"meerkat-vs-periscope-live-video-streaming-on-twitter\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5202\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2349\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Meerkat-VS-Periscope_7-business-uses.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1067\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438802100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2299,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Things You Should Be Doing on Twitter Right Now","link":"6-things-you-should-be-doing-on-twitter-right-now","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The Internet was once coined as the &ldquo;information highway&rdquo;. Now it seems like Twitter can take that claim. </p><h3> 1. Be A Thought Leader</h3><p> <br/> Positioning your brand as a thought leader should be a priority. There&rsquo;s no other social network outside of LinkedIn that will help establish authority. For instance, Twitter is highly regarded as a network that provides real-time news during a widely publicized event (although Facebook is trying to take over the reigns with its &ldquo;what&rsquo;s trending column&rdquo;).</p><p> The first step in being a thought leader on Twitter is to establish your handle as a  <u>  destination for content </u>  that your target audience wants to consume on a regular basis. Tweet links to current news in your industry. Tweet thought provoking content and accompanied with a stimulating question.</p><h3> 2. Engage with Your Audience</h3><p> <br/> The best way to utilize Twitter is to have a conversation with your audience. DO NOT use it to simply tweet articles, sales discounts, and deadlines. Now, your audience will mention your brand in a tweet and expect a response. It&rsquo;s a standard practice on the platform. In fact, you will notice brands that have a dedicated staff to handle the Twitter customer service questions.</p><p> Now let&rsquo;s take this a step further.</p><p> If you do not engage with your audience via Twitter it will negatively affect your brand. Brands that avoid audience engagement will ultimately lose customers.</p><br /><p> Companies that engage and respond to customer service requests on social media can cause an increase in sales because customers will spend up to 40% more with that company when satisfied. &ndash; Bain &amp; Company</p><h3> 3. Have Some Personality</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s difficult to express your personality in less than 140 characters. I mean, how can you be humorous and informative in a tweet and include a link and  <u>  relevant hashtag </u> ?</p><p> Well, that&rsquo;s a great question. The only answer I can give is to find the personality in your brand and give it a voice. Here&rsquo;s a good example:</p><br /><h3> 4. Drive Traffic to Your Content</h3><p> <br/> Twitter is a very effective platform to drive traffic to your content. I find most people do not post the same tweet more than two or three times. Unfortunately, they may think all their followers will be on Twitter at the same time. Just because you post something on your timeline doesn&rsquo;t mean your followers will see it. By the time the login to Twitter, your tweet could be long gone. There&rsquo;s a good chance you came across this article on Twitter</p><p> Also, you naturally can drive more traffic to your content by including relevant hashtags with your tweets.</p><br /><p> No need to be excessive, just two hashtags will work fine.</p><h3> 5. Keep Tabs On Your Competition</h3><p> <br/> A great way to keep tabs on your competition is to  <u>  monitor their Twitter feed </u> . You&rsquo;ll see links to their latest posts, white papers, acquisitions and product announcements.</p><br /><p> You can also see what their customers are saying about your competition by searching their brand name and any hashtags they use.</p><h3> 6. Mention Your Followers</h3><p> <br/> Courtesy offline is valued just as much online. Mentioning your followers will provide deeper engagement and show that you care. Give a shout-out to a follower that gives you some love. Here&rsquo;s a great example  <img alt=\":)\" src=\"http://juntaedelane.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\"/></p><br /><h3> Final Thought</h3><p> <br/> Twitter has reached the point of maturity and users are now accustomed to certain behaviors. So, if you are not doing any of the above, you should rethink your Twitter strategy. If you are, think of ways you can improve.</p><p> Ultimately, Twitter is a great tool to communicate with and analyze the conversation of your consumers. If you aren&rsquo;t maximizing the full potential of this platform, you&rsquo;re missing out on an additional opportunity to grow your business.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-04 20:40:06.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-04 20:40:06.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_44t7JFk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-things-you-should-be-doing-on-twitter-right-now/\", \"post_id\": \"5201\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-04 20:40:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-04 20:40:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-things-you-should-be-doing-on-twitter-right-now\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5200\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2348\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/twitter-birds.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"354\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438786800,"author_id":258,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2298,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What is the Client Experience End Game?","link":"what-is-the-client-experience-end-game","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I won't take the sports analogy very far, but what is the CX end game? Why should companies be focusing on customer experience? <br/> <br/> That seems like a crazy question to ask in 2015, yet there are still so many CX professionals who are struggling to convince their executives of the importance of committing resources to improving the customer experience. It's sad, really. After all, we are all customers. Do we like being treated the way we're treated when we interact with the companies we buy from? That thought alone should be a motivator! <br/> <br/> I've  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/09/help-my-execs-dont-get-it.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   written in the past  </a> </u>  about different ways (e.g., stakeholder interviews, quick wins, business case, journey mapping, customer immersion programs, etc.) to get executive commitment, ways that ensure that we appeal to both the emotional and the rational sides of their brains, i.e., we know they focus on the bottom line, but we also know that they are human and have empathy buried deep within. Somewhere. <br/> <br/> Today, I'd like to focus on the rational (numbers) side and suggest that ROI doesn't always come immediately in the form of higher revenue or higher profits. O, ultimately, that will be the case, but sometimes the benefits of focusing on the customer and his experience and reaping the subsequent financial returns are a bit more indirect but just as impactful.  <br/> <br/> How so? Well, I'll start with answering the question: \"Why should companies be focusing on the customer experience?\" My response is...  to design an experience that creates raving fans: those who will come back again and again and recommend your products to friends and family. <br/> <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/06/what-is-purpose-of-business.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   purpose of a business  </a> </u>  is to nurture and to create customers. But I believe they ought to go one step further and create raving fans. Why? There are a lot of reasons.  <br/> <br/> Raving fans...</p><li> want to see the brand succeed and grow</li><li> are happy to provide feedback, good or bad, to ensure that happens</li><li> are less price sensitive and can withstand price increases</li><li> choose your brand over the competition</li><li> can't live without the brand, accept no substitutes</li><li> are advocates; no, stronger: they are evangelists, happy to spread the word about your brand</li><li> wear your brand, and want to show that they are part of something bigger than themselves. Tattoos, anyone? Have a number (12)?</li><li> openly recruit new members to the community</li><li> care about each other, want to help each other</li><li> feel like they belong to something bigger than themselves (think \"tribe\")</li><li> require less support because they are more familiar with your products </li><li> are more likely to be using several of your products/services, not just one</li><li> wait in line - long lines, early morning lines - to buy your products</li><li> elevate your brand, earning favorable placement in stores and more <br/>  </li><p> So the next time you're asked about proving the ROI of focusing on the customer or the customer experience, mention some of these things.  <br/> The point? Sometimes ROI isn't an immediate financial benefit or a number on a financial document; sometimes ROI is a little softer than that. Don't get me wrong. As you can see, there are tangible benefits. <br/> <br/> Raving fans save you time and money. They don't weigh down your resources, i.e., they can help themselves - and others, for that matter.  And they sell for you, helping you save on marketing and advertising dollars. <br/> <br/> Raving fans are pretty powerful. They give you an advantage over your competition. These customers are patient and buy from you regardless of the wait, the pains, the pressures, whatever. They want your products! <br/> <br/> Need some examples of brands with raving fans? Think: Apple, Harley-Davidson, Seattle Seahawks. <br/> <br/> How do you create raving fans? Design an experience that's personal, remarkable, memorable, emotional, and consistent. It starts with getting the basics right. What are the basics? Listen. Ask your customers. They'll be happy to tell you. <br/> <br/> Providing a great customer experience means that customers come to expect great things from you; and that's a good thing! It means you don't have to spend months and dollars figuring out how to position, place, or promote your product. You can focus more on the product and on the experience instead. Consistently providing a great experience for your customers/fans yields a win-win for everyone in the long run.  <br/> <br/> What's the end game? Delivering a great customer experience that has you - and your executives - singing, \"Customer Experience IS the new marketing without marketing!\" <br/> <br/> Your customers are only satisfied because their expectations are so low and because no one else is doing better. Just having satisfied customers isn't good enough anymore. If you really want a booming business, you have to create Raving Fans. -Ken Blanchard</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-04 20:34:43.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-04 20:34:43.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_sv3opwB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-is-the-client-experience-end-game/\", \"post_id\": \"5199\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-04 20:34:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-04 20:34:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-is-the-client-experience-end-game\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5198\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2347\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/crazy-fans_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"722\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438771500,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

The problem could lie in your performance evaluation system. Effective leadership is often overlooked as emphasis is placed on the annual performance review. You can take your firm to a higher level of standards and accountability by burying annual reviews and adopting a targeted performance management system.</p><p> Active leadership encompasses a continuous learning and development program with mini reviews throughout the year. Performance management is an essential tool for top performing advisory firms. This requires time and effort, but will improve overall effectiveness and can increase positive outcomes.</p><h3> Why Annual Performance Reviews Don&rsquo;t Work </h3><p> <br/> Annual performance reviews have become a habitual line item in employee handbooks; promising team members one review each year. For most, it&rsquo;s a dreaded process that is done only out of obligation or outdated processes.</p><p> Annual reviews are typically based on a scoring system that provides no direction to employees or the firm. They fail to encourage personal development, damage trust in the workplace, and don&rsquo;t harmonize with the vision, mission, and goals of your firm. Additionally, annual performance reviews hinder the opportunity for managers to provide constructive and valuable feedback that will encourage team member growth.</p><h3> Benefits of Performance Management</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Performance management systems will: </strong></p><li> Encourage personal and team development</li><li> Provide a roadmap for intentional success <br/>  </li><p> <strong>   Performance management will strengthen the foundation of your firm by: </strong></p><li> Ensure goals are consistently met</li><li> Provide focus on fundamental areas in your firm</li><li> Clarify job expectations and responsibilities</li><li> Improve communication</li><li> Compel employee behavior to align with your firm&rsquo;s mission, vision, and goals</li><li> Enhance employee engagement and productivity <br/>  </li><h3> How to Implement a Performance Management System </h3><p> <br/> The process of implementing a performance management system is highly detailed.  Here are a series of steps to get you started:</p><li> Update job descriptions that include the purpose, duties, and responsibilities</li><li> Set performance goals that are measurable</li><li> Prioritize each job responsibility and goal</li><li> Define performance standards for each component within the job description</li><li> Schedule meetings with employees to review performance and provide feedback</li><li> Document a record of performance</li><li> Implement a learning and development program readily available for employees</li><li> Incorporate the opportunity to gather feedback from employee peers and/or clients <br/>  </li><p> Encourage human resource departments, managers, and supervisors to be accountable for performance improvement.  All components in your firm are part of a system that creates value for your clients. The same holds true with a performance management system in that all components must be functioning to create value for your employees and the firm.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-04 20:30:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-04 20:30:12.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_KRVEURT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/which-is-better-performance-management-or-performance-reviews/\", \"post_id\": \"5197\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-04 20:30:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-04 20:30:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"which-is-better-performance-management-or-performance-reviews\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5196\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2346\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438618849391-f906e5dd634f-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"629\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438775100,"author_id":346,"chart_url":""}

Yachts float magically atop the water, while colorful scenes below the waterline mesmerize with their beauty. Still inhabited by a large population of the Carib Indians, Dominica remains the only pre-Columbian native enclave in the Eastern Caribbean, offering both serenity and culture to all who come calling.</p><p> <strong>  From the capital city at Roseau </strong> , to the gorgeous marine reserve at Scotts Head, Dominica&rsquo;s location puts it squarely between two divine neighbors, Martinique and Guadaloupe. The Best of Yachting presents an easy, 7-day itinerary embracing this lovely Caribbean trio, detailing a route that lightens the heart and renews the spirit.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MARTINIQUE-ST.-PIERRE-VIEW-TO-MT.-PELEE.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 1: Launching from Marin Bay </strong> , Fort de France, Martinique, head for the reef at Anse Chaudi&egrave;re, where rewards of colorful fish and corals await snorkel and scuba guests.

Pelee rising up in the background </strong> , cruise up to St. Pierre for a day of diving or snorkeling. More than ten wrecks dot the area, making it a rich underwater experience filled with corals, fish, and interesting artifacts, embraced by the dramatic black sand beach, reminders of the 1902 volcanic eruption that wiped out the town. Today, it is a quiet, charming, waterfront village, welcoming you for an authentic Creole repast at Le Fromager, or the tiny but delicious Le Tamaya.</p><p> <strong>  Day 3: Head to Scotts Head at the southernmost point of the island of Dominica </strong> , a diving, snorkeling and fishing paradise in the Soufri&egrave;re Bay. If you want an onshore excursion, prepare for a super casual atmosphere, Creole cuisine, and minimal amenities, but great food and hospitality. Stop by Roger&rsquo;s Bar, or Malvina&rsquo;s Restaurant for an authentic Creole treat, or package the feast and bring it aboard for a leisurely, luxury lunch. Continue northward to Champagne Reef for a swim or snorkel with the fish and the natural spring bubbles. Cruise on to Dominica&rsquo;s capital, Roseau, for the evening anchorage. If you&rsquo;re craving a slice, Roseau&rsquo;s Sunshine Cottage serves up vegetarian wood-fired pies from scratch.</p><p> <strong>  Day 4: Cruise up the west coast of Dominica&rsquo;s lush </strong> , green hillsides, all the way to Portsmouth, where you&rsquo;ll be welcomed by Cabrits National Park, and a bustling city with a medical school, and a seaport in Prince Rupert Bay.

Famous for their peaks, the two main islands are dotted with seven uninhabited &icirc;lets, mostly surrounded by reefs. Populated by Europeans, and inhospitable to agriculture, the islands are home to quaint, French-speaking fishing villages. An onshore visit to the village of Bourg de Saints for a peek at the galleries, or perhaps for a hike up the mountain to view nature&rsquo;s incredible work from the peak, Le Chameau, 309 meters above the shoreline. The hike can be strenuous, but motorbikes, rented in town, make it a fun, quick trip.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BOURG-DES-SAINTS.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 6: Spend the day wandering through the islands </strong> , snorkeling or diving with colorful corals, fish, and crystal clear blue water, or kite-surf the shallow lagoon. Finish the day with a fine dinner at Auberge Les Petits Saints, where the food and the view are particularly delicious, then retire to the yacht for a lovely night under the stars. Bourg des Saints is reminiscent of St. Barthelemy prior to achieving luxury status. Boutique hotels, unique, local shops, and interesting restaurants dot the island, ready for your explore.</p><p> <strong>  Day 7: Head to the island of Guadeloupe </strong> , stopping at St. Francois for the end of your luxury yacht charter, or continue on for another week, adding Montserrat, St. John, St. Barthelemy, and St. Martin to your itinerary for continued blissful cruising amid the beautiful windward islands of the Caribbean. If the Bas-du-Fort Marina in Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe is your conclusion, head onshore for an exquisite French dinner. Wherever you dine, try the Rhum Agricole, said to provide the joy of the sip without the hangover. Book a table at La Canne a Sucre in Point-a-Pitre for a superb Creole feast with a view, or the epic Marie Galante on Place de la Victoire, both perfect perches to begin planning your next private charter.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-04 17:11:54.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-04 17:11:54.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_a0SZgnG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dominica/\", \"post_id\": \"5193\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-04 17:11:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-04 17:11:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dominica\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5188\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2344\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DOMINICA\\u2019S-CAPITAL-ROSEAU.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1365\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438801200,"author_id":454,"chart_url":""}

However, between one and four years, the client retention rate falls to 74%.</p><p> It is especially important to boost your service efforts during this critical time-frame as well as to demonstrate to the client that you are a trustworthy and caring professional whose knowledge and expertise will guide them to successfully reach their goals.</p><p> But what causes a client to leave an advisor? Research conducted by Financial Advisor magazine found the <strong>  #1 reason that clients leave advisors is failure to communicate on a timely basis.  The #2 reason was listed as failure to understand a client&rsquo;s goals and objectives. </strong> Those clients who are not emotionally engaged with you turn to someone else when life transitions take place.</p><h3> 93.6% of the financial planning process is the behavioral management of the client. </h3><p> <br/> So much of what you need to know about the client&rsquo;s behavior and values is hidden well beneath the surface and takes more than a year to uncover. Yet starting in year 2 is when your relationship is the most vulnerable.</p><p> Knowing these facts, the number one action you can take is to incorporate a behavioral discovery system in your new client on-boarding process. Then build the key behavioral insights into your technology systems (such as CRM) so that they are at your fingertips for every client interaction.</p><p> For example, let&rsquo;s take one simple aspect of your personality and see how that might be perceived by different client communication styles.</p><p> You are an outgoing advisor, high in energy and enthusiasm.  You like to share stories of other people experiences because you feel potential clients can relate to the other people you have helped.</p><p> Your energy and fast paced talking could exhaust a client who is more informational in nature.  It could sound &ldquo;edgy&rdquo; to someone who is more stability oriented.  And to a goal oriented individual you may seem to go on talking forever without ever reaching a point.</p><p> And that is just one aspect of your personality.  Are you still wondering why clients rate &ldquo;failure to communicate&rdquo; as the  #1 reason they leave an advisor?</p><p> Now imagine incorporating a behavioral approach in your practice.  Prior to your first meeting, a new client takes 15 minutes to complete a discovery process.  Your CRM now contains the specific behavioral data points so you know how to adapt your style to conduct the perfect meeting, how to continually service them, and how to create a unique experience for every person in your office who interacts with that client.</p><p> You can create the level of service and communication that actively engages your clients at the very start of your relationship.

{"original_id":2293,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is the Trusted Advisor Still Trusted?","link":"is-the-trusted-advisor-still-trusted","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;The market has changed dramatically,&rdquo; a senior partner at a major law firm recently told me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if clients even want a trusted advisor anymore. Much of the time it just comes down to price. It&rsquo;s discouraging.&rdquo;</p><p> Another client of mine, a senior executive in a large global consulting firm, echoed this sentiment: &ldquo;Selling cycles are much longer that they used to be. Procurement is usually involved, and they can be brutal at squeezing down the price. Sometimes, after you invest a great deal to educate the prospective client, they just decide to do it themselves.&rdquo;</p><p> Since 2008, many business professionals are feeling pummeled by intense price competition and ever-harsher client demands. They are asking:  Is becoming a client&rsquo;s &ldquo;trusted advisor&rdquo; an antiquated aspiration in a world where clients seem mainly concerned with getting the lowest price? Is it still relevant when procurement routinely comes between you and your executive clients? Do relationships, in short, really matter anymore?</p><h3> Do relationships still matter?</h3><p> <br/> The short answer is &ldquo;Yes&hellip;but.&rdquo; For many client executives, the role of trusted advisor is still relevant and valued. Trusted relationships are still very important. And, providers who offer substantial, differentiated value are getting handsomely rewarded for their expertise. There is abundant evidence for this: In even the most cutthroat markets there are competitors who command premium prices.</p><p> For example, in the last year, the number of law firm partners in the US billing more than $1,150 per hour has doubled. In line with that fact, the lawyers who have been able to raise their rates during the recession are the most expensive ones, whereas the most intense price pressure has been at the bottom of the billing rate scale. Remember, value is derived from two terms: Benefits and costs. If you cannot persuasively convince clients about the benefits they will receive, they will try to increase value by cutting your price!  </p><p> That said, market conditions and client buying behavior certainly have changed since 2007. It&rsquo;s tougher out there. To succeed, to have to select your clients carefully, demonstrate value-added at every stage of the client development process, and be more assertive and persistent than before.</p><h3> Now we're going overboard&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not just practicing professionals who are questioning whether trusted relationships still matter. A number of authors and pundits have also jumped on the &ldquo;relationships don&rsquo;t matter anymore&rdquo; bandwagon. In recently months, for example, I have read the following in various books and blogs:</p><p> &ldquo;Relationship-oriented salespeople are the worst performers&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;No client wants a &lsquo;consultative salesperson&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Solution selling is dead&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;No one really values a trusted advisor&mdash;what they want is results.&rdquo;</p><p> I hate to be cynical, but most of these statements fall into the category of trying to grab attention with false contrasts. It&rsquo;s like the newspaper headline that reads, &ldquo;Research proves that loving mothers raise more juvenile delinquents.&rdquo; Then you read the article, and you learn that the mothers categorized as &ldquo;loving&rdquo; were the ones who were so accommodating that they let their kids have booze parties at home starting at age 16! Loving, indeed.</p><p> One recent study, for example, defines relationship-oriented salespeople as those who seek to please their clients, avoid conflicts, don&rsquo;t confront their prospects with hard truths, and so on. But who ever said a trusted advisor did any of these things? Be wary of sensational headlines. </p><h3> Relationships are still important, but you have to get sharper. Here are eight strategies that will help you not just survive but thrive:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. You won't become a trusted advisor to all your clients, but you should still aspire to the role. </strong>  You will not reach &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; status with many of your clients. Even the best firms and professionals have this type of relationship less than 50% of the time. Yet, you must strive for the role. In some ways it&rsquo;s like aspiring to play tennis like Rafael Nadal. If your goal is to beat your aging, out of shape neighbor on the court, you won&rsquo;t have to try very hard and you won&rsquo;t improve much. But if you set your sights high, you will engage much more vigorously in the training needed to excel. You may never compete at Wimbledon, but you will improve your game dramatically and whip your average club opponents. The other side of the coin is that if you don&rsquo;t set your sights high with clients, you&rsquo;ll get marginalized pretty quickly by more aggressive and determined competitors.</p><p> <strong>  2. Improve your advisor skills and you&rsquo;ll be more successful in almost every client situation. </strong>  Below is a list of some the things that a client advisor does. Despite difficult market conditions, do you think these are still important in winning sales and building long-term client relationships? Client advisors:</p><li> Ask great, thought-provoking questions and they are deeply empathetic</li><li> Have selfless independence: They combine client devotion with detachment. They put their clients first but are willing to say &ldquo;No!&rdquo; to them.</li><li> Have deep expertise but also knowledge breadth. Because of this, they can put their specific products and services into the context of their client&rsquo;s broader business.</li><li> Are good at analysis but especially synthesis&mdash;at big picture thinking. They see the trends and make the connections that others do not.</li><li> Go beyond &ldquo;professional credibility&rdquo; and build deeppersonal trust with their clients. They have great integrity, put their client&rsquo;s interests first, and are immensely reliable and consistent.</li><li> Are agenda setters. They don&rsquo;t just take orders. They engage and stimulate their clients with points of view, best practices, new ideas, and so on. They try to shape and drive their client&rsquo;s agenda of key priorities and goals. <br/>  </li><p> These are important skills, period. Here&rsquo;s some data: RAIN Group did a survey of 700 corporate buyers in business to business markets. They were asked what qualities separated out the winners from the second place finishers in competitive bids. What were the number one and number two characteristics of the winners? First, that the salesperson &ldquo;Educated me with new ideas or perspectives&rdquo;; and second, that he or she &ldquo;Collaborated with me.&rdquo; These are exactly the kinds of things a trusted advisor should be doing at every stage of the client development process.</p><p> <strong>  3. For selected clients, be a trusted expert. </strong> Some clients will view you as a narrow supplier and focus on price and execution. So don&rsquo;t over-invest in these situations.  Be realistic: For these clients, you can be a &ldquo;steady supplier&rdquo; who is considered a trusted expert by the client. But you won&rsquo;t be part of the inner circle. If your profit margin from the acount is acceptable, these types of relationships can represent good business for you.</p><p> <strong>  4. Understand that the better your relationship, the more value you have to add. </strong>  Just because you have built a great relationship doesn&rsquo;t mean you can relax.  On the contrary, you have to continually re-earn your client&rsquo;s loyalty by delivering over and over and by adding value and creating results. In a trusted relationship, clients&rsquo; expectations go up, not down! They expect you to work very hard for their love.</p><p> <strong>  5. Choose your clients carefully to match your strengths. </strong>  I spoke at a large sales and marketing conference in Santiago, Chile. I spent time there with bestselling author Neil Rackham (\"Spin Selling\"), a leading authority on selling. One of his key assertions is that the market has segmented into transactional buyers and consultative buyers, and the requirements to succeed in each are quite different. If you provide a high-end, value-added service, you probably aren&rsquo;t going to do well with transactional buyers who only value price. Pick the right clients to invest in, say no to others, and your business will thrive.</p><p> <strong>  6. Build a following.  </strong> An important antidote to difficult market conditions is to build a strong and loyal following. What is your client retention rate year over year? How about over three years? What could drive that figure higher? How would you rate the total &ldquo;client experience&rdquo; that you offer? Would you say it&rsquo;s average? Competitive? Differentiated? Are clients merely satisfied with your work or truly enthusiastic about it and telling others how good you are? Think about how you could create more client enthusiasm, excitement, and passion around your work and your brand.</p><p> <strong>  7. Work at differentiating yourself instead of blaming clients for not understanding how special you are. </strong>  If clients don&rsquo;t see how you&rsquo;re different than your competitors, that&rsquo;s your fault, not theirs. It&rsquo;s a basic principle of economics that when a buyer perceives equal substitutes there will be downward pressure on prices.  There are many, many ways to differentiate, and in every market&mdash;including commodity markets&mdash;there are always competitors who successfully do so. You can differentiate on service levels, methodology, geographic focus, industry specialization, the client experience, relationships, and so on.</p><p> <strong>  8. Treat prospects like clients and old clients like new ones. </strong> The goalposts have been raised. Clients expect more value in the sales process. And, when they have an ongoing relationship with you, they expect ongoing innovation and investment. Be selective about who you target as a prospect, but then treat them like they are already a client. Act like you&rsquo;re already their trusted advisor. Then, treat your long-standing clients like brand new ones&mdash;bring the same enthusiasm, new ideas, and energy to the 100th meeting with a client that you brought when you were wooing them. That&rsquo;s what keeps trust and loyalty strong.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s a much tougher world out there. Yes, sometimes even brutal.</h3><p> <br/> But here&rsquo;s a final reason to keep the faith: Relationships reduce risk and are here to stay. One of the most fundamental benefits of a trusted relationship is risk reduction. A good, trusted relationship reduces the risk of misunderstandings, delivery failures, and missed deadlines. It also enables business to be conducted faster. Clients know this and value it because we live in a world that&rsquo;s more fraught with risk than ever.</p><p> Do relationships still matter?

{"original_id":2292,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Streamline Customer Services through Document Management","link":"streamline-customer-services-through-document-management","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Shareholders Service Group (SSG) was co-founded in 2002 by Peter Mangan and Bob Reed, financial services executives with over 60 collective years of experience in the brokerage services and financial advisor industry. Their goal was to provide high-quality, dedicated services for independent registered investment advisors.</p><p> From the beginning, Laserfiche enterprise content management (ECM) software has provided a technological foundation to help SSG provide that high-quality, dedicated service. &ldquo;Based on our business experience, how paper-intensive our business would be and the necessary controls around that, we knew it was incredibly important to have a well-known, well-respected document management system,&rdquo; says Dan Skiles, executive vice president of SSG. &ldquo;Laserfiche certainly knew FINRA and understood the importance of the documents that we use to run our business.&rdquo;</p><p> Over the past decade, the firm has expanded&mdash;as has its use of Laserfiche to manage its documents electronically. &ldquo;Our business is growing dramatically, and so the scalability and reliability of Laserfiche has been critical to that success for us,&rdquo; Skiles says.</p><p> &ldquo;When we started, we had zero advisors, and today we&rsquo;re pushing almost 1,000. Keep in mind those advisors have accounts&mdash;from as little as four or five to several hundred. Laserfiche has been there with us the whole time,&rdquo; he adds.</p><h3> Content management that improves customer relationships</h3><p> <br/> Key to its usefulness, Skiles says, has been Laserfiche&rsquo;s customizable folder structures, which makes it easy to use in different business units. &ldquo;We have multiple departments&mdash;trading, new accounts, operations, cash management&mdash;all using Laserfiche for their various business processes. And the fact that it&rsquo;s flexible enough to meet their needs, even though their roles and responsibilities are different, has helped us to have a cohesive group responding appropriately to clients as we use their documents.&rdquo;</p><p> Skiles also lauds Laserfiche&rsquo;s ability to manage documents of all types and ages, using various metadata and comprehensive search capabilities. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a heavily regulated business, so yesterday&rsquo;s documents are just as important as today&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The fact that Laserfiche has grown with us, and is scalable and reliable as we grow our staff, has been critical in our overall success.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s this best-of-breed ease-of-use, he says, that has been especially practical when it comes to getting everyone on the same (paperless) page. &ldquo;Certainly one of the things we&rsquo;ve noticed with Laserfiche is how user-friendly it is, so that our staff&mdash;from someone who&rsquo;s been on staff for eight to ten years to someone we just hired as an intern last year&mdash;can immediately be productive,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Because everyone in the firm is responding to clients, a short learning curve is critical.&rdquo;</p><p> The result, according to Skiles, is a foundation for not only managing content, but also relationships. &ldquo;When you run a broker-dealer, your documents are critical. They represent agreements. They represent authority,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;With Laserfiche, with the way we&rsquo;re able to work within the system, we have control of our clients&rsquo; information. They&rsquo;re impressed by our ability to retrieve a document while we&rsquo;re on the phone with them, which ultimately strengthens that personal relationship.&rdquo;</p><h3> Smoother audits</h3><p> <br/> Regulators, too, have been impressed, as they were earlier this year. &ldquo;We had FINRA come in to our office for their regular audit. Laserfiche was such a critical component of that because everything that FINRA wanted related to our documents,&rdquo; Skiles recalls. &ldquo;Everything they asked for&mdash;new account applications, authorizations to do this for a client, this agreement that was established with this client, transfer instructions from other financial services firms&mdash;was in Laserfiche, so we were able to provide it to them electronically.</p><p> The cost of compliance has nearly doubled in the past three years, reaching an estimated annual cost of more than $25 billion, according to the Securities Industry Association&rsquo;s Report on the Costs of Compliance in the U.S. Securities Industry. As Skiles points out, in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, deploying an ECM solution not only improves the bottom line, but also helps simplify audits.</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big deal,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;Let me tell you, when you&rsquo;re sitting there with FINRA and you want to respond efficiently and effectively to their requests, removing some of that anxiety is worth a lot to both your sanity and your sleeping at night.</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we have rules that if it&rsquo;s not scanned, it doesn&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s so critical with our growing staff that we all have access to the same information. Now with nearly 1,000 advisors, we all have access to information at the click of a button.&rdquo;</p><h3> The competitive value of &ldquo;technology strength&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Automating routine, rules-based tasks allows staff at top-performing firms to spend more time serving clients.</p><p> When it comes to ROI, Skiles highlights the availability of information as one of Laserfiche&rsquo;s defining factors&mdash;something that moves beyond getting rid of paper and filing cabinets. &ldquo;Certainly the immediate ROI that comes to mind is not having documents and filing cabinets all over the place. But with a growing firm, the ROI I most appreciate is how quickly we can make an employee efficient. I can hire someone and have them up and running with Laserfiche in less than a day.&rdquo;</p><p> The result, he says, is that SSG has kept operations optimal and compliance concerns to a minimum while also maintaining its competitive edge. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been, obviously, competitive pressure on trading, and then of course the regulations have increased dramatically. What&rsquo;s helped us a lot is technology,&rdquo; he says.</p><p> &ldquo;We took more trades over five days in August this past year than we did the first month that I was at the firm more than three years ago. And what&rsquo;s exciting about that is that our trading desk was able to accommodate those trades just because of technology.

Female financial advisors make up about 8% of the advisory workforce, according to Cerulli Associates data. </p><p> Yet as measured in the 2010 U.S. Census, women outnumber men in every near-retirement age category (from 45 - 69). We are more than 50%. And we live longer. Which makes me wonder, should women look at retirement planning and selecting their retirement age differently than men?  <br/> <br/> After all,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.beliefnet.com/healthandhealing/getcontent.aspx?cid=14693\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   gender-based medicine  </a> </u>  has begun to study how women and men respond differently to the same disease, or metabolize the same drug in a different way, and studies on investor behavior show  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/women-are-better-investors-and-heres-why-2011-06-14\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   women approach investing decisions differently  </a> </u>  than men. Perhaps retirement planning should be viewed differently too.  <br/> <br/> Women, when you are planning your retirement the fact is many of the decisions you make will have a bigger impact on you than on your male counterparts. Here are four things you can do to incorporate planning decisions that are right for you.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Career-based decisions </strong> <br/> <br/> The traditional concept of retirement needs to evolve. Today, a female retiring at 62 might need retirement income that will last 30-plus years. That's a long time. You can save and save for 30-40 years of your life to support a 30-40 year long retirement, or you can try a different approach. </p><p> What about focusing your career in a direction that will allow you to continue to contribute well into your 70's? Find work you thrive on and you'll find a whole new sense of fulfillment. Your 40's, 50's and 60's can be time to dive into your intellectual side. Your retirement plan should include decisions that develop your skills, expertise and earning potential.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Investing decisions  </strong> <br/> <br/> When you are accumulating assets and tossing money into retirement plans, it is natural to go for high returns. As a general rule of thumb, men tend to approach investing from this view point. </p><p> As you begin to make a shift to what is called \"decumulation,&rdquo; the point in time where your money needs to produce reliable income to replace your paycheck, you need a different approach. Women approach investing decisions differently than men and their approach is well suited to evaluate the risk-return trade-offs that are oh-so-important to managing retirement money. </p><p> Women, as you near retirement, take a more active role with your investing decisions. It helps to frame decisions in terms of their impact on your future lifestyle. At a certain point additional returns are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on your retirement security - but big losses can certainly derail your plans.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  3.

They are also likely to be the beneficiary of Social Security survivor benefits one day. </p><p> If you are a married woman the key is going to be making a choice that maximizes your benefits as a couple when viewed over your longer life expectancy. If you're divorced and eligible for benefits on an ex's record, you may be able to claim a spousal benefit for a few years, than switch to your own higher benefit amount when you turn 70. </p><p> For single women not eligible for benefits on anyone else's record, starting benefits later is often your best choice. Women, be sure to take charge of your Social Security claiming options &mdash; and if you're married, don't let your spouse claim without reviewing all your choices in light of their impact over your life expectancy. </p><p> <strong>  4.

{"original_id":2287,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Ways to Enjoy Your Work Most Days","link":"8-ways-to-enjoy-your-work-most-days","source_link":null,"content":"<p> No matter what you do for a living, when you enjoy your work you&rsquo;re going to do a great job&mdash;the best work of your career. Beyond that, you can&rsquo;t help but bring good energy and inspiration to family, friends, and colleagues. Put simply, this is &ldquo;success&rdquo; in a deeper, more sustainable sense than title, power, paycheck or prestige. </p><p> Yet most people settle for jobs that fall far short of &ldquo;happy at work&rdquo; for too many years. In fact, to some, the notion that we can enjoy our work most days, and have both rewarding and fulfilling (and even fun) careers seems absurd. </p><p> That&rsquo;s where I started. Growing up, I heard repeatedly that only &rdquo;the lucky ones&rdquo; get to do work they enjoy, and for everyone else, work isn&rsquo;t meant to feel good. It set me up for my career, as I dutifully made choices that complied with that assumption. </p><p> After 18 years in that mindset, at 41 I realized my heart wasn&rsquo;t in my work. I sought help to change my mind and my professional course. The decision and changes I made, over 11 years ago, added up to my best career move, one I regard with gratitude. I post this to pay it forward by sharing what I learned, and hope you&rsquo;ll find something valuable here:</p><h3> 1. How to measure if your heart&rsquo;s in your work </h3><p> <br/> Of course, you may already have a pretty good idea about whether or not your heart&rsquo;s in your work. If unsure, it&rsquo;s always good to reflect on it. Consider these two key questions to measure it, both on a 10-point scale: </p><p> a) How happy are you most days at work (1 being not at all, and 10 being quite happy)? As you consider this, note that work and life come with painful challenges, so I don&rsquo;t recommend we expect to be happy 24/7; &ldquo;most days&rdquo; is a reasonable goal. </p><p> b) How often are you doing your best work / bringing your &ldquo;A-game&rdquo; (1 being hardly ever and 10 being often)?</p><p> If your combined score is 16 or higher, that&rsquo;s really good news, and you&rsquo;re probably done reading my post. If 15 or lower, it&rsquo;s worth further efforts on your part until your results improve.</p><h3> 2. Your mindset matters</h3><p> <br/> When it comes to the prospect of making a job and/or career change, it&rsquo;s important to understand what may keep you from taking steps forward. Your own mindset is often the biggest barrier to change. &ldquo;I hate it, but at least I know what to expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;Change is risky,&rdquo; &ldquo;Only the lucky ones get to do work they enjoy,&rdquo; &ldquo;What will others think of me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would I be self-indulgent?&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe the grass isn&rsquo;t truly greener,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is all I know,&rdquo; etc. These mindsets are brick walls until you are conscious of them, and practice recognizing and dismissing them as they crop up. Do that, and they transform from walls to doubts to worries to &ldquo;ready to make a change.&rdquo; </p><h3> 3. The mindsets of others will impact you: manage accordingly</h3><p> <br/> When I decided to leave a &ldquo;successful&rdquo; C-level Financial Services job and study to become an executive coach, I heard a lot of things like, &ldquo;Gee, you&rsquo;re brave,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Really? What about your reputation? What will people think?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Maybe you should pick something else in financial services&hellip;&rdquo; and even, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo; Friends, families, colleagues, and even strangers on planes reinforce fears and worries, and may think they&rsquo;re doing us a favor by piling onto our own doubts. Just as important as managing your own mindset, you&rsquo;ll need to avoid taking to heart fear-based &ldquo;input&rdquo; of others when making a major change you think may help you achieve your full potential. </p><h3> 4. Get clear about what energizes, rather than depletes you</h3><p> <br/> Being happy is a form of energy, and like electricity in a battery it can either be charged or depleted. Here&rsquo;s an exercise to help you mind your charging cycle: </p><p> a) Consider your own career experiences you&rsquo;ve found energizing and look for what factors those experiences had in common. What was it about them that fired you up? </p><p> b) Now take a look at your career experiences you&rsquo;ve found depleting&mdash;that left you underwhelmed, anxious, tired, bored, or otherwise less than happy over longer stretches of time. What did those experiences have in common? </p><p> c) Consider your ethics, values, and what &ldquo;being right with my world&rdquo; means to you, and what types of work experiences would be most in tune with those. </p><p> d) Putting a), b), and c) together, what pattern do they make, and what does that pattern tell you about the type of jobs/roles/responsibilities you need to make sure are included to charge you up, rather than deplete you, most days?</p><h3> 5. Set your rules of thumb</h3><p> <br/> Once you understand the patterns of what energizes you (4, above), then it&rsquo;s important to set some rules of thumb in terms of what needs to be true in this new direction, once achieved. I came up with four rules, and have applied them (for example, immediately below) but you need to come up with your own: </p><p> a) The lottery rule: Yes, I would do this type of work even if I win the lottery (although I would probably do it from my lottery-winnings beach house on Kauai&hellip;) For the record, this is still pending</p><p> b) The energy rule: This work energizes me way more often than it depletes me </p><p> c) The gratitude rule: I feel grateful I &ldquo;get to&rdquo; do this work, rather than doing work I &ldquo;have to&rdquo; do </p><p> d) The meaning rule: When I do my work well, it makes the difference in the world I most want to make</p><h3> 6. Be open-minded on outcomes: it&rsquo;ll be what you want, but probably not what you expected</h3><p> <br/> In making my own changes, and seeing those of others, I&rsquo;ve noticed we get what we aim for, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like we thought it would look. Why not? What you think you want now is subject to change. Setting your direction, rules of thumb, and managing your mindset to take steps forward, sometimes you&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;this is what I want, and here&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to look like,&rdquo; and, as the saying goes, &ldquo;No plan ever survived its first contact with reality.&rdquo; It will certainly be different than you thought. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to adjust course to adapt and respond to changing conditions&mdash;both your own, and given how the world is responding to your hard work making the changes you set out to make. </p><h3> 7. Practice the power of patience: Take the long view</h3><p> <br/> In making deeper, more transformational change to find and do work you enjoy most days, it may be quick, slow, or very slow. No matter what, it pays to take the long view and keep at it. When I made my change, people told me, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll take five years for you to hit your stride in your new career,&rdquo; and I wish that had been true. It actually took more like eight years, and I&rsquo;ve taken many detours along the way. Your actual results will vary: Just keep in mind that patience in this is truly virtuous. </p><h3> 8. Aim for your own &ldquo;Quintuple Bottom Line&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t settle for a job you don&rsquo;t like for any longer than necessary. After all, a minimum of five areas improves drastically when you enjoy your work most days: First, the quality of your work improves because you are more motivated. Second, how you show up for your family and friends (as a happier person) is gratifying to them, and is likely to rub off on them too. Third, you inspire others to find and do their best work. Fourth, your colleagues will be incentivized to raise their games. And fifth, you are more likely to make a positive impact on the world because you will be intentional about doing that.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-03 18:29:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-03 18:29:42.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_p5SOjtg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-ways-to-enjoy-your-work-most-days/\", \"post_id\": \"5168\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-03 18:29:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-03 18:29:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-ways-to-enjoy-your-work-most-days\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5167\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2333\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12ad9f4.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"515\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438715700,"author_id":131,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2285,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Ways to Integrate Learning Into Your Week","link":"three-ways-to-integrate-learning-into-your-week","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The character  <a href=\"http://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths#nav\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  strength  </a> <u>  <a href=\"/category/personal-development\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Love of Learning  </a> </u>  involves exploring new topics, mastering new skills, and increasing your knowledge. It&rsquo;s easy to view learning as a discrete event: we read a book or we take a class, for example. But learning can occur at any time as we go about our daily life. Here are three ways to exercise your learning muscle throughout your week. <br/> <br/> 1.       Strive for personal excellence. Rather than seeking &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; or competing with other people, focus instead on becoming the best version of you that you can be. This is one of the reasons I love the VIA Character Strengths so much and why I&rsquo;ve been blogging about them for the last several weeks. Bringing more attention to our character strengths is empowering, energizing, and motivating, and enables us to take our effectiveness to a whole new level. When I feel myself struggling, I can draw upon the strength of learning and ask myself &ldquo;What am I finding so challenging in this situation?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is preventing me from being at my best right now?&rdquo; When I approach these questions from the perspective of learning, I am more open to seeing where the opportunities for change lie. <br/> <br/> 2.       Fully engage with people to learn about them and learn from them. When you&rsquo;re talking to people, make it a goal to learn about them by asking questions and really listening to what they have to say. Just the other day, I was talking to someone I&rsquo;ve known for two years and until that conversation, hadn&rsquo;t realized that at one point in our careers, we had both worked in the same building at the same time.  You can also learn from the people you&rsquo;re interacting with. Over the past week I&rsquo;ve talked to two different people about a particular challenge I&rsquo;m facing and I walked away from each conversation with new perspectives and ideas to consider. Each of these individuals helped me look at my challenge from a different vantage point and their insights were incredibly helpful in me getting one step closer to clarity and resolution. <br/> <br/> 3.       Look for opportunities to try something new. We grow when we encounter new and different experiences and stretch outside of our comfort zone.  Tackling big fears certainly moves us out of our comfort zone, but we are not limited just to those.  We can grow just as much by doing something on a smaller scale. Last year, I made it a personal goal to have at least 40 new and different experiences, which included tackling my big fear of heights by parasailing and tackling smaller fears by trying aerial hammocks, doing hot yoga, and being on the radio. No matter the &ldquo;scale&rdquo; of the experience, I learned something about myself from each new thing I tried. <br/> <br/> What do you do to keep your learning muscle fresh?  Challenge yourself to seek at least one new and different experience this week and see what you learn from it.  <br/>  </p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-03 18:18:06.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-03 18:18:06.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_BPO4wpc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-ways-to-integrate-learning-into-your-week/\", \"post_id\": \"5164\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-03 18:18:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-03 18:18:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-ways-to-integrate-learning-into-your-week\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5163\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2331\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-03-at-11.18.25-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"332\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438707600,"author_id":468,"chart_url":""}

Those competencies included &ldquo;taking initiative&rdquo; and &ldquo;driving for results&rdquo;</li><li> 41% of female managers are engaged at work, compared to 35% of male managers &mdash; regardless if they have children</li><li> Employees who work for a female manager report being more engaged than those with a male manager</li><li> Only one in three working Americans report having a female boss</li><li> 78% of high-level, senior management positions are held by men</li><p> <br/> These statistics show that female managers were more highly rated than male managers by peers, bosses, and direct reports &mdash; essentially at every level. The difference in engagement statistics &mdash; both of the manager and of the manager&rsquo;s employees &mdash; should strike a nerve in all companies. And yet, women aren&rsquo;t holding leadership positions.</p><p> Forbes attributes this fact to the idea that women are less likely to self-promote, and senior-level male leaders are more likely to hire other men. Clearly something needs to be done, not just to put more women in leadership positions they deserve, but to help all underrepresented groups have access to managerial roles, no matter how much they self-promote.</p><h3> There are three things companies can do to help overlooked candidates for leadership positions. <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Build employee recognition into your culture:  </strong> In this case, employee recognition should specifically be geared toward peer-to-peer recognition or values-based recognition. This way, talent acts as the equalizer, and the awards can help point managers to valuable candidates for leadership roles. Peer-to-peer reward programs can also help remove unintended gender or other biases. Values-based programs make reward systematic and even scientific, to achieve the same result.</li><li> <strong>  Create employee resource groups:  </strong> Allow your employees to find support within their own specific communities through employee resource groups, or ERGs, for women, specific ethnic groups, people with disabilities, LGBTQ-identified workers, and other employees who are underrepresented in leadership positions. By building bonds within the company, they can foster a spirit of support and help bring attention to worthy candidates for leadership roles.</li><li> <strong>  Connect people through mentorship programs: </strong>  Open up leadership mentor groups that sponsor, teach, and encourage employees of all backgrounds and genders to rise to management positions. Have coaching groups meet during lunchtime, or build leadership mentorship relationships, one on one, into the company culture. Employees can self-identify, get chosen by managers, or be nominated by peers to join.</li><p> <br/> Despite women possibly having better leadership qualities than men, they are still underrepresented in management positions. There are ways to change that, however, and companies should make that a priority.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-03 18:09:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-03 18:09:51.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_VxqwyVi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/if-women-are-better-leaders-why-are-they-still-underrepresented/\", \"post_id\": \"5162\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-03 18:09:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-03 18:09:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"if-women-are-better-leaders-why-are-they-still-underrepresented\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5161\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2330\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/leader.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2707\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438688700,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2283,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Ace Your Telephone Job Interview in 8 Steps","link":"ace-your-telephone-job-interview-in-8-steps","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;ve written dozens of blog posts related to job interviewing, but I thought it was time to focus on what has become very popular in our time-compressed world&mdash;the telephone interview.</p><p> Companies are using them more often with job candidates and not solely for their first screening attempt. Beyond introductory Human Resources or recruiting calls are technical and competency screens along with many other types.</p><p> To help you with your next phone interview, try these eight steps:</p><p> <strong>  Research&mdash;yourself and the company. </strong> Doing your homework is one of the most critical steps. Conducting your interview without this preparation is like trying to build a house without a blueprint. Most people know to research the employer and its major areas such as company, role, and interviewer. Reviewing these areas will spawn many questions you&rsquo;ll want to ask. Fewer people, however, do enough homework on themselves to know what they want. They also seem to forget how easy it is to forget (ha) their accomplishments. Refresh your memory and outline your responses to the most popular job interview questions. Check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/39-great-questions-ask-job-interview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   39 Great Questions to Ask in a Job Interview  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/the-14-best-job-interview-questions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The 14 Best Job Interview Questions  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/top-12-happiness-factors-employees/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Top 12 Happiness Factors for Employees  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Plan the best environment for the call. </strong> It amazes me how many people think conducting their phone interview in their car while driving or hiding in a stairwell in their office building is &ldquo;suitable.&rdquo; Pick a quiet area. Find a comfortable&mdash;preferably non-moving&mdash;chair that&rsquo;s next to a desk or table so you lay out your notes. I also recommend using a hands-free device so you can take notes and use both hands to shuffle papers. Most importantly, you don&rsquo;t want to sprain your neck.</p><p> <strong>  Smile. Yes. Smile. </strong> I know you&rsquo;re on the phone, but they can see whether you&rsquo;re smiling or not. It&rsquo;s a superhuman power we seem to get whenever we conduct phone interviews. It&rsquo;ll help with your nerves and make you sound smarter and happier.</p><p> <strong>  Show your energy. </strong> Make the interviewer feel you are engaged and interested. While the call is technically an interview, it should feel like a conversation between two parties. Many abrupt starts and stops won&rsquo;t work. Stand during the call if it makes you feel better.</p><p> <strong>  Make yourself memorable. </strong> The interviewer will know whether you&rsquo;re smiling, but might not be able to evaluate whether you&rsquo;re ready and organized. She might also easily forget you unless you make an excellent, memorable impression. One of the easiest ways to do this is by responding effectively to her questions and efficiently asking your questions. I wrote an entire series on the former starting with  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/5-ways-make-people-remember-job-interview-part-1-keep-short-simple/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How to Keep it Short and Simple: 5 Ways to Make People Remember Your Job Interview  </a> </u> . That series includes the five ways to make people remember you positively (continuing with  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/capture-keep-attention-5-ways-make-people-remember-job-interview-part-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   capturing and keeping their attention  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/talk-lingo-5-ways-make-people-remember-job-interview-part-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   talking in their lingo  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/make-believe-5-ways-make-people-remember-job-interview-part-4/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   making them believe you  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/get-care-5-ways-make-people-remember-job-interview-part-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   getting them to care  </a> </u> ). The latter will come from being prepared in the manner outlined in the first step (research).</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t let the interviewer hang up with any doubt you are the right person for the job. </strong>  I think there are very few people in this world that are willing to solely make a decision and take accountability for their choice. It&rsquo;s sad, but true. Interviewers are a reluctant bunch, and they need encouragement from you that it&rsquo;s okay to hire you. I like job candidates to end the interview with a technique I call confirm, assure, and close. Check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/close-interview-ensure-get-job/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How to Close the Interview to Ensure You Get the Job  </a> </u>  for details.</p><p> <strong>  Confirm your interest in the job. </strong> In the previous step, you are confirming that you understand what the employer needs, assuring him or her that you are the right person for the job, and closing with a request for next steps. It&rsquo;s also very important that you confirm that you are interested and want to move forward. As odd as this sounds, interviewers are actually not mind readers and sometimes aren&rsquo;t sure of your interest. Once again, leave no doubt.</p><p> <strong>  Send a thank-you email   and   card. </strong> Stop laughing. The most important aspects of thanking someone are speed and thoughtfulness. An email will provide speed, but it also needs to be thoughtful. Sending someone a card in addition will make an indelible imprint in his or her mind that you took the time and made the extra effort (especially because so few people do this). As an added bonus, the snail mail card will arrive days after the interview. This serves as a helpful reminder to the interviewer who might have interviewed a number of candidates for the position.

As Thomas Stanley, author of the Millionaire Next Door, found in his research, the best wealth accumulators usually assemble a team of advisors when making important financial decisions.</p><p> If you want to build and preserve your wealth, you need a money team, too. When you&rsquo;re talking about something as important as your financial security, it&rsquo;s crucial to get it right. With the right professionals on your side, you&rsquo;ll have peace of mind &ndash; and end up with more in bank.</p><h3> Financial Planner</h3><p> <br/> A financial planner, or financial advisor, will help you look at the entire picture of your financial life. A planner will help you figure out how to accomplish your financial dreams by establishing goals, evaluating your current money situation, and creating a plan to help you get there.</p><p> Even if you like to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-budget-and-manage-your-finances-on-a-variable-income/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   manage your own money  </a> </u> , it&rsquo;s helpful to have a trained eye to look for opportunities and risks you might not see yourself. Sometimes the most valuable thing a financial advisor can do for you is to prevent you from making emotional decisions.</p><p> An advisor can help you with money management,  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/investing-advice-for-newlyweds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   investing advice  </a> </u> , estate planning, insurance planning, business planning, and more. They&rsquo;ll help you pull together the big picture of your financial life, and they&rsquo;ll work with the other members of your money team to help you implement your financial plan.</p><p> When choosing a planner, make sure you look for someone who is fee-only and is willing to work as your fiduciary. They should also have the CFP&reg; designation.</p><h3> Attorney</h3><p> <br/> No money team is complete without the help of a good attorney. An important task for your attorney will be to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/confessions-of-a-financial-planner-my-estate-is-not-in-order/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   create an estate plan  </a> </u> . We all need a will, living trust, and power of attorney.</p><p> These documents help friends and family navigate settling your estate according to your wishes. If you  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/planning-essentials-for-expectant-and-new-parents/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   have children  </a> </u>  that are still dependent on you financially, this is extremely important. You want to make sure your children will be taken care of by a person of your choosing.</p><p> Many of us will want a trust to protect our assets. And this is when having an expert can really help. For example, if you&rsquo;re a doctor with a risk for a malpractice suit, some states have more favorable laws than others. When it comes to estate planning, it&rsquo;s wise to have an expert.</p><p> Depending on your investments and your financial situation, you may call on an attorney on a regular basis. They can help review business deals,  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/saving-down-payment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   real estate purchases  </a> </u> , and more.</p><h3> Accountant</h3><p> <br/> Even if you consider yourself to be good with math, you&rsquo;ll still want an accountant on your team. Many high income earners put  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/taxes-your-fiance-what-changes-after-marriage/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more towards taxes  </a> </u>  than they do towards any other expense.</p><p> With so much money at stake, it makes financial sense to work with an expert on tax strategy. Your accountant can help you prepare your taxes, offer appropriate tax shelter recommendations, manage depreciation schedules, and more.</p><h3> Insurance Broker</h3><p> <br/> The more your wealth grows, the more you have at stake. An insurance broker will help determine the  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/yolo-so-dont-ignore-your-need-for-life-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   right insurance products  </a> </u>  to help you manage this risk.</p><p> Insurance products can be complex. Take  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/disability-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   disability insurance  </a> </u>  as an example. There&rsquo;s a wide range of products and prices available. Since disability insurance depends on your occupation, one person might not even qualify for certain policies. An experienced broker will help you navigate the insurance marketplace.</p><p> Your financial planner and insurance broker will work together to help you create a  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/property-and-casualty-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   comprehensive insurance plan  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Additional Team Members for Entrepreneurs</h3><p> <br/> As a business owner, you&rsquo;ll need a few more people on your money team. For one, you&rsquo;ll want a seasoned attorney that understands your business. Depending on your business, you may need to consult multiple attorneys, such as a contract lawyer, patent lawyer, and so on.</p><p> You might also benefit from working with a bookkeeper. A bookkeeper will help you track your expenses and profits so you can make better money decisions on a daily basis.</p><h3> Build Wealth with a Money Team</h3><p> <br/> A money team is an important part of building your wealth.

However, the iOS platform has a significant lead over the Android platform (77.7% vs. 22.3% penetration).</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=a40307ad-518d-421a-b817-2e9062e0b235&amp;placement_guid=157f1283-a739-4f7c-ac1d-4e5cf0cf420d&amp;portal_id=305003&amp;redirect_url=APefjpGhKK4_tWYnigiWdSiXQ-NAP6e2q2_89Bn8IPPPAjIf7F5J8st6OatEZ9khJElczyDVNFBA3Re9_U3EdGM8ps-i9Cfa1_J7OI4PuppL083SwjhuJbRmx3NWs2b-rK50VOpHn3muQ28sXA7c0Ws3I5gkp-R3z7PA9-9vN63bKKERVfp6BpTWukgVmreRMI_JiFkL1fWDMa6PeL1znZeNDmhAYxxVM5W7oZZHrPoyp2HK7lSnDLr3qT5CUzEzZMEm756-pDj7uujC9m486K8Us-vc7C13urmAIB5tF6O9Il9Y22IJjQlHqCTvkSg8krfP02maw3MN&amp;hsutk=f539e5b784fdee5527ab6158b29f4d57&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fthe-most-popular-mobile-devices-used-by-advisors-at-ria-firms&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fthe-most-popular-mobile-devices-used-by-advisors-at-ria-firms&amp;__hstc=69624975.f539e5b784fdee5527ab6158b29f4d57.1432824585204.1437923994198.1438623201032.9&amp;__hssc=69624975.3.1438623201032&amp;__hsfp=279888592\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Download our free RIA Technology Infographic  </a> </u></p><p> <img alt=\"RIA iPhone vs. Android usage\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/305003/hubfs/Capture_1-6.jpg?t=1438616421506&amp;width=605\"/></p><p>  From there, we look deeper into iOS usage by actual type of iPhone device:</p><p> <img alt=\"IPhone usage by financial advisors\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/305003/hubfs/Upddated_Image.jpg?t=1438616421506&amp;width=629\"/></p><p> By far, the most popular iPhone device (and overall smart phone device) for advisors at RIA firms is the iPhone 6 (42.3% of iPhone users), but not necessarily all versions of the 6; as the iPhone 5S (26.7%) has more adoption than the iPhone 6 Plus (12.0%). Interesting enough, the iPhone 5C (0.1%) falls below the iPhone 4 (2.3%), with the iPhone 3GS (0%) claiming the lowest amount of viewers. The famous iPhone is not the only popular Apple device among advisors, as the iPad also delivers a considerable amount of traffic as well.</p><p> Below is traffic break-down for advisors utilizing an iPad device:</p><p> <img alt=\"iPad usage by financial advisors\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/305003/hubfs/mobile_devices_3.jpg?t=1438616421506&amp;width=630\"/></p><p> Unlike the iPhone, iPad usage by advisors is fairly scattered between newer and older device models. Many advisors are still utilizing older iPad devices having seemingly not felt the need to upgrade. However, it's also important to note that the use of iOS and Android smart phone devices far exceeds advisor use of iPad devices.</p><p> Android users favor a variety of devices with Samsung holding a sizable lead followed by HTC, and finally Motorola.The break down of Android device usage by manufacturer is as follows:</p><p> <img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy usage by financial advisors\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/305003/hubfs/Capture_1-3.jpg?t=1438616421506&amp;width=622\"/></p><p>  </p><p> <img alt=\"HTC usage by RIA firms\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/305003/hubfs/Capture_1-2.jpg?t=1438616421506&amp;width=515\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"Droid usage by financial advisors\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/305003/Capture_1-5.jpg?t=1438616421506\"/></p><p> There are many options when operating an Android system. The most popular Android device used by advisors is the Samsung Galaxy S5 followed by the Samsung Galaxy S4. The Motorola Droid Ultra is also a favored device for advisors. In comparison to all other mobile and tablet devices, views from a Blackberry device was so few that we have omitted it from our data charts. </p><p> Given the increased mobile device usage by advisors at RIA firms to conduct business, it's important for all advisory firms to consider the extent to which the firms' clients may be looking to utilize mobile devices themselves.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/sample-electronic-delivery-authorization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Interacting with clients electronically  </a> </u>  creates additional  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/nasaa-releases-ria-cybersecurity-compliance-survey-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   compliance and cyber security considerations  </a> </u>  that should always be top of mind for RIA firms of all sizes.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-03 17:59:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-03 17:59:08.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_8zR7vnN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-most-popular-mobile-devices-used-by-advisors-at-ria-firms/\", \"post_id\": \"5156\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-03 17:59:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-03 17:59:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-most-popular-mobile-devices-used-by-advisors-at-ria-firms\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5155\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2327\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lead-iphone6.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"673\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438704000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

A good one can help spot leaks in the funnel and can help the business come up with strategies to plug those leaks. A hastily constructed or incorrectly formatted funnel, however, can do more harm than good by missing mistakes or giving false reassurances about the strength of the funnel.  The same principles appliy to the entire process of finding the best matched new job. <br/> <br/> Many people will enter a conversion funnel, but only a few will make it out through the bottom.</p><h3> Know The Elements of the Basic Conversion Funnel</h3><p> <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/03/03/website-conversion-funnel/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   basic conversion funnel  </a> </u>  consists of four phases:</p><li> Awareness</li><li> Interest</li><li> Desire</li><li> Conversion <br/>  </li><p> The first phase, awareness, is when the potential customer first becomes aware of your brand, service or product. This is the largest section &ndash; or top &ndash; of the funnel. The next level, interest, is where potential customers become interested in your brand. This section of the funnel is smaller because most people who become aware of your brand will not become interested in it. The next section tightens even more, where some of the people who are interested in your brand form a desire to purchase your product. In the next phase, conversion, just a few of the people who became aware of your product will take action and convert.</p><h3> Simplify Your Conversion Funnel</h3><p> <br/> As discussed in the article \" <u>  Oops! &ndash; 5 Common Mistakes When Optimizing Your Conversion Funnel </u> ,\" an overly complex website with too many entry points can lead to lost conversions. When websites are too complex, and potential buyers have to travel too far to get from awareness to conversion, the funnel spring leaks, and sales are lost unnecessarily.</p><h3> Test All Changes</h3><p> <br/> When you make any changes, no matter what section of the funnel it affects, always test before you implement. Whether you alter your payment system, your shopping cart, your Facebook ads, your paid tweets, your landing pages or simply a link in a social media post, always test it before it goes live. When a potential buyer clicks a broken link or lands on the wrong landing page, that person ceases to be a potential buyer. <br/> <br/> A good conversion funnel will help you identify where you are losing potential customers and why.</p><p> Conversion funnels aren't actually funnels. In a physical funnel, all of the liquid poured into the top will eventually make it out through the bottom. This is not the case with a conversion funnel. Most of the people who enter at the top will \"leak\" out before they make it to the bottom. But by building a strong conversion funnel you can identify those leaks, leading to more conversions and more sales.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-03 17:52:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-03 17:52:59.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_qPfh87h.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-ways-a-conversion-funnel-can-make-or-break-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"5154\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-03 17:52:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-03 17:52:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-ways-a-conversion-funnel-can-make-or-break-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5153\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2326\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438550005440-ca2422768342-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"623\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438685100,"author_id":161,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2279,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Redefining Discipline","link":"redefining-discipline","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When I think of the word  discipline  I immediately get transported back in time. Images of my ancient First Grade teacher, Mrs. Witts, come to mind. Mrs. Witts with piles of ash blonde hair heaped on the top of her head like old straw, and horned rimmed glasses that were out-of-date, even way back then. Now-a-days they could be considered retro-cool, but there wasn&rsquo;t anything cool about Mrs. Witts. There wasn&rsquo;t anything cool about her pursed lips and rayon dresses. There wasn&rsquo;t anything cool, or warm, for that matter.  I remember her looming over me, like the tall scraggily trees with faces you sometimes see in spooky cartoons.  Her boney fingers splayed like branches, ready to grab me by the scruff and turn me around in my seat for cheerily chatting with my best friend Sally Kay who sat behind me. &ldquo;Mrs. Witch&rdquo;, is what we whispered to one another, giggling. Or, my personal favorite, &lsquo;The Wicked Witts of the West&rsquo;. Mrs. Witch&hellip;er&hellip;Witts was all about  Don&rsquo;t . &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t squirm! Don&rsquo;t talk!&rdquo; (and I was sure she subconsciously lived by  Don&rsquo;t smile . Don&rsquo;t laugh. Don&rsquo;t care ).</p><p> She probably wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I remember, poor woman. She seemed so old. She was probably the same age as I am now (yikes). She seemed so mean. She was probably just at her &hellip;..wits end&hellip;..(we liked that one too). At five years old, I didn&rsquo;t have much compassion for Mrs. Witts. I really don&rsquo;t remember anything we learned that year, except that&rsquo;s where I got my first working definition for the word  discipline . According to our teacher, we, as five and six year olds, were supposed to have  discipline  and be  disciplined , and there was nothing about the way she used that word that made it feel like a good thing.</p><p> Now, truth be told, who knows what Mrs. Witts was really like and what she really said. She was probably a lovely person who just got frustrated with me one day and I stored that in my memory banks as &lsquo;the truth about Mrs. Witts&rsquo;. So, if by some strange circumstance, this post finds its way into the hands of a Witts-relative, I do sincerely apologize. The bummer is, I also stored my belief about discipline in the same file. I&rsquo;m realizing that, perhaps in my five year old zeal to process the world, I made a mistake.</p><h3> What does  discipline  mean to you?</h3><p> <br/> My relationship with writing is a love-hate one. When I do it consistently and regularly, I find that I actually love the process and appreciate the results. When I don&rsquo;t do it consistently and regularly, it feels more like a root canal. Exercise is the same way. When I do it consistently and regularly, I feel great and powerful. When I don&rsquo;t do it consistently and regularly, I hurt. The same could be said for communication, for paying bills, for networking, for eating healthy, and the list goes on.</p><p> For many of us, we associate the word discipline with don&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say this.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;  Don&rsquo;t be this.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat that.&rdquo;  It sounds negative, it feels negative, so no wonder we don&rsquo;t want it. But when I look at the results in my life, when I infuse discipline into my choices and my actions, I start to realize that maybe I need to change my association. Loving the process. Appreciating the results. Feeling great and powerful. Sounds pretty good, doesn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll take more of that!</p><h3> Many of us associate the word discipline with don&rsquo;t.</h3><p> <br/> If we want to be our best, real, most powerful selves &ndash; be the leaders that we&rsquo;re born to be &ndash; we have to do the work consistently and regularly. If it hurts every time we do it, we&rsquo;ll stop. We have to find a way to infuse discipline into our lives.</p><p> What is the impact you want to have?</p><p> How do you want to show up in the world?</p><p> What are the things that you can do consistently and regularly to support you in making the impact you want to have?</p><h3> If we want to be our best, real, most powerful selves &ndash; be the leaders that we&rsquo;re born to be &ndash; we have to do the work consistently and regularly.</h3><p> <br/> If  discipline  becomes your foundation, then it&rsquo;s not about don&rsquo;t - it&rsquo;s the springboard that sets you free.</p><p> Maybe Mrs. Witts was on to something.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-03 17:48:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-03 17:48:35.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_RGTbyVf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/redefining-discipline/\", \"post_id\": \"5152\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-03 17:48:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-03 17:48:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"redefining-discipline\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5151\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2325\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438703025185-2954c4c6baee-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"806\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438794000,"author_id":281,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2278,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Should Be in Your ETF Launch Toolbox","link":"what-should-be-in-your-etf-launch-toolbox","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  Lauren Davis </u></p><p> <strong>  ​In 2014, 180 new ETFs came to market &ndash; that&rsquo;s about one every two days &ndash; and as of June, the ETF universe is now rolling about 1,800 products deep, according to ETF.com. </strong></p><p> Suffice it to say, if you&rsquo;re planning to launch an ETF, you have some steep competition in an ever-increasingly crowded marketplace. Make no mistake: it&rsquo;s imperative that you have a well-crafted plan to attract both media and investor attention right out of the gate.</p><p> Without consciously collecting an arsenal of marketing collateral, story angles and critical information about the fund, your ETF&rsquo;s launch could be yesterday&rsquo;s news before it even happened. Here are the five things you should have in your toolbox before the opening bell rings on your new product.</p><li> <strong>  A website that is equipped for modern marketing.  </strong> Do you have information about your ETF, its holdings, what it tracks (if applicable) and other relevant information on your website so curious media and potential investors can do their research? If the answer is no, you&rsquo;re not ready to go to market.For both compliance and marketing reasons, creating a dedicated website to support your ETF &ndash; or group of ETFs &ndash; is essential. The website should be designed to showcase what is unique about the fund and where it fits in among other offerings. You need to crisply distinguish your new product versus the others out there.In addition, make sure you have analytics set up so you can closely track the traffic to see if page visits spike around the time of the launch. In today&rsquo;s web-driven environment, this should be an automatic, but some fail to make use of the analytics tools at their disposal.</li><li> <strong>  Fact sheet and FAQs. </strong>  Think of your fact sheet as a cheat sheet. What pertinent information about your fund can you fit on a one-pager? Your fact sheet should include the fund&rsquo;s elevator pitch, expense ratio, ticker, snapshot information about holdings, rebalance frequency and index details (if applicable). It probably goes without saying that your fact sheet should be a bit flashy and have some pizzazz to it. Visuals and graphics can be the difference-maker in telling a story in a compressed format.Also, have a list of FAQs on hand in case your phone rings and a reporter is on the other line. What could they ask about your fund &ndash; in particular, what is the &ldquo;gotcha question&rdquo; you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be asked? Make sure you have crisp, concise answers prepared so you capitalize on any and all media attention. Chances are, if a reporter has a question about your fund, there&rsquo;s a potential investor somewhere wondering the same thing.</li><li> <strong>  Competitor differentiators. </strong>  With 1,800 other products competing for investors&rsquo; attention, you should know what makes yours unique and worthy of their money. It&rsquo;s particularly important if there is another fund already trading that is similar to yours in strategy, holdings, sector allocation, etc.You want your fund to stand out, but it&rsquo;s crucial to be able to communicate what makes you different. Why are you an innovator, not a follower? If you have that answer prepared, your ETF launch toolbox is in good shape!</li><li> <strong>  Reporter prioritization list. </strong>  With a new ETF launching on average every two days, it can be hard to catch the media&rsquo;s attention. Instead of hoping for a mass quantity of media coverage, determine which outlets are of the highest priority. Try narrowing the list down so it includes three to five outlets and go from there. As an ETF manager, launch day will be incredibly stressful for you, so you don&rsquo;t want to add &ldquo;Pitch 15 reporters&rdquo; to your already long to-do list.Once you identify your target outlets, make sure you touch base with the reporters 24 hours or so ahead of your launch to give them a head&rsquo;s up of what is coming down the pipeline. That advanced notice could give them the opportunity to clear their schedule so they can plan to cover your launch!</li><li> <strong>  Phase 2 ideas.  </strong> You launched your fund. Now what?While a solid launch plan is critical to a fund&rsquo;s long-term success, you can only ride the wave for so long before investors and the media are captivated by another, newer product.Think about some new angles for your fund to be pitching, both in terms of what might work with the media as well as how your fund might meet current issues concerning investors &ndash; perhaps something cyclical is coming up (i.e. holiday spending is a good period for the consumer discretionary sector) that ties in with your fund&rsquo;s appeal, messaging and offerings. If you go through a launch and then think about phase two, you&rsquo;ll find yourself scrambling and throwing everything at the wall and hoping something sticks. By thoughtfully thinking through the launch with an eye toward the long-term, you will be able to transition much more seamlessly on from the launch phase.</li><p> <br/> Launching an ETF can be stressful, but by planning ahead and making sure you are prepped with the right information, message and strategy, you can ensure it goes off without a hitch and receives the attention it deserves.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-03 17:47:11.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-03 17:47:11.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_1bpDfMT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-should-be-in-your-etf-launch-toolbox/\", \"post_id\": \"5150\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-03 17:47:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-03 17:47:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-should-be-in-your-etf-launch-toolbox\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5149\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2324\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-03-at-10.46.17-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"468\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438689600,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2276,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Empathy Is Key to Life and Work","link":"why-empathy-is-key-to-life-and-work","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Throughout our lives, people come in and out. They come to teach us by adding to our lives or making a mess in our lives. Society conditions us that there are rules of how we should act and play. Don't you know what's cool and uncool? Acceptance and love should be the norm and it does not prepare us for when some people disappoint us deeply, especially ones that we trusted.</p><p> What I personally love about life is that every person is an individual, different and unique. Our society shies away from the people who are different and considered \"misfits\" and puts them in boxes with labels that say they are the \"crazies.\" Isn't that what Steve Jobs was labeled when he was alive? And now that he is no longer on earth, he is seen as a hero being quoted almost every day in some form or another.</p><p> And here is the secret that Seth Godin understands and talks about and so does John Hagel, the opportunities for us today in life and business are on the edge.</p><h3> Most people have not received the bulletin that the bell curve is dead.</h3><p> <br/> Thanks to technology our society is changing and so is business. We no longer need to mold every human being into a perfect cookie and the same applies to organizations. We are at a point of transformation as a result of technology. The gift of technology is that we are now visible. And while that scares senior management, because their role as the information sources is shifting to one of a community builder, it is the new reality that is happening whether they like it or not. It's no longer a matter of if it would happen, but that it is happening.</p><p> And it is very scary for people who go to a self-help book to discover the seven secrets of success and how they should be living their lives. They want to know what the cool clothes are too wear and where they should vacation because it's trendy. Easy access to information has moved us to live in a global world. Often, we hear of events in far away lands faster than the traditional news media can report. CNN today reports on what is happening on Twitter.</p><p> There are also people who hide behind technology. That is part of the human condition, But what it is bringing about is a fundamental shift of the many types of people out there who are unique and individual. And that's ok. Today many prefer to belong to their community or tribe and no longer have to \"fit in\" to society's conditioning of how their lives are supposed to be. This is the fundamental discourse we are witnessing between the generations at home and especially at work. The younger generation is rejecting how it is \"supposed to be\" to create what they want it to be. Their world was smaller and more connected as they have always had technology.I'll never forget running a workshop at Usher's New Look Foundation and many of the participants connected with me on Facebook and were amazed that we had common connections in Kenya. They tend to see their lives more as a blank canvass. They want to show up as who they are and it is annoying to many in the older generations who have been conditioned to be a certain way, with a certain path and formula to follow; and who may be living someone else's \"best practice.\"</p><h3> The Big Shift</h3><p> <br/> The big shift that is happening in all generations is a massive wake-up call to what is possible. I like to call it a shift from how we have been conditioned to be to a pure \"unconditioning.\" There is a reason why this word appears unfamiliar and I am being told it's a spelling error. Some of us, regardless of our age, are now also rejecting how life is supposed to be to create the life we want. We are still viewed at the edge but we don't really care. We want to own our lives and be able to be the artists with our own paint colors and we don't see ourselves as brave or courageous as we are being labeled but at peace with who we are becoming. We don't care if we are labeled misfits or crazies because we know who we are. And more importantly, we are focused on how we can help others with compassion and understanding, when they are ready. It can be a very lonely and misunderstood place but we are pioneers. And we know it's not easy, because we are unconditioning, but what we feel it needs to be for us in our own individual way. We don't believe in best practices. We seem them as a distraction.</p><h3> Why Empathy is Key</h3><p> <br/> We live in a world where humans judge each other every second. Many can only relate to their own path of how people should show up. Some action of another person can trigger something deep inside of them that they then reflect back on themselves without seeing the person right in front of them. Our society recognizes the mind and the intellect more than our hearts and our feelings. Our human communication is broken. It happens every day in organizations where we over-complicate basic information we need to share. We are so busy presenting our perfect mission and vision statements that we have lost sight of the shared purpose that allows people to understand how they can make a contribution at work. And pure communication becomes even messier in our personal relationships.</p><p> The irony is that we then take it into social networks by having superficial applications of \"likes,\" for example, which are meaningless. Apart from advertising, what is a like worth? Does it matter if you are more liked than someone else?</p><p> What we are missing is conversations with pure empathy. Everyone wants to help us solve our issue or what they perceive it to be, but they don't always take the time to deeply listen and understand it. They go back to the manual and think they know the answer without taking the time to listen. And that causes further miscommunication because they apply diagnoses that don't really apply. What happens is that everyone is then frustrated. They are frustrated that the individual can't see what is in front of them and the individual is frustrated that they want to label them and have not listened.</p><p> The 21st century is about the individual who wants to be on the edge and not pretend that there is a bell curve that they need to fit into. It's an opportunity for an increasing number of people to be creators and makers of their lives, which includes what they do at work. Organizations that will understand this shift will realize that work-life balance is a 20th century myth based on the notion that we were two separate people: professional and personal. In the 21st century, an increasing number of people want to show up as themselves and lifework. In the 20th century, we asked the question: \"What would you do if you had six months to live?\" This is a scarcity question. In the 21st century, we can ask: \"What would happen if we had 100+ years to live?\" This is an abundance question that recognizes that we live in opportunity and possibility.</p><p> My request is that we take more time to see the person in front of us as it will help us understand ourselves, our community and our customers better. Don't get stuck in old frames of reference that no longer serve you. Take the time to listen and learn. We may all learn something important not just about the other person but ourselves. It's not always pretty but why does it need to be? Just like 120 crayon colors, the human being comes with a range of emotions that serve a purpose that only the creator understands.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 22:09:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 22:09:08.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_Hig2dal.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-empathy-is-key-to-life-and-work/\", \"post_id\": \"5146\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 22:09:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 22:09:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-empathy-is-key-to-life-and-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5145\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2322\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-01-at-3.11.06-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"451\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438614000,"author_id":48,"chart_url":""}

Writing topical content starts with understanding the trending topics. Stay up to date on current events, trends and headlines. Check your favorite news outlets,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Trends  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Huffington Post  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">   CNN  </a> </u>  or services like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.iconoculture.com/US/Index.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CEB Iconoculture  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://trendwatching.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   trendwatching.com  </a> </u>  to understand what&rsquo;s happening today and what might be coming tomorrow.</p><h3> You can&rsquo;t write about what you don&rsquo;t know or understand.</h3><p> <br/> Once you have a handle on what&rsquo;s going on in the world, start looking for overlaps with your expertise. Find a relevant way to comment on a trending topic through the lens of your brand.</p><p> If you look at the Oreo campaign, their brand is about celebrating the child in each of us. Every one of their daily twists featured a fun commentary created from Oreo Cookies. They used their brand to comment on current events, celebrate milestones, anniversaries and even endorse marriage equality.</p><h3> What you don&rsquo;t say can be as important as what you do say</h3><p> <br/> Simply sharing your point of view isn&rsquo;t always enough; you need to find a connection to your expertise. Oreo&rsquo;s expertise is fun, so they focused on pop culture. An IT solutions company doesn&rsquo;t have the same opportunity. On the flip side, Oreo Cookie doesn&rsquo;t have any credibility when it comes to the latest Windows Update or an evaluation of the most popular apps in the iTunes store.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get sucked into every trending topic and cultural fad; focus on the ones where you can insert your brand and add value to your reader.</p><p> Recently, an airport parking website used a man&rsquo;s death to promote their services. They  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/09/23/airport-parking-death/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sent an email  </a> </u>  citing that &ldquo;trouble finding a parking spot contributed to the man&rsquo;s death&rdquo; and then offered a discount at the end. And while it was certainly a topical content, it was horribly insensitive, tacky and had nothing to do with their business or expertise.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.budweiser.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Budweiser  </a> </u>  on the other hand once again hit gold, using emotion in their &ldquo; <u>  Friends are Waiting </u> ,&rdquo; PSA to promote responsible drinking.</p><p> &ldquo;Budweiser is known for connecting with beer drinkers in memorable ways, and our efforts to promote responsible drinking through this video are no exception.&rdquo; Brian Perkins, VP of  <u>  marketing, </u> told  <u>  <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/see-the-spot/budweiser-drunk-drivers-kill-puppy-love/295058/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AdAge  </a> </u> .</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve found the intersection of your brand&rsquo;s expertise and today&rsquo;s trending topic, all that&rsquo;s left is figuring out what you&rsquo;ve got to offer.

Even the method to calculate your eligible benefits involves a series of complex calculations. <br/> <br/> In it's simplest terms, your benefits are based on your highest 35 years of averaged indexed monthly earnings (AIME).  Social security records your highest 35 years of earnings, indexes them into present day values and then calculates a monthly average. <br/> <br/> But they don't stop there. To determine your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), the monthly benefit you will be eligible to receive at full retirement age (age 66 for most retirees today), they then apply three \"bends points\" to your AIME in order to calculate your PIA. For example, if your AIME is $9,000 in 2015, in order to calculate your PIA they take 90% of the first $826 of AIME, then 32% of the next $4,154 and then 15% of any amount above $4,980. Wow! <br/> <br/> So what's the point of knowing the inner workings of your PIA calculation? Well, if you are a police officer, fire fighter or any other worker (such as some teachers and government workers) who have a social security benefit and also contribute to a non-covered pension then this becomes an important matter indeed. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Social security benefits were designed to replace a percentage of a workers earnings. </strong>   It was also designed to afford a lower wage earner a higher percentage of their pre-retirement earnings than it does for high wage earners. In general, it is designed to provide lower wage earners with about 55% of their pre-retirement income compared to about 25% for higher paid workers. <br/> <br/> However, an inequity in the system arose regarding workers whose primary income was from a job where they didn't pay into social security while still working for a smaller income from a social security covered job. Because their recorded social security earnings were low they were being treated as a low income earner (even though their total combined earnings were high) and, as such, were paid a higher percentage of replacement income from social security than they should be paid. <br/> <br/> These workers were deemed to be \"double dipping\", having an unfair advantage over workers who had the same amount of aggregate income but worked only in a job (or jobs) where they paid into social security on all of their earnings. <br/> <br/> As such, in 1983 Congress passed the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) to remove that advantage. The WEP in these cases reduces the PIA to create a level playing field between those whose work history includes both covered and non-covered employment and those who work exclusively in covered positions. <br/> <br/> Without getting into the complex details of the calculations involved in applying the WEP, one point to note is that the first \"bend point\" could drop to as low as 40% from 90%.  Therefore, the effect of the WEP could reduce an affected worker's social security benefit by as much as $400 per month or more. In addition, it also reduces the amount a spouse would be eligible to receive for spousal benefits affected by WEP. The combination of both reductions could substantially reduce a couples social security benefits in retirement. <br/> <br/> Separately and in addition to the WEP, there is yet another provision called the Government Pension Offset (GPO) which also affects these same workers who have social security and non-social security covered wages. The GPO will be the topic of my blog next week but it's impact could be as important or possibly more important than the WEP. <br/> <br/> So, is there any way to mitigate the effects of the WEP? Yes, in some cases it may be possible but to do so involves a detailed understanding of the rules and careful planning. <strong>  If you are a police officer, fire fighter, government worker, teacher or other type of worker who does not pay into social security then it critical to know exactly how your social security benefits may be affected by the WEP.  </strong> With the assistance of a social security income specialist you may be able to reduce or perhaps even eliminate the impact of the WEP.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 21:45:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 21:45:12.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_XxZAbR4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/no-double-dipping-allowed/\", \"post_id\": \"5142\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 21:45:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 21:45:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"no-double-dipping-allowed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5141\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2320\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-01-at-2.46.11-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"956\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438629300,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}

I even remember one government employee who insisted anyone who obtained wealth had to do so illegally.</p><p> While a few people become rich in these ways, they are the exception rather than the rule. A survey by the <u>  <a href=\"http://www.spectrem.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Spectrem Group  </a> </u> asked 132,000 people with a net worth of over $25 million where their wealth came from. Here are the results:</p><li> <strong>  Hard Work, 87%. </strong> The majority obtained their wealth by working hard. Most millionaires put in long hours, often in careers they love enough so that work becomes play.</li><li> <strong>  Education, 78%. </strong> Certainly, people with college educations earn more than those without. However, the right type of education for building wealth may not be found in a college curriculum. For example, I know one person with no college degree who took the equivalent of 75 credit hours of real estate education and amassed large real estate holdings.</li><li> <strong>  Smart Investing, 72%. </strong> Don&rsquo;t confuse smart investing with sophisticated investments. It&rsquo;s just not that hard to invest smartly: start young, invest regularly, don&rsquo;t speculate, diversify your investments over multiple asset classes and multiple securities, reduce fees and minimize taxes, and don&rsquo;t time the markets.</li><li> <strong>  Taking Risks, 63%. </strong> I would add, \"smart risks.\" Actions like starting a business, buying into the company you work for, relocating your family to a city with brighter prospects, changing careers, or borrowing to purchase investment real estate all carry with them a certain degree of risk. And with risk inevitably comes failure. In The Millionaire Next Door, Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko point out that the average millionaire makes 3.1 major financial, career, or business mishaps in a lifetime, while the average non-millionaire makes 1.6 such mistakes.</li><li> <strong>  Frugality, 59%. </strong> I&rsquo;ve often called this the common denominator of people that have wealth. My guess is that it didn&rsquo;t rank higher only because many wealth builders don&rsquo;t view themselves as frugal. They tend to not have written budgets, they don&rsquo;t shop at thrift stores, they buy name brands, and they spend everything in their checking account. But what they forget is that they pay themselves first, which includes paying all their bills and taxes, spending heavily for education, and investing 20 to 50% of their paycheck. Then they blow what's left. I call that frugality.</li><li> <strong>  Being in the Right Place at the Right Time, 56% </strong> ; and</li><li> <strong>  Luck, 53%. </strong> Of course circumstances and luck&mdash;factors like timing, knowing people who can help you, and being blessed with abilities and good health&mdash;play roles in building wealth. What also matters, however, is being prepared to take advantage of favorable circumstances.</li><li> <strong>  Running a Business, 46%. </strong> This fits closely with reason number one: working hard. When you work hard and take smart risks in your own business, you go beyond earning a substantial salary. You build a valuable asset.</li><li> <strong>  Guidance of an Adviser, 35%. </strong> Part of reason number three, smart investing, is being smart enough to learn from skilled mentors and advisors.</li><li> <strong>  Inheritance, 30%. </strong> Yes, inheritance is one source of wealth. I'd suggest that most of the inheritors who are able to keep and build on that wealth do so because of factors like hard work, education, and smart investing.</li><p> <br/> <strong>  It appears that success in building wealth is similar to success in other areas: the harder and smarter you work, the more success you are likely to have. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 21:30:54.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 21:30:54.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_cyzYXGT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-the-rich-got-rich/\", \"post_id\": \"5140\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 21:30:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 21:30:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-the-rich-got-rich\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5139\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2319\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438354886727-070458b3b5cf-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"736\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438599600,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2271,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Build Relationships with Content Marketing","link":"how-to-build-relationships-with-content-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In all the hustle and bustle of content marketing mania, I think there is something very important that is being overshadowed by the overemphasis on performance, results, and tracking ROI. Being able to build real relationships with your content marketing efforts IS the objective in and of itself, wherefore all other tactics and tracking converge and align. If your content isn&rsquo;t connecting with people, all the other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that makes content marketing so attractive and successful won&rsquo;t perform according to expectations.</p><p> Content marketing is a customer-centric approach to marketing for a reason. It acknowledges the importance of creating value for an audience, because that helps to establish trust and when there is trust, there is also the higher likelihood that someone will purchase from you. This mindset is very familiar to those of you in the professional services whose entire business relies on healthy client relationships based on a foundation of trust.</p><p> For this reason, businesses should be using content marketing with the goal of building relationships, not just increasing transactions.</p><p> Here are a few ideas to help illustrate what application of this goal looks like:</p><h3> Know Who You Want to Build a Relationship With</h3><p> <br/> Without trying to sound like a broken record, who do you want to cultivate a relationship with? Content marketing works, because it tailors content to a specific audience. Specific. This requires that you have a firm understanding of your client base. But beyond an understanding of your entire client base, are there specific individuals in your prospect pipeline you are currently pursuing? Are there people in town that you would love to have as a client? Perfect! Now you&rsquo;ll be able to craft content with a specific audience in mind.</p><p> I met with a new client last week, and I was in awe at how he built his financial business. When he was just starting out, he had a list of names of people he wanted as clients&hellip; and he pursued them individually and directly. What he did is exactly what you want your content to do, but on a larger stage.</p><h3> Solve Their Problem BEFORE Asking for Their Business</h3><p> <br/> The great value of content marketing is that it allows you to deliver solutions to your ideals clients before they are actually paying customers. This is especially beneficial for businesses with a longer sales cycle that requires more time to establish trust and relationship building in order for a client to feel comfortable engaging.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t give everything away, but think about all the questions you&rsquo;ve gotten from clients and patients over the years. With digital channels at your fingertips, now you can answer those questions on your website, in blog posts, presentations and guides. You are a wonderful resource already and now you have the ability to help answer common questions by your ideal clients where they are looking: online.</p><p> By doing this, you are able to attract the attention of your ideal client and are already cultivating a healthy relationship through the content that helped your audience. This is the very beginning of establishing trust and it builds your credibility.</p><h3> Make It Easy For People To Connect With You</h3><p> <br/> Content marketing doesn&rsquo;t just want to stop at creating content that identifies and attracts your ideal client. It is working hard to connect people with your business&hellip; and you. Therefore, make it super easy for people to reach you. If you are creating content that your audience wants, they will be willing to share their contact information with you&hellip;why? Because they trust you.</p><p> So go on and make it easy. Their first inclination probably won&rsquo;t be to come in for a free consultation, so don&rsquo;t rush it. All relationships take time, so continue to woo your audience. Be sure to include a blog subscription opt-in on every blog post and on your website. Or hide a valuable piece of content like an ebook, presentation, or checklist behind a web form that people will fill out to receive higher value content.</p><p> Provide people multiple ways to connect: phone number, email address, social media accounts, web forms, and newsletter and blog subscription sign-ups. Let your audience make themselves known to you.</p><h3> Make a Personal Connection, Don&rsquo;t Just Sell</h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;ve made it to the critical crossroads of content marketing. You have the contact information of people who have been attracted to your content and your business. Now what? Now you show up in a personal way. At this point, don&rsquo;t just rely on marketing automation to keep these interested people engaged. Marketing automation should be used to complement and support your relationship-building efforts.</p><p> Marketing automation will work to further individualize the content to your audience&rsquo;s needs and interests based on how you segment your contact list. Marketing automation probably won&rsquo;t be enough for someone to be willing to sign-up and engage for you to manage their assets, do their taxes, sell their home or represent their legal interests. So why not take some time every week to review your list of contacts and send them a personal message? Introduce yourself. Thank them for their interest. Ask them for their feedback.

As in,</p><p> &ldquo;I should replace that burned out light bulb.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I should exercise more often and eat better.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I should make the time to get a handle on my money life.&rdquo;</p><h3> We are all full of the &ldquo;shoulds&rdquo;. They plague our existence with a daily dose of guilt and dissatisfaction.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Must&rdquo; however, is full of strength and determination. It&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s-no-choice-here word. &ldquo;I MUST take out the garbage&rdquo; vs &ldquo;I should take out the garbage&rdquo;. Livable home vs rat-infested disease and squalor. Quite a difference.</p><p> So how do you make that transition from the lazy-would-be-nice-if &ldquo;should&rdquo; and the powerful, can-do laser-focused MUST with your money?</p><p> Start with the declaration of your choice. For example, &ldquo;I must get out of debt&rdquo; or &ldquo;I must increase my financial literacy&rdquo; or &ldquo;I must spend less and save more for retirement/college/house down payment.&rdquo; Pick the one that rings truest for you.</p><li> <strong>  Articulate your MUST </strong> and talk it over with your partner, spouse or significant other(s) who are impacted. Make sure their voices are heard.</li><li> <strong>  Answer the WHY question. </strong> Why is this a MUST? What happens if it doesn&rsquo;t happen? If it&rsquo;s changing a light bulb, your biggest downside is being in the dark. If it&rsquo;s your retirement or getting out of debt, the stakes are a bit higher, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</li><li> <strong>  Write it down. </strong></li><li> <strong>  What needs fixing or changing? </strong> Determine what the problem really is. It could be your spending habits, or maybe you need to look for a new job or even a second job temporarily to move the needle. Perhaps you are overwhelmed with debt and you don&rsquo;t know how to fix the problem. Or you&rsquo;re a wiz at building savings, but have no idea how to invest to meet your goals.</li><li> <strong>  Who can help you make the change? </strong> Is the right person a Fee-only Financial Planner or do you need to take an adult learning course in financial management? Knowing who the experts are is more than seeing designations after their name. There are stockbrokers and insurance salespeople who are Certified Financial Planners(TM), but that designation means only that they&rsquo;ve passed the requisite exams and take continuing education. Make sure you find professionals who can actually help without a sales agenda.</li><li> <strong>  Creating change is all about courage </strong> , commitment and consistency, which are best accomplished in a step-by-step approach. So before you sell your house and move into a tent to save money, examine where you can make cuts to discretionary expenses. Here&rsquo;s a hint: no one needs 500 cable channels. You don&rsquo;t need a $250 deductible on your car insurance if you have enough savings to cover the deductible. And you don&rsquo;t have to eat out seven days a week if you have more pressing uses for your money.</li><li> <strong>  Set up a process that supports your decisions. </strong> For example, if you cut your expenses by $100, you actually need to do something with the savings. And it needs to happen pretty easily or you won&rsquo;t do it&mdash;set up automatic savings or investment plans that make it simple.</li><li> <strong>  Chart your progress. </strong> If your goal is to pay down debt, then create a spreadsheet where you can chart your progress each week. The same applies for savings or other goals. It&rsquo;s like stepping on the scale and seeing that you lost weight&mdash;each small success builds on itself.</li><li> <strong>  Keep your stakeholders (spouse, partner, significant other(s), etc.) involved </strong> in the process and progress. <br/>  </li><p> By making strong decisive steps to move from &ldquo;should&rdquo; to &ldquo;must&rdquo;, you shift your beliefs about yourself and what you can accomplish. It is no small feat, but it&rsquo;s well worth the steps necessary to take control of your financial life. Think about it&mdash;you really should.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 15:58:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 15:58:58.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_A84Sw1t.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/nine-steps-to-turn-your-money-shoulds-into-action/\", \"post_id\": \"5134\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 15:58:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 15:58:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"nine-steps-to-turn-your-money-shoulds-into-action\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5133\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2316\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1437350692737-1e991c59d272-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"510\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438621200,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2269,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Qualify Prospects without Interrogating Them","link":"how-to-qualify-prospects-without-interrogating-them","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Qualifying prospects during the initial call is one of the most important things you can do in sales </strong> , but for anyone who&rsquo;s done it, you know that what&rsquo;s difficult is asking a series of good questions without sounding like you&rsquo;re interrogating your prospect.  Admittedly, there is a fine line between having a dialogue with someone and asking enough questions to see whether they qualify for your product and service, but how exactly do you do that?</p><p> It&rsquo;s easy if you follow the steps below. Remember to always feel free to customize these questions to suite your personality and your product or service:</p><p> <strong>  Step One: </strong>  The first thing you need to do is frame an opening question that gives you the right to continue asking questions. Strange, I know, but the key word here is &ldquo;frame&rdquo; your question to earn the right to qualify. Here are some examples:</p><p> &ldquo;_________ would it be O.K. if I asked you just a couple of quick questions to see if this would be a fit for you?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;_________, it sounds like this might work for you; do you mind if I ask you just a few questions so I can find the right fit?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;__________, I know you&rsquo;re busy, and I&rsquo;ll be brief. There&rsquo;s just a few questions that will help give me an idea of what best to focus on when we next speak &ndash; do you have just a couple of minutes for me now?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;__________ let me get a clear idea of just a couple areas of importance for you, and then I&rsquo;ll be in the best situation to tailor a demo for you next week.&rdquo; <br/> OR</p><p> &ldquo;_________, would you mind if I took a few minutes to ask you a couple of questions so I can understand exactly what you might need, and how we can help?&rdquo;</p><h3> Framing your qualifying questions in this way always gives you some leeway in where to start and what to start asking.</h3><p> <br/> It also sets the right expectation for your prospect, and earns you a window to begin the qualification process.</p><p> <strong>  Step Two:  </strong> The way to seamlessly continue the qualification process is to use layering questions, when appropriate, to drill down on some of your prospect&rsquo;s answers. Layering questions are simply questions that tag on to the previous question, and they are used to get even more information on a specific area.</p><p> Most sales reps have never taken the time to learn the fine art of the layering question, and haven&rsquo;t developed the ability to truly listen enough which is a prerequisite for using them effectively. If you&rsquo;re willing to learn and use them, though, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with a wealth of information which will make the closing process that much easier. Here&rsquo;s some examples:</p><p> Question: &ldquo;And besides yourself, who else weighs in on the decision?&rdquo;</p><p> Layer: &ldquo;And how do you figure in to that?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> Layer: &ldquo;And how much influence do they have?&rdquo;</p><p> Another:</p><p> Question: &ldquo;In terms of budget for this, how would our solution at (your price point) fit in right now?</p><p> (If their budget is tight right now, or they are not sure, then use:)</p><p> Layer: &ldquo;What other department or bucket could you get the budget from if you really liked this?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> Layer: &ldquo;When you find something that you absolutely must have, where do you borrow the budget from?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;How have you made something like this fit in before?&rdquo;</p><p> Another:</p><p> &ldquo;What one thing can you think of that might prevent you from moving ahead on this in the next two weeks?&rdquo;</p><p> Layer: &ldquo;And how would you get around that?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;How have you been able to side step that in the past?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;And what would you propose to do if that happens?&rdquo;</p><p> As you can see, with the proper use of layering questions, you will not only learn more information about the important qualifying areas, but you&rsquo;ll also be able to seamlessly continue the conversation. Layering questions allow you to extend the qualification phase naturally as each question is a continuation to the question that was asked previously.</p><h3> This is the way you&rsquo;ll earn the right to continue qualifying without sound like you&rsquo;re interrogating someone.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Step Three:  </strong> Address any Red Flags that come up during the process. One of the biggest problems sales reps run into is hearing possible problem areas come up and not addressing them. Many sales reps just hope these problems will go away or not come up again, but if they&rsquo;re honest, they know they never do. In fact, the truth about Red Flags is that they almost always come back up and often tend to ruin the deal in the end.</p><p> By addressing them when you hear them, you not only have a chance to qualify them, but you also earn the right to keep asking questions while keeping your prospect engaged. Here are some examples:</p><p> Red Flag: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll have to run this by corporate.&rdquo;</p><p> Ask: &ldquo;What has their answer on something like this been in the past?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;And what do you think the chances of them approving this is?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Based on where you see them leaning, what do you think they&rsquo;ll say?&rdquo;</p><p> And then:</p><p> &ldquo;How can we best get them to approve something like this?&rdquo;</p><p> Red Flag: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting several quotes on this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Ask: &ldquo;Which one do you like best so far?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;What does the winning quote have to look like from your point of view?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Our price point on this will be X. How do you think that will stack up with what you&rsquo;re willing to spend on something like this?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;And what do you think they&rsquo;ll need to see to pick us?&rdquo;</p><p> Red Flag: &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re in no hurry on this.&rdquo;</p><p> Ask: &ldquo;And what is your realistic time frame like?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;What might change that?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to motivate the decision to finally act on something like this?&rdquo;</p><p> As you can see, asking questions of prospects &ndash; without sounding like you&rsquo;re interrogating them &ndash; is easy if you take the time in advance to prepare the right kinds of questions. And don&rsquo;t forget why you&rsquo;re asking all these qualifying questions: 80% of the sale is made during the qualification call. If you do this part of the process correctly, then your closing percentage will go up effortlessly. And if you don&rsquo;t thoroughly qualify, then you&rsquo;ll likely just continue putting unqualified leads into your pipeline, and you already know how that turns out&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  So reframe the prospecting call and learn how to earn the right to ask </strong> , and continue asking, qualifying questions without sounding like you&rsquo;re interrogating a prospect. As you can see, it&rsquo;s easy if you know how.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 15:40:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 15:40:05.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_Ms9nFnX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-qualify-prospects-without-interrogating-them/\", \"post_id\": \"5132\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 15:40:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 15:40:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-qualify-prospects-without-interrogating-them\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5131\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2315\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1437357380186-d84494521acb-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"458\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438602300,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2268,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Vulnerability —The Road To Courage And Success","link":"vulnerability-the-road-to-courage-and-success","source_link":null,"content":"<strong> When people meet me, they expect me to have the kind of bravado that is portrayed by FBI agents on TV and in movies&mdash;confident with no signs of weakness or vulnerability. Nothing could be further from the truth!</strong>The happiest and most successful FBI agents with whom I worked alongside had the self-awareness to know that it takes a great deal of courage to be vulnerable. To be authentic and seen for who you truly are is not for wimps.Less courageous leaders pretend they are strong and will never break. They never acknowledge their weaknesses or vulnerabilities.The possibility of greatness opens up when we are are truly prepared to move through our fears&mdash;in other words, allow ourselves to be vulnerable. Too often, it is much easier to settle for highly functioning mediocrity in our life rather than to risk exposure to criticism and the possibility of failure.Humiliation is what you feel in front of others; shame is what you feel alone&mdash;LaRae QuyAccording to <u> <a href=\"http://brenebrown.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brene Brown </a></u>, the <a href=\"https://spiritualityhealth.com/articles/2012/11/27/bren%C3%A9-brown-how-vulnerability-holds-key-emotional-intimacy#\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  root of shame is fear </u> .</a> &ldquo;The questions we are living by&mdash;what are we supposed to fear, and who is to blame?&mdash;are exhausting for us spiritually, emotionally. Fear consumes an enormous amount of energy in our lives&hellip;we are spending so much time and energy being afraid that we are not fully walking into our power and our gifts.&rdquo;Our culture tells us that in order to be successful, we cannot live an ordinary life. Unless you are grabbing lots of attention and have lots of followers, you are not successful. Just look at the wildly popular &ldquo;Keeping Up With The Kardashians.&rdquo;But in truth, success has become another word for narcissism. No wonder vulnerability is so scary&mdash;it has become synonymous with failure and things to be avoided.SWAT, Navy SEALS, Special Forces, and FBI agents are trained to understand that fear is a healthy gift because courage is the product of our vulnerability, not of our strengths.Here are 4 reasons vulnerability is the road to courage&mdash;and success:<h3> 1. Forces Self-Awareness</h3>Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes―Carl JungFor those who think that self awareness is a touchy-feely approach to leadership and that emotional intelligence is a waste of time, think again. The tough guy blasting his way through obstacles is very popular in movies and books, but it&rsquo;s fantasy.In a <u> 2010 study</u> by Green Peak Partners and Cornell&rsquo;s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, a high self-awareness score was the strongest predictor of overall success.Emotional awareness is a requirement for mental toughness. It doesn&rsquo;t take rocket science to understand that successful leaders who are aware of their weaknesses are in a better position to hire people who will compliment them and make up for those areas in which they are weak.Assuming that is, the leader is willing to admit they have weaknesses&mdash;in other words, acknowledge their vulnerabilities.What we do not accept about ourselves can often be the very thing that derails us, so bringing awareness to this is important for your future success.<h3> 2. Builds Resilience</h3>Vulnerability is the combination of uncertainty, risk, and challenges. Welcome to life! To pretend you are not vulnerable would leave you in a perpetual state of denial and stress.Resilience is our ability to withstand challenges to our established way of life&mdash;to bend without breaking. As such, vulnerability may be considered the soft underbelly of resilience. Our ability to be vulnerable stimulates the brain to find ways to adapt to our constantly changing environment.Allowing a vulnerability to surface creates a disturbance in our environment, and our <u> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3643078/\" target=\"_blank\">  autonomic brain responses are mobilized </a></u> in order to provide stability.When the brain detects a threat to our status quo, it triggers increases in chemicals like cortisol and metabolic hormones. This is a healthy, albeit primitive, stress response that ensures our survival. The ability to adapt to stressors in our environment allows us to bounce back when we hit the unexpected.<h3> 3. Grow&mdash;Or Wither Up And Die</h3>We are so afraid of suffering or feeling pain in any form that we would prefer to live unfulfilled lives rather than experience discomfort.It takes courage to invite pain, suffering, and discomfort into our life. We cling to the old way of doing things because we lack certainty and fear the unknown. Instead of taking a closer look at why we feel so vulnerable, we gun our engines and stay on course.That means you stop learning, stretching, and growing. In essence, you die, although your body may not be buried until decades later.Innovation and creativity demand vulnerability. Every entrepreneurial undertaking is courageous and risky. Experimentation is at the heart of innovation, so instead of feeling powerless by this vulnerability, replace it with the wisdom earned from each of your experiences.Until you realize that innovation and vulnerability are played by the same hand, you will always balk at moving past your comfort zone.<h3> 4. Reins In Your Ego</h3>The small mind is binary&mdash;everything is either good or bad, yes or no. It looks for comparisons and judgments.The great mind synthesizes new information and alternative points of view. To be great, you must allow yourself to be vulnerable.The ego hates this! The ego always wants to be right.

{"original_id":2267,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The 5 Things That Separate Modern Professionals From The Past","link":"the-5-things-that-separate-modern-professionals-from-the-past","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  There is no doubt that financial advisory practices are evolving rapidly into professional practices, with many already fully there. </strong>  There is also no doubt that a number of financial advisers and practices are struggling to evolve, and are firmly rooted in transactional, product-focussed, business models.</p><p> The more you compare the two &ndash; the modern professional financial advisory practice, and the historic product-focussed financial services brokerage business, it seems there are 5 distinct points of difference between the two.  These 5 differences suggest a way forward for those aspirational and career-focussed advisers who have not yet figured out how to make the business model transition.</p><p> <strong>  The modern professional practice is different because: </strong></p><li> It separates product solutions from advice.</li><li> It doesn&rsquo;t link its value proposition to performance of a product or supplier or the markets.</li><li> It leverages knowledge, systems &amp; information</li><li> It focuses on clients and market segments who value the advice component</li><li> It accepts that with the modern consumer there is a slower &amp; longer buying cycle; but it produces higher value clients for the practice <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The separation of advice from product enables the advice component to be assessed on its own merit by customers. </strong>  It solidifies the professional relationship and establishes a clear focus on whose interests are paramount.  Product solutions may well follow the advice component, but they are secondary, and often considered by both parties &ndash; the practitioner and the customer &ndash; as tactics to help achieve the strategic objectives.  It is the strategic and objective advice which is valuable; the tactics of using particular product solutions at different times is a convenience  and a means to an end.</p><p> No advice professional really expects to be able to continually and repeatedly predict market performance or direction with any accuracy. Nor do they expect to be able to ensure that products perform as anticipated all the time.  Therefore it is foolish to create a value proposition in a customers mind that hinges upon market or product performance, which are areas beyond the advisers control or influence.  The value proposition for the modern professional is centred upon the life changes they can help facilitate for clients, and the achievement of client lifestyle goals.</p><p> Historically many advisers built businesses which had strong cashflows generated by repeated transactions, and those transactions relied upon an individual being able to convince people to &ldquo;act now&rdquo;.  The modern practitioner relies upon educating and informing customers so that they make good decisions, and recognise the &ldquo;now&rdquo; moments themselves, because they were predicted as part of achieving the plan. To support the raising of awareness and good decision-making by customers the modern practitioner invests in systems to ensure all customers are being continually engaged and informed, and has a commitment to providing relevant and practical information on an ongoing basis.</p><p> Everyone in society might buy any give thing at any given time.  To the transactionally-focussed advisers, anyone breathing and who has money is a prospect. To the advice professional, not all prospects in the marketplace are potentially good customers.  Whether it is because they are so self assured and capable of achieving their goals themselves, or whether it is because they lack aspiration and will not engage in anything which might change their lives, the fact is there are parts of society that simply place little to no value upon either changing their lives or getting help to do so. The professional has a clear picture of who they best help and who they best work with, and puts their effort into only dealing with those prospective customers.</p><h3> The final point of separation is &ldquo;patience&rdquo;.  </h3><p> <br/> Professionals are patient, and understand that good customers need to develop awareness and confidence, and be assured that the process really is focussed on them and their objectives.  That takes time to achieve; it can&rsquo;t be done at a first meeting one evening.</p><p> I believe there will continue to be a place for the transactional business model for some time to come.  After all, there are a fair proportion of customers out there who have relatively simple needs, or who are convinced that they just need &ldquo;product X&rdquo; right now.  The non-fee charging broker model willing to execute that trade has a place and fulfils a need.  The revenue model underpinning that business structure is under attack from a number of quarters: the product manufacturers, regulators and the consumers themselves.  So while there will continue to be a need and a place for it, one has to assume that margins will get tighter and the business model will become tougher to pursue profitably over time.</p><p> The modern professional who is highly valued by the customer, and who will have a longer, deeper and ultimately more profitable relationship with, will be the one who focusses upon the 5 key things that separate them from the transactional brokers and customers.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 15:09:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 15:09:47.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_04yKV8x.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-5-things-that-separate-modern-professionals-from-the-past/\", \"post_id\": \"5128\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 15:09:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 15:09:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-5-things-that-separate-modern-professionals-from-the-past\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5127\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2313\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-01-at-8.11.51-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"404\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438603200,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2266,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Shifting Focus From Markets to Clients Can Build a More Valuable Financial Planning Practice","link":"shifting-focus-from-markets-to-clients-can-build-a-more-valuable-financial-planning-practice","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  Simon Hoyle </u></p><p> A key element in shifting an advice proposition from being market-centric to being client-centric is to prove to advisers that they can create greater enterprise value in their advice practices by changing, according to Russell Investments&rsquo; managing director of capital markets insights and US private client services, Tim Noonan.</p><p> Noonan says a business model built on aggregating funds under advice has served advisers well in the past. And he says it will continue to serve advisers well in the future, as long as &ldquo;no one ever decumulates, and the market just goes up, and the cyclicality [of market returns] doesn&rsquo;t bully people out of the market&rdquo;.</p><p> Noonan (pictured) says an approach to creating investment solutions based on &ldquo;surplus wealth&rdquo; &ndash; that is, how much over- or under-funded a client is to meet their retirement objectives &ndash; is a subtle change from constructing portfolios based on risk tolerance, but it shifts the nature of the relationship between adviser and client and can change the economics of the advice practice.</p><p> &ldquo;Advisers have to manage their clients&rsquo; money on the basis of their surplus wealth,&rdquo; Noonan says.</p><p> &ldquo;If their client has a lot of surplus wealth, they have lots of investment options. If their client is really close to the bone, they have far fewer options. So appropriate portfolios, the optimal portfolio, the efficient portfolio for the client, is not efficient with respect to a tangent line on some efficient frontier; it&rsquo;s efficient with respect to the balancing point of how much risk does my client have to take, in the time they have, to meet all of their liabilities?&rdquo;</p><p> If advisers can crack this nut, they will have a proposition that is relatively easy to articulate, obviously valuable to clients, which clients will pay for, and which does not generate variable revenue depending on market fluctuations.</p><h3> Determine surplus wealth</h3><p> <br/> Noonan says Russell has developed an online tool to help advisers quickly and efficiently determine a client&rsquo;s surplus wealth. From there they can define a solution for each client.</p><p> &ldquo;Here is the wonderful thing about constructing portfolios that are ratcheted to funded ratios: they are not all different,&rdquo; Noonan says.</p><p> &ldquo;They come in kind of groupings. There&rsquo;s an investment strategy that is appropriate for someone who is extremely overfunded. There&rsquo;s a portfolio strategy that is appropriate for someone who is profoundly under-funded.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s a concept that at its core advisers are already familiar with, because many routinely undertake a similar exercise with clients but group them &ndash; and deploy model portfolios or asset allocations &ndash; based on risk tolerance rather than surplus wealth.</p><p> &ldquo;Bingo,&rdquo; Noonan says. He says all that is required is &ldquo;a very modest refinement of that&rdquo;.</p><p> &ldquo;And in that very modest refinement, what I&rsquo;m going to do is allow you, as the adviser, to move from being a market-centric adviser to being a client-centric adviser,&rdquo; he says.</p><p> &ldquo;Now [advisers] are hugging you. It&rsquo;s like: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted all along! I never meant to pretend like I was a little capital market expert, like I was a portfolio manager. I never wanted to pretend I was in that role &ndash; that&rsquo;s why I outsource that stuff to you guys&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><h3> Greater enterprise value</h3><p> <br/> Noonan says his job is to present evidence to advisers that the adoption of the &ldquo;surplus wealth&rdquo; approach will lead to building greater enterprise value in their advisory firm&rdquo;.</p><p> &ldquo;This sounds so simple and so banal,&rdquo; he says.</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got to prove to you that what I&rsquo;m telling you to do is good for your business, right? The percentage of advisers, even very mature advisers, who actually understand the properties of enterprise value and how you build enterprise in a financial advisory practice is fractional.</p><p> &ldquo;They think they do it by raising assets. They confuse the difference between revenues and profits. And they don&rsquo;t see that retained profits over time is what builds value. They can&rsquo;t see what structurally they need to invest in in their practice, on order to convert more revenue to profit. More scalable service models, for example.</p><p> &ldquo;As you might guess, this enterprise value thing is more than an academic question at the moment because we have a lot of boomer advisers who are thinking about the back nine and if they can&rsquo;t figure out how to transfer this enterprise value, either to a buyer or to a successor, they have essentially spent their life career building something which has become &ndash; I hate to put it this way &ndash; essentially a non-working asset.&rdquo;</p><p> Noonan says the proof of value has to be supported by the tools advisers need to implement a refined way of implementing investment solutions. And the provider of those tools has to demonstrate a willingness to stick around and help advisers through the transition.</p><h3> A very specific windmill</h3><p> <br/> Noonan, who wrapped up a national road show of Australia this week, says his job over the past 10 years has been &ldquo;really tilting at a very specific windmill&rdquo;.</p><p> &ldquo;That is to say to advisers, if you do not have a specific and precise understanding of your clients&rsquo; liabilities &ndash; by which I mean, what they are going to need in the future, their obligations, their promises, whatever language you want to use that conveys to everyman what they are going to consumer in the future &ndash; what is the means? What is the basis of the advice?&rdquo;</p><p> Noonan says there has been &ldquo;a meaningful gap between what advisers are needing, and what they&rsquo;re able to obtain from their traditional vendors and sources in order to provide, basically, higher-quality advice&rdquo;, Noonan says.</p><p> &ldquo;By higher quality, that&rsquo;s partly in regard to more personalised advice and the demands that the end investors have for solutions that are more sensitive to their specific outcomes, and less inherently product orientated.&rdquo;</p><p> Noonan agrees that the gap reflects a difference in opinion between what advisers believe advisers do, and what some licensees believe advisers do.</p><p> &ldquo;That difference became acute and accentuated with the convergence of two things,&rdquo; Noonan says.</p><p> &ldquo;[One was] the depth and severity of the global financial crisis and how long and lacklustre the recovery was. This cemented not just the belief but the fact in many clients&rsquo; minds that what they had gone though in the GFC was a legitimately threatening event to their personal financial security.</p><p> &ldquo;And then secondly you have to consider the demographic moment it occurred: at a time when you were reaching this sort of tipping point of the boomers moving into retirement. So now you have this accelerated number of investors in the advisers&rsquo; client population who are moving en mass acutely to the same recognition: we need something more; we need something different; we need something that is more specifically reassuring to me, the client, that my outcomes are a) understood, and b) ratcheted to the correct portfolio solutions.&rdquo;</p><p> Noonan says this changing backdrop means the industry has faced an uphill task to keep up.</p><p> &ldquo;The industry has been primarily tooled to an accumulation mentality,&rdquo; Noonan says.</p><p> &ldquo;A lot of the accoutrements of the advisory business &ndash; the technical capability housed on typical adviser platforms &ndash; are really primarily orientated, still, towards accumulation and attitudes towards risk and so forth.&rdquo;</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 15:00:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 15:00:41.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_wrcXRCt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/shifting-focus-from-markets-to-clients-can-build-a-more-valuable-financial-planning-practice/\", \"post_id\": \"5126\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 15:00:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 15:00:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"shifting-focus-from-markets-to-clients-can-build-a-more-valuable-financial-planning-practice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5125\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2312\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438403032096-a9aa9da06f97-copy-2.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"380\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438598700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Huy writes a regular blog at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.disruptivefinance.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Disruptive Finance  </a> </u> , as well as being a Managing Director for Macro Structuring at Citi.  He posted something in the last week that I felt was worth re-posting as a guest blog.  </p><p> ________________ <br/> <br/> Traditional finance providers such as banks or insurance companies are being challenged by new players such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lendingclub.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lending Club  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.transferwise.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Transferwise  </a> </u> . These startups want to disintermediate the incumbents and revolutionize the financial world.</p><p> But what is the biggest difference betwen a bank or insurer and a Fintech startup? <br/> - Legacy systems vs. lean IT? Yes.  <br/> - Innovation culture? Of course.  <br/> - Faster development cycle? Certainly.</p><p> All these elements are valid, but I think that finance in 2025 will be fundamentally different because of a single reason:  <strong>  DATA  . </strong></p><p> Of course, big data is a buzzword that is being used everywhere, but that's not what I mean. What I have in mind is: BUSINESS MODELS BASED ON DATA MONETIZATION.</p><h3> What is the business model of a bank?</h3><p> <br/> To understand this important concept, let's go back to the fundamentals of traditional finance.The revenue model of a bank or insurer is primarily made of :</p><p> 1) Interest Income: if a bank manages to lend money at 2% and borrows at 1%, then it makes 1% of income. In practice, it's much more complex than that and a good Asset Liability Management ensures that this equation stays true. <br/> <br/> 2) Fees: a bank would charge for certain transactions (e.g. a currency transfer) or to sell certain products (e.g. distribute insurance contracts). This generates revenues from fees. <br/> <br/> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-how-a-bank-makes-money-2011-5?IR=T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   document from Deutsche Bank  </a> </u>  shows that Interest Income represents 65% of revenues and Fees represent 35% for a typical bank. <br/> <br/> We can see that data is not important in that business model. Data can be used to improve the business - for example in insurance underwriting - but it is not a source of revenues for traditional finance.</p><h3> What is the business model of Google?</h3><p> <br/> Now, let's take Google. How does Google make money? 95% of its revenues are from advertising. But of course, advertising is just the medium, the business of Google is Data Monetization. Google exploits the data it collects, processes and sells that information in the form of targeted ads. The exploitation of data generates the revenues, without any needs for fees or interest income. <br/> <br/> Comparing the revenue models of a bank and of Google, we can see that the sources of revenue are totally different. This can be summarised in a single chart as below.</p><h3> Finance does not monetize its wealth of data</h3><p> <br/> <br/> <br/> Traditional finance is based on the century-old model of making money from interest and fees. But technology has allowed data-led business to make money from the information itself - without the need to charge for fees. Today, these two worlds are separate : finance is still based on interest income and fees and does not monetize information about clients' behaviours. <br/> <br/> But if a company like Google can generate $66bn of revenues from browsing information alone, imagine the kind of business that will be built based one real-time financial information about clients. Instead of Google trying to guess your spending power, a financial company actually knows exactly how much you have spent, where you spent it, what you like spending on, and how much you can spend.</p><h3> Will data monetization be the game changer in finance?</h3><p> <br/> If you think that the business model of Google cannot apply to finance, then have a look at  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/credit-karma\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Credit Karma that just raised $175m  </a> </u>  which tries to do just that...</p><p> This is in my opinion the major revolution that will happen in finance over the next 10 years, where financial providers will realise that monetization of financial data is a business in itself. And that is the biggest threat of Fintech for traditional finance. </p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 14:44:25.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 14:44:25.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_MN1EAgv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-one-chart-you-need-to-understand-fintech/\", \"post_id\": \"5124\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 14:44:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 14:44:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-one-chart-you-need-to-understand-fintech\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5123\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2311\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-01-at-7.53.18-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"573\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438617600,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

Data is important for all facets of HR, but extremely important for recruiters and talent acquisition specialists. With  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/10/07/big-data-in-human-resources-a-world-of-haves-and-have-nots/\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Deloitte  </u>    </a> reporting that 56% of HR is reporting at a &ldquo;Reactive-Operational&rdquo; level, it would stand to reason that most of HR practitioners are operating blindly day-to-day with no lens for what works or doesn&rsquo;t work. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the reality of how this approach seldom works with CEOs, CFOs or any other executive leadership; but if we must start somewhere to shift our mindsets about data &ndash; let it start with recruitment.</p><h3> Do your recruiters know where candidates are dropping off in application process?</h3><p> <br/> If the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, you have an opportunity for data. Not only should they be running reports to see where candidates are dropping off in the application process to identify potential hurdles or bottlenecks &ndash; they should be monitoring things like referral sources to understand which sources are actually allowing them to find and attract the candidates they need. In fact, if you a recruiter working for a federal contractor it is imperative that you look at referral sources since the OFCCP is now scrutinizing contractors who are &ldquo;spraying and praying&rdquo; job openings without evaluation of ROI.</p><h3> Forget &ldquo;Time-to-Fill&rdquo;!</h3><p> <br/> If there is one metric recruiters hate it is &ldquo;time-to-fill&rdquo;.  It is the sole metric in many organizations by which a recruiter is deemed effective or ineffective. What does &ldquo;time-to-fill&rdquo; tell us:</p><li> The time between someone inputting the requisition into your ATS to the date the recruiter filled the requisition with a person.</li><li> It took the recruiter some increment of time to fill a position.</li><li> The time it took the recruiter to fill the position under the pressure of deadlines, coupled with the time needed to find said rockstar, multiplied by the many instances where the hiring manager neglected to respond to inquiries for reviews, interviews etc. <br/>  </li><p> In effect, &ldquo;time-to-fill&rdquo; is a flawed metric, but still revered by Talent Acquisition Managers everywhere because it is delivered by every ATS known to man and that&rsquo;s what they have always measured recruiters&rsquo; effectiveness by. I say: &ldquo;forget time-to-fill&rdquo; and start having your recruitment teams look at referral source to hire metrics that allow you to look at the referral sources driving your hires. Look at time-to-start metrics to evaluate any bottlenecks in the hiring process preventing new hires from getting vetted and acclimated quicker. Moreover, use data to take a deeper look at trends pre and post-hire to ensure that hiring process and talent management lifecycle for the organization aligns with you intention.</p><p> Like everything else in HR, it is clear we have to evolve and do some tweaking to how we operate. It has always been my belief that no other facet of HR needs to exist if we can&rsquo;t first get candidates through the door and ultimately retain them. <strong>  No employees means, no HR. </strong> This is why it is so crucial that organizations train and empower their recruitment teams to be proactive with reporting and data analysis. Act Two for recruitment teams is being able to illustrate the hiring story with data that allows you to effectively partner with the rest of the organization to ensure success.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 14:39:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 14:39:23.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_fnM1Xqz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-your-recruiters-data-driven/\", \"post_id\": \"5122\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 14:39:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 14:39:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-your-recruiters-data-driven\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5121\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2310\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1438262267532-2db13fcceca2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"594\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438606800,"author_id":212,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2262,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Certificate of Authenticity: Conceptual Art","link":"the-certificate-of-authenticity-conceptual-art","source_link":null,"content":"<p>  Written by: Fran Zeman |  <a href=\"http://www.appraisalresources.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Appraisal Resource Associates, Inc.  </u> </a></p><p> Appraisers are often called upon to appraise prints and other works of art for which a &ldquo;certificate of authenticity&rdquo; has been issued. Depending on the issuer of the certificate and claims it makes, this piece of paper can be valuable or valueless. The topic to be addressed here concerns what a valid Certificate of Authenticity means to the value of Conceptual art.</p><h3> For Conceptual art, it is the artist&rsquo;s idea or concept that constitutes originality.</h3><p> <br/> Because Conceptual art works are accompanied by a plan/template and/or may be made of natural materials, or commercially available/industrial materials anyone can buy, in theory, anyone with a set of these plans/templates can create/recreate the art. Just two examples of artists whose work fits this profile are Sol LeWitt (Wall Drawings) and Dan Flavin (fluorescent light sculptures). Once artists began issuing certificates of authenticity documenting their work in enough specific detail and registered/recorded the issuance of the certificate in their records/archives, this document became the most important factor related to the art itself. In fact, without it, the artwork is not marketable or may not even be insurable. <br/> <br/> Say you purchased a Conceptual artwork by any number of artists who have since died, you have owned the property for 25 years and you find that the certificate is missing. Even with perfect records and a copy of the original certificate signed by the artist, the chances of you being issued a replacement of the original are next to none.  No matter that the artist&rsquo;s foundation has the same records &ndash; they will generally refuse to re-issue a certificate on the chance that the original will surface, making it possible for a second &ldquo;authorized&rdquo; work to be produced. <br/> <br/> <strong>  When you purchase a Conceptual work of art, make sure to protect the paperwork, especially anything that is &ldquo;blueprint-like&rdquo; in terms of design and construction. </strong> While you have the right to install, de-install and reinstall, as long as you follow the artist&rsquo;s concept and instructions, the work of art is as original as it was at concept. Put the certificates in a fireproof place and, if you consign your art for sale, make certain the consignee agrees to indemnify you if the accompanying certificate is lost. In this case, value is in the paper on which the certificate is printed.  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-01 14:23:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-01 14:23:47.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_oCSzAy2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-certificate-of-authenticity-conceptual-art/\", \"post_id\": \"5118\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-01 14:23:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-01 14:23:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-certificate-of-authenticity-conceptual-art\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5117\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2308\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-01-at-7.25.57-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"488\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438628400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2261,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Find Your Purpose and Passion in Life","link":"how-to-find-your-purpose-and-passion-in-life","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If I held up a fork and asked you, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the purpose of this?&rdquo; you would probably say &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a utensil we use to feed ourselves.&rdquo; If I showed you a chair and asked, &ldquo;what is the purpose of this object?&rdquo; you would say, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a thing we sit on.&rdquo; Why is it that we know the purpose of the things we use but are unable to explain the purpose for which they have been uniquely designed and created. The good news is that you can discover how to find your purpose and passion in life by seeking to serve and relieve the pain of others.</p><p> When the elimination of the pain of others becomes our passion, our purpose becomes clear. Each one of us has been created to serve. The question is: what purpose does our life serve in making this world a better place? What purpose do you serve in leading our family? How are we of serve to our community? How does our business identify the pain of others and then design products and services to lessen that pain? When we get passionate about eliminating the pain of poverty, disease and injustice we are certain to discover our life purpose.</p><h3> Understanding Why Were Created</h3><p> <br/> Think about it for a moment. Who determines the purpose of any object? Is it the user, or is it the inventor? Of course it is the inventor that determines purpose; it is the user that determines how the invention will be put to use. Just the same, our inventor (or Creator) determined our purpose when we were created in our mother&rsquo;s womb. How we use our life (or use up our time) here on earth is our call. The value we place on ourselves and our time is up to us. It&rsquo;s called choice. We can choose many things in life, but we cannot choose our purpose. We cannot choose our purpose; we can only <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/3-things-to-help-you-clearly-identify-your-life-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   understand our purpose </a> .</p><p> If you didn&rsquo;t know the purpose for a tool in your toolbox or a utensil in your kitchen you&rsquo;d probably throw it out. Not knowing the purpose of an object makes that object of little value to you. It&rsquo;s as if that object was worthless. Many times valuable objects are discarded simply because their purpose is not known to the owner. That&rsquo;s why many lives are thrown away. The people who own them don&rsquo;t know their purpose.</p><h3> The Key is Exposure</h3><p> <br/> The power of purpose is the strongest force that can ever be at work within us. Most times the thing holding us back is exposure. We live safe and comfortable lives. We maybe take a volunteer vacation and get exposed to extreme poverty for a week or so. For some the impact will be life-changing. For some the sight of pain and poverty will disappear with time. Like the memory of a bad dream, it didn&rsquo;t come to stay, it came to pass.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll never forget my first visit to a hospital in Romania and the impact it had on me. One little five-year-old boy in particular. His mother had dropped him off the day before I visited the hospital for kids with Aids in Constanta,  abandoning him like so many other parents had done. As my friend Keith Gonyou, who had accompanied me on this particular trip, picked him up from his crib, this little guy threw his arms around Keith&rsquo;s neck, and began babbling in Romanian and refusing to let go.</p><p> I turned to our translator to get the English version of what the boy was saying. Our translator responded, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s saying God has sent us to take him home.&rdquo; How do you tell a five-year-old he can&rsquo;t go home? Not now. Not ever. I watched as tears filled Keith&rsquo;s eyes and he turned to me and said, &ldquo;Ben, get me out of here. I can&rsquo;t handle this.&rdquo; The pain caused by the choices made by an evil leader was unbearable to watch. But making a vow to help  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/how-to-become-a-person-of-compassion/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  relieve that pain </a>  was key to me finding my life purpose.</p><h3> Why Are You Still Here?</h3><p> <br/> What about you? Are you clear about your life purpose? Is there a pain that exists in the world that were specially designed to help alleviate? Will you say YES! for this purpose I was born?</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=When+the+pain+of+others+becomes+our+passion%2C+our+purpose+becomes+clear.+-+Ben+Kubassek&amp;via=benkubassek&amp;related=benkubassek&amp;url=http://www.kubassek.com/how-to-find-your-purpose-and-passion-in-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   When the pain of others becomes our passion, our purpose becomes clear. &ndash; Ben Kubassek  </a> </u></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-31 20:53:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-31 20:53:58.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_YJ2F0lr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-find-your-purpose-and-passion-in-life/\", \"post_id\": \"5116\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-31 20:53:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-31 20:53:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-find-your-purpose-and-passion-in-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5115\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2307\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438255291836-51c907ba9361-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"402\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438430400,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2260,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are Robots The Future Of Grapevine Pruning?","link":"are-robots-the-future-of-grapevine-pruning","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Ann-Marie Jeffries | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/growingproduce\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Growing Produce  </u> </a></p><p> A year from now, robots could be pruning your vines.</p><p> In 2012, Purdue University received $6 million in grant funding to develop robotic pruning for grapes and apples. Now, developers are putting the finishing touches on a robotic pruner that could be available by next year, according to Purdue Associate Professor of Horticulture Peter Hirst.</p><p> While the project focused on both apple trees and grapevines, the work is farther along with grapevines, Hirst says.</p><p> &ldquo;Grapevine is a more simplified canopy structure, so it&rsquo;s quite easy to work with &mdash; it&rsquo;s more of a two-dimensional structure, whereas apple trees are a three-dimensional structure,&rdquo; he explains.</p><p> Purdue&rsquo;s commercial partner for the project is a San Diego-based company called Vision Robotics Corp. Hirst says the company has created a prototype robotic harvesting machine that works well, but the focus now is on improving the speed and precision.</p><h3> How It Works</h3><p> <br/> The machine has a series of cameras that take photos of dormant grapevines. It then builds a three-dimensional image of the vine based on the photos and applies various pruning rules. Based on those rules and the images, it decides where the pruning cuts should be made. It has two robotic arms, each one with a pruner on the end of it &mdash; one on each side of the vine.

{"original_id":2258,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Beliefs That May Be Stealing Your Happiness","link":"5-beliefs-that-may-be-stealing-your-happiness","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When we ponder the meaning of life, or the purpose of our own life, it often boils down to how we measure up in the happiness department.</p><p> Books have been written, movies have been made, and entire industries have been constructed in order to help people achieve the goal of happiness.  Even with these efforts, though, it still remains rather elusive for many people.</p><p> The following 5 beliefs may explain why you have trouble maintaining happiness.</p><h3> 1. Money determines my happiness</h3><p> <br/> Does your happiness fluctuate with your bank account balance, 401k, or the stock market? For many, how much money we have directly correlates with our ability to be happy. But often that amount is relative and arbitrary. Ask someone who has $1 thousand and they will tell you if they had $2 thousand they would feel happy. Ask someone who has $250 thousand and they may tell you the number is $500 thousand. Some millionaires I know, feel quite vulnerable if their net worth dips below $50 million! When you link money to happiness, you will find that your need for more becomes insatiable.</p><h3> 2. The success or failure of others influences my happiness</h3><p> <br/> To the primitive part of our brain, other people pose a threat to us; in essence, they represent potential competitors. If one of those competitors out does us&mdash;in essence one-ups us, it can impact our happiness. And, if that person or someone else whom we view as more powerful than us slips and falls, there may be a slight feeling of satisfaction&mdash;a twinge of happiness. Most tabloid magazines are particularly good at highlighting the rise and fall of those who are wealthier, prettier, or smarter than us. And for many this permits a transient sense of happiness. And the reverse can be true.</p><h3> 3. I will be happy only if someone else is happy</h3><p> <br/> This is the trap many parents fall into. As parents don&rsquo;t we wish just that for our children? &ldquo;All I want for my children is for them to be happy,&rdquo; and if they are not, it often impacts the ability for a parent to be happy.  Others may require a boyfriend or wife to be content. Although it may seem as though this type of happiness is a good thing or even moral, truth be told co-dependent happiness is fragile and often leads to self-sacrifice, which in my experience can lead to self-sabotage.</p><h3> 4. Certain conditions determine my happiness</h3><p> <br/> Often we have preconditions for happiness. When certain event benchmarks are met, we are certain happiness will ensue. Whether it is our team winning, or achieving a particular rank in a club, or moving into our dream house, or landing our dream job, or finding our soul mate. Happiness is rarely cause and effect and when viewed that way, it is usually transient, as when one requirement is met it usually paves the way for another requirement, and so on.</p><h3> 5. Things make me happy</h3><p> <br/> This is not a call for you to judge yourself as superficial or to question the happiness you may feel when receiving a gift. However, when happiness greatly depends on the number or size of material possessions it is a precarious one. Just as when our happiness relies on particular events, at some point we will need more and more things to make us happy, as we get tired with the ones we have.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 19:08:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 19:08:48.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_LbJ5xyz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-beliefs-that-may-be-stealing-your-happiness/\", \"post_id\": \"5108\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 19:08:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 19:08:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-beliefs-that-may-be-stealing-your-happiness\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5107\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2302\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438232992991-995b7058bbb3-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"776\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438358400,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2257,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When is Your Investment Monitoring Good Enough?","link":"when-is-your-investment-monitoring-good-enough","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As you&rsquo;re probably judged in part on the return on investment of your work, why should your plans investment monitoring be any different? While pension law says that you will be judged on your investment process, is it not prudent to include performance output as part of the process? The Nirvana is to have first quartile fees and first quartile performance. Excessive fees decrease performance. Are you paying too much or are your employees paying too much? Let&rsquo;s start with understanding where your employees&rsquo; investment results stand.</p><h3> Investment monitoring and performance</h3><p> <br/> Examining where your performance stands requires getting third party information that compares your plan to the universe. We use a couple of comparison sources to see where your plan stands. If not us, I recommend that you work with a fiduciary provider that uses third-party research to compare your plan against.</p><p> The Center for Fiduciary Studies recommends establishing a plan benchmark. For example, you might choose a mixture that is based on 50% S &amp;P 500 index and 50% Aggregate Bond Index.</p><p> If you are using a target date strategy for your qualified default investment alternative I recommend pick a benchmark that most closely represents the current asset allocation of your qualified default investment alternatives. Working with one of my private wealth clients on her retirement planning, we found that combining 80% S&amp;P 500 and 20% bond index tracking investments had outperformed by a significant measure the recommended target date option for her age group. Of course, she opted out of the qualified default investment alternative.</p><h3> Investment monitoring and plan fees</h3><p> <br/> Many employees are still under the impression that they pay nothing for their plan. Employers and employees often fail to realize the costs they bear, typically embedded inside of the investments. Think of the costs being grossed up in order to cover the costs. Both employer and employee received disclosures of the fees starting a couple of years ago. However I have yet to meet a plan sponsor or employee that actually knows that these disclosures actually happened.</p><p> Have you examined your record keeper&rsquo;s disclosure of plan fees? I&rsquo;ve talked with many plan decision-makers that either did not know about this regulation, knew where to find the information or third have been able to find the time to do a comparison themselves. Suffice it to say that most companies seem to be focused on direct cost to them rather than indirect costs. This seems to be totally rational. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not what the law expects that you will do. The Department of Labor understanding how difficult it was to try to track down this information as a plan decision maker thought to have a fee disclosure sent to you in plain English. However that&rsquo;s had many challenges in implementation. If you have not done so I recommend that you hire a fiduciary adviser at least on a contract basis to help you understand your fees. One of my clients found that their fees were embedded into a report that she would not have noticed except for our review meeting where I uncovered that issue for her. She has since found a new Record-keeper with a more transparent model. In another case, it appeared to the decision-makers that they were paying direct costs of about $3000. Unfortunately there was about $100,000 worth of indirect expenses being charged to the plan that was reducing the individual participant&rsquo;s balances. In their case this was a huge cause of the bottom half investment returns experienced by their employees.</p><h3> Investment monitoring and education</h3><p> <br/> If your performance is poor, your fees are reasonable and have top half fund scores then investment literacy is the likely culprit. To address this you have a couple of tools for your toolbox. One is the use of a qualified default investment alternative, the employee investment decision safe harbor and employee advice. The use of a qualified default investment alternative requires proper selection and monitoring. The investment decision safe harbor often referred to as 404 (c) requires annually completing a list of actions to qualify. Advice in this context means one-on-one advice from a fiduciary adviser.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the next step</h3><li> Find out if your existing service providers are working in a fiduciary capacity. If not skip to 4.</li><li> Ask them to assess how your investment performance compares to others.</li><li> Have them analyze how your fees compare to plans of similar size.</li><li> Find a fiduciary retirement plan adviser to do an independent analysis using independent research. You could choose to have this paid out of plan assets or separately by the company. Remember that you don&rsquo;t have to have the lowest fees but need to be able to show that your employees are getting a good deal for the fees they pay. That being said if your plan has poor performance and has high fees you&rsquo;ve made things worse by charging the analysis to the plan. Many fiduciary advisors include this plan analysis as part of their services to the plan. <br/>  </li><p> You can contact us to get you started immediately.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 18:42:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 18:42:09.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_09Mc7Rl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-is-your-investment-monitoring-good-enough/\", \"post_id\": \"5106\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 18:42:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 18:42:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-is-your-investment-monitoring-good-enough\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5105\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2301\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438211891462-006dc8998ef1-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"658\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438354800,"author_id":207,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2256,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Hillary vs. Trump: Who's Doing Twitter Better?","link":"hillary-vs-trump-whos-doing-twitter-better","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This article orginally appeared in <u>  SocialQuant </u> . </p><p> I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s no need to introduce today&rsquo;s featured opponents: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but just in case, both are running for President in the upcoming 2016 elections. Miss Clinton proudly wears blue in the Democratic Party, while Trump trumpets the Republican Party, even though some aren&rsquo;t sure he is.</p><p> Suffice it to say, these two are opposites.</p><p> But before we jump into this article, let&rsquo;s make it clear that we aren&rsquo;t here to discuss politics or get into the nitty gritty of anything besides how their Twitter accounts are being managed. What&rsquo;s working? What&rsquo;s not?</p><p> As a social media professional who&rsquo;s been in the game since 2009 and worked with many different industries, take my word when I say, there probably isn&rsquo;t a harder industry to manage than politicians. So all my feedback and comparison isn&rsquo;t a reflection on the people gutsy enough to manage them, but more so on strategy in general.</p><p> With these Twitter accounts &ndash; the goal is clear &ndash; they want to win the election! But the accounts also serve as branding venues for the candidates, which enables them to share more about who they are, connect with voters, promote their events, and get involved in conversations that mention them (the good ones).</p><p> So, ladies first!</p><h3> <br/>  </h3><h3> Hillary Clinton</h3><p> <br/> Followers: 3.82M</p><p> Following: 38</p><h3> Cover and profile photos:</h3><p> <br/> Both cover and profile photos are well chosen, they showcase the voters and emphasize her humanness. The cover depicts a nice size crowd of folks who came out to hear her speak at an event. And the profile picture shows active movement with her being engaged with the attendees.</p><p> Humanizing a politician is tough, especially in today&rsquo;s environment, but the profile photo does a great job at utilizing a photo capturing her in a natural state. She isn&rsquo;t posed (as so many political pictures often are) or too stiff looking &ndash; as in a professional photo. Either would be a bad move since the focus is to make her more approachable.</p><p> Finally, the cover and profile match &ndash; something that as a designer I&rsquo;m extra picky about, but because this is a professional account and its purpose is a serious one, this aids in showing she means business.</p><h3> Bio:</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Hillary&rsquo;s bio. It incorporates all the things a Twitter bio should &ndash; no matter how professional the account. First, it shares who she is as a women (wife, mom, grandma), then what she stands for (women + kids advocate), her job history (Senator, SecState), humor (BIG plus for hair icon, pantsuit aficionado), and her intention (2016 presidential candidate).</p><p> Finally, it lets followers know immediately that she&rsquo;s not trying to pretend these tweets are from her, but shares what those tweets look like ( signed -H).</p><p> With this bio, Hillary became an everyday woman. Women will identify with her roles in life, people will appreciate knowing who she is (in case they&rsquo;ve been living under a rock), and everyone will chuckle at the &ldquo;hair icon, pantsuit aficionado&rdquo; references.</p><p> Twitter feed:</p><p> <br/> The deal with a brand as big and well known as Hillary Clinton is that the typical rules don&rsquo;t apply. There&rsquo;s no reason to follow the 80/20 rule, post at optimal times (if you believe that even exists on Twitter) or be sure to share a variety of valuable content for the followers &ndash; she can basically do whatever she wants&hellip;</p><p> But is that really true? Definitely not.</p><p> Most politicians have a game plan and an intention. They don&rsquo;t utilize social media for anything besides pushing their endeavors and engaging with people. Humanizing them is of upmost importance, but that has to be done carefully and purposefully &ndash; too much of anything could pull a candidate one way or another.</p><h3> What stands out:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. She&rsquo;s in it for the people.</h3><p> <br/> The majority of her tweets are about other people or ways to helps others. Things like sharing a playlist of songs dedicated to champions after the women&rsquo;s USA soccer team won, videos with youngsters asking them what they want in a President or allowing them to ask her questions, or sharing the tweets of her fans &ndash; it&rsquo;s definitely not a typical famous account. Meaning, it&rsquo;s not all about her &ndash; it&rsquo;s about the people.</p><br /><h3> 2. She&rsquo;s positive.</h3><p> <br/> Scrolling through her tweets, there isn&rsquo;t anything negative I came across. The overall vibe was positive, involved, and caring. VERY human for a politician.</p><h3> 3. There&rsquo;s little to no back biting.</h3><p> <br/> She doesn&rsquo;t use this account to give out left hooks to her opponents. The account doesn&rsquo;t share tweets that bash opponents or even enter that conversation at all. She sticks to her turf.</p><h3> 4. LOTS of pictures.</h3><p> <br/> A short scan down the Timeline and you&rsquo;ll see plenty of pics that are eye-catching, fun and even, humorous!!</p><br /><h3> 5. Little to no direct promotions</h3><p> <br/> One of the things I preach about in social media marketing is the danger of self-promotion, but the managers have done an excellent job with Hillary&rsquo;s account. Instead of sharing direct promotions, they go the soft route, but don&rsquo;t shy away from their agenda. It&rsquo;s done in a tasteful way. There is nothing pushy or obnoxious about the promotions.</p><br /><h3> 6. She&rsquo;s relevant.</h3><p> <br/> Hillary&rsquo;s Twitter account addresses major social topic being discussed these days: equality, women&rsquo;s issues, and immigration. She isn&rsquo;t shy about showing her support for these communities and has teamed up with well known folks to share the message, which will endear her to the younger audience.</p><br /><br /><br /><h3> Issues:</h3><p> <br/> The only &ldquo;issue&rdquo; I could see with how this account is being managed is the small amount of people it&rsquo;s following, but that&rsquo;s quite normal for accounts that are so famous.</p><p> Overall, I&rsquo;m very impressed with Hillary&rsquo;s account in how they&rsquo;ve managed to humanize it, keep direct promotions classy, incorporate humor, utilize visual content (videos and photos), post consistently, share content for followers, and remain positive.</p><p> My only question is: Is the account too squeaky clean? While it does a great job showing her as a candidate and following political protocol with its social media practices &ndash; does that harm or hurt her image?</p><p> Only you can be the judge.</p><br /><h3> Donald Trump</h3><p> <br/> Followers: 3.12M</p><p> Following: 46</p><h3> Cover and profile photos:</h3><p> <br/> Trump&rsquo;s cover photo is nice and large &ndash; very simple and straightforward with his Presidential message. But unless you know he&rsquo;s running for President, you might not be sure what the message really means. It simply displays his campaign motto, but nothing about the election, i.e. 2016 etc.</p><p> The profile picture is serious and intent &ndash; he looks like someone you&rsquo;d expect to be intense and to the point &ndash; very Donald Trump.</p><p> His Twitter account has been around since 2009 unlike Hillary&rsquo;s who was created in 2013 (probably for the purpose of campaigning), so his account hasn&rsquo;t always been managed with the intention of running for political office.</p><p> But the objective is well displayed &ndash; Trump simply wants to make sure people know who he is and that it&rsquo;s him &ndash; there&rsquo;s no discussion about who owns the account.</p><p> The unfortunate aspect of these photos are that they&rsquo;re stiff and professional &ndash; not good traits for someone who wants to connect with the general public, yet they stay true to the Trump brand. And let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; he doesn&rsquo;t really care about you feeling all warm and fuzzy about him.</p><h3> Bio:</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no playing around with the bio &ndash; he&rsquo;s expecting you to know who he is without any elaboration &ndash; it&rsquo;s simply the official Twitter profile for him, and that&rsquo;s that.</p><p> However, it does include links to his YouTube and Facebook accounts, which is a smart move to promote his other social accounts. But they should delete the additional website link now that Twitter gives us a separate option for it.</p><h3> Twitter feed:</h3><p> <br/> The only strategy utilized on Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed is the &ldquo;no strategy&rdquo; strategy.</p><p> And what&rsquo;s most interesting is that he&rsquo;s actually the one doing the tweeting! For anyone who frequents Twitter, this probably isn&rsquo;t big news as Trump has been known to make a few headline statements on Twitter.</p><p> But when it comes to running in the presidential election, that typically means a whole new strategy is put in place.</p><p> Not Trump!</p><p> Since he&rsquo;s doing a major chunk of the tweeting &ndash; the content is brash and VERY straightforward. We would never see this type of tweeting if a social media professional was managing it because it would do serious to the brand.</p><p> Yet for those who know, it&rsquo;s very Donald Trump and very brand relevant.</p><h3> What stands out:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. He&rsquo;s authentic.</h3><p> <br/> Whether you like Trump or not, it&rsquo;s authentic and real. Few people, especially those with a lot of influence would be so straightforward on social media, but Trump has ZERO issues with it.</p><p> In addition, there&rsquo;s no scheduled tweets &ndash; everything is live and in real time. What you see is definitely what you get.</p><br /><h3> 2. He&rsquo;s very active.</h3><p> <br/> While the tweeting frequency is all over the board, it&rsquo;s a very active account.</p><p> Trump is obviously tracking what other folks on Twitter are saying about him, sharing those tweets (in an old-fashioned, but still relevant way), and including his two cents where he can. He&rsquo;s super engaged and feels empowered in the Twitter culture.</p><p> Again, most folks in his position wouldn&rsquo;t share so much from others, but most of his tweets are just that.</p><h3> 3. He&rsquo;s NOT frilly.</h3><p> <br/> Scrolling back weeks on Trump&rsquo;s feed, one thing is definitely apparent &ndash; there are ZERO frills.</p><p> He&rsquo;s not interested in entertaining the public nor acquiescing to what the norms of Twitter are, he&rsquo;s utilizing it for his benefit 100% and it&rsquo;s raw.</p><p> There&rsquo;s minimal pictures, no funny quotes, no GIFs or anything fancy &ndash; it&rsquo;s just like who we imagine Trump to be &ndash; direct and without nonsense, whether you like it or not.</p><h3> 4. He&rsquo;s appreciative.</h3><p> <br/> A lot of the interaction taking place with folks who love him is simply to say, thank you. And while that may seem simple, it goes a long way for the folks who took the time to tweet at him in the first place. In reading through his feed, I felt like if I wanted to tweet at Trump &ndash; HE might actually respond &ndash; not some paid person, and that&rsquo;s pretty cool!</p><br /><h3> 5. He&rsquo;s straightforward.</h3><p> <br/> While I&rsquo;ve mentioned this a few times now &ndash; being straightforward is under-appreciated in social media, especially by politicians. There&rsquo;s no need to wonder if he&rsquo;s got a hidden agenda with his tweets because it&rsquo;s so honest it hurts. But hey &ndash; his Twitter feed does an excellent job of letting us know where he stands and what he&rsquo;s about. Period</p><br /><h3> Issues:</h3><p> <br/> None. The Trump account sticks tried and true to Trump&rsquo;s brand.</p><h3> The Standoff</h3><p> <br/> Without getting into politics, this is a tough one.</p><p> These are political accounts, one managed by a social media manager and the other run by the candidate himself, so it&rsquo;s difficult to compare them because they&rsquo;re literally night and day in differences.</p><p> Hillary&rsquo;s account is perfectly perfect. It follows a social media strategy to the letter, shares lots of engaging content (photos, videos, GIFs), stays positive, tweets consistently, and makes great use of the profile and cover photo to promote her message of helping people.</p><p> Trump&rsquo;s account is straight-laced, no frills, nothing fancy or promotional &ndash; he&rsquo;s direct, brash, and has zero problem voicing his opinion about anything and everything. He interacts often, shares tweets from both sides of the argument, shares articles that mention him, and tweets like he speaks.</p><p> Quite frankly, these two politicians are utilizing their accounts exactly like their brands should suggest. Hillary is rumored to be terrible at campaigning, so she&rsquo;s hired a full staff to assist in her image development and online branding. And Trump doesn&rsquo;t care what anyone thinks and isn&rsquo;t concerned about being politically correct.</p><p> It comes down to personal preference! Which candidate would YOU prefer to interact with online??</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 18:26:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 18:26:55.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Zhfr2eQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/hillary-vs-trump-whos-doing-twitter-better/\", \"post_id\": \"5104\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 18:26:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 18:26:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"hillary-vs-trump-whos-doing-twitter-better\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5103\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2300\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-getty-640x480.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"633\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438362000,"author_id":8,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2255,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do You Need Life Insurance When You Retire?","link":"do-you-need-life-insurance-when-you-retire","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Raymond Caucco | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pennmutual\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Penn Mutual  </u> </a></p><p> The traditional thinking about life insurance is that you only need life insurance when you have an income to protect, when you have a mortgage, or when you have kids to support. Once you hit 65 and retire, says the myth, you don&rsquo;t need life insurance. That is not true. There are many good reasons for having life insurance after 65, though it is true that it isn&rsquo;t right for everyone.</p><p> <strong>  If you have an existing permanent life insurance policy </strong> , for example, you may be able to tap into accumulated cash value as a form of retirement income. You can incorporate the funds inside your permanent life insurance policy to complement other forms of retirement income such as Social Security, 401(k) plans, and IRAs.</p><p> There also comes a point where people become concerned about outliving their retirement savings. Drawing on the cash value of a permanent life insurance policy enables people to use other resources to guarantee lifetime income, such as a longevity annuity or a guaranteed living benefit.</p><p> <strong>  What if you don&rsquo;t have an existing life insurance policy when you retire? </strong>  Maybe you bought into the idea that you should only buy term life insurance and invest the difference. Maybe you did invest it, or maybe you spent it. No matter, there are reasons that permanent life insurance might be a good idea for you after retirement. One in particular is to transfer wealth from one generation to the next.</p><h3> 3 Ways to Use Life Insurance for Wealth Transfer</h3><p> <br/> Life insurance can be an effective vehicle for transferring wealth to your heirs while avoiding inheritance taxes. While the federal exemption for estate taxes have been raised to $5.43 million for 2015, there are still state inheritance taxes to consider. There are several states in the U.S. where you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be caught dead, from an estate planning perspective.</p><p> Of course, such policies have to be set up correctly. Life insurance payouts are generally free of income tax, but they are still subject to inheritance taxes if they are owned by the insured. That is, if you own a policy on yourself, then it is considered part of your estate.</p><p> Here are three examples of how permanent life insurance can be used for wealth transfer:</p><li> <strong>  Set up an irrevocable life insurance trust. </strong>  You would then gift premiums to the trust &mdash; as long as the gifts are under the annual gift tax exemption, you wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about paying gift tax. The beneficiary of the policy would be the trust rather than your estate, so the policy wouldn&rsquo;t be included in your estate for estate tax purposes. The proceeds of the trust would then be distributed to your children or grandchildren, however you set it up. The downside of this approach is that, because the owner of the policy is an irrevocable trust, you have no access to that policy. You give up any access to it in exchange for the tax benefits.</li><li> <strong>  Use a survivorship policy. </strong>  If you might need access to the cash value of the policy, you can use a survivorship policy, one that covers multiple people and doesn&rsquo;t pay out until the last person passes away. Initially, the policy would be owned by one of the insured, but when the first insured passes, the policy would then move into a trust. The trust becomes the beneficiary, avoiding estate tax because the survivorship policy pays the death benefit on the last death, not the first death.</li><li> <strong>  Insure the children for the benefit of the grandchildren. </strong>  This can be a very cost-effective way for people in their 60s or 70s to use life insurance for wealth transfer in a &ldquo;skip generation&rdquo; strategy. Generation 1 owns the policy, so they can have access to the cash if they want, but then when they die, the policy goes into a trust for the benefit of generation 3. <br/>  </li><p> These are complex matters, so you will want to discuss these items with your financial and legal advisors to determine what post-retirement life insurance strategies make sense for you.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 18:17:32.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 18:17:32.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Nsmdwse.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-need-life-insurance-when-you-retire/\", \"post_id\": \"5102\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 18:17:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 18:17:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-need-life-insurance-when-you-retire\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5101\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2299\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PennMutual_RayCaucci_Do-You-Need-Life-Insurance-When-You-Retire_FINAL.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"352\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438342200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2254,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Consultative Selling Relevant?","link":"is-consultative-selling-relevant","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Question: </strong></p><p> Over the years, I have adopted what I consider to be a consultative approach to selling.  Lately, I&rsquo;ve left  meetings feeling a little &ldquo;unfinished&rdquo;.  I spend so much time asking questions that I feel there is inadequate time for presenting solutions.  Is it time to adopt a new model of selling?</p><p> <strong>  Answer: </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re asking if consultative selling is obsolete, the answer is no.  Some experts feel that transactional selling has prevailed over the last couple of years, however all agree that consultative selling is more important now than ever.  We agree.   Perhaps the definition of consultative selling needs to be visited.  Some salespeople define consultative selling by what it&rsquo;s not; not using a standard approach, not overdoing features and benefits, not talking too much, etc.  While these are all probable pieces of a consultative sales model, they are not the complete picture.   It sounds like you have fallen into a trap that many salespeople have.  Over the years, consultative selling has been promoted as the way to sell, and I agree.  However, the key word is sell.  There are those that believe that consultative selling means that you only ask questions and solutions will develop on their own.  While asking questions is a key to uncovering needs, if that&rsquo;s all you do on your sales calls you will disappoint yourself and your customer.</p><p> If a customer takes time out of their presumably busy schedule to meet with you, they must be interested in what you can offer them.  They just don&rsquo;t want to know everything about what you offer!  Asking questions alone without making recommendations causes the customer to feel empty, like they wasted their time.</p><p> Consultative selling is somewhat of a well-timed dance.   Dancers that are in-tune to each other seem glide, anticipating every turn and movement.  Ideally, customer interactions should feel the same way.  In a recent class on consultative selling, I asked the group to define what consultative selling was.  I like the definition they came up with, &ldquo;Consultative selling is to identify needs and suggest solutions that help a customer solve problems or more adequately reach their goals.&rdquo;   This is more of a collaboration between salesperson and customer rather than the more self-servicing sales models.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re feeling &ldquo;unfinished&rdquo;, it may be that you are spending too much time asking empty questions.  You should never feel like you are firing off questions.  The questions you ask should be the result of pre-call analysis that reveals what you know and what you need to find out.  Questions should be strategically woven into the conversation to produce the desired result.   The most fulfilling consultative sales situation is when you help the customer uncover a better means of accomplishing their goals.  Asking the right questions is key to getting to that point.  However, questions are like the tools of a mechanic.  You don&rsquo;t pull out a wrench when you need a hammer.  Each question you ask should be purposeful.  For instance:</p><p> <strong>  Help customers reveal needs by asking questions about their goals </strong>  &ndash; These should not be general questions, but questions that relate to how you might help them.  For instance, if you were selling office machinery, you might ask them how productive their office staff is.  Listen for gaps that you can fill.  Ask open-ended questions to provoke thought and uncover needs.  You should think these through in advance of your sales calls.  Start by asking what you know about the customer and what you need to know.</p><p> <strong>  Ask questions that reveal value for the customer </strong>  &ndash; &ldquo;What would a 10% increase in productivity mean to your bottom line?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Check the pulse of the customer by asking involvement questions </strong>  &ndash; These tell you how close a customer is to a commitment.  As customers reach a decision, they begin to think about how your suggestion will fit into their situation.  So, you ask specific questions about how they will use your product of service in advance of the sale.  How they answer tells you where they are mentally.  For example, &ldquo;If you decide to go ahead with this, what plant will you want to have trained first?&rdquo;  If the customer&rsquo;s response, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought about it.&rdquo;, you have a bit more selling to do.  If the customer&rsquo;s response is, &ldquo;I was hoping to start with the Waukesha plant,&rdquo; close the sale!</p><p> <strong>  Ask questions to position a solution </strong>  &ndash; &ldquo;Keeping up with technology is difficult these days, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  If the customer agrees that this is a challenge for them, you would present the applicable solution to solve their issue.</p><p> Here are some additional tips to ensure that you have adequate time to position solutions during your sales calls:</p><p> <strong>  Position a single solution after each discovery instead of waiting until the end </strong> &ndash; Doing so will enable you to keep the customer involved in the conversation   and build interest throughout the sales call.  The customer will see the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s In It For Me?&rdquo;  throughout your interaction.</p><p> <strong>  Set expectations up front </strong>  &ndash; Position why you are there and what you expect to  accomplish.  This will ensure that you and the customer are on the same page right from the start.  You could simply state something like, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to do today.  I&rsquo;d like to review your need for just in time inventory and your current  practices to see if we can help you meet your requirements.  Is that what you expect?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Schedule a follow-up meeting to present solutions </strong>  &ndash; Don&rsquo;t assume that you have   to accomplish the entire sales process in one meeting.</p><p> <strong>  Only provide solutions that are of value to that specific customer </strong>  &ndash; You may  indeed offer many valuable features and benefits.  The only ones that matter are  those that apply specifically to that customer&rsquo;s concerns.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t think of consultative selling as a single event  </strong> &ndash; Take regular tours of your customer&rsquo;s production areas to help you understand their challenges.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 18:12:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 18:12:46.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_FSpwIOq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-consultative-selling-relevant/\", \"post_id\": \"5099\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 18:12:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 18:12:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-consultative-selling-relevant\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5100\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2298\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1433208406127-d9e1a0a1f1aa-copy_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"787\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438343100,"author_id":319,"chart_url":""}

We begin our session with looking at why difficult people trip us up.</p><h3> Seven Myths and Ways To Face Difficult People: <br/>  </h3><h3>  1. We Can Wish Them Away</h3><p> <br/> There is an old adage that if we wish hard enough, the difficult people in our jobs and lives will disappear. Well, just the opposite is true. We may believe we can &ldquo;will&rdquo; them away, but difficult people are here to stay. And just when one leaves, another arrives. So the first step in facing difficult people is  <strong>  recognizing that they are and will always be part of our work environments. </strong></p><h3> 2. They Have Control Over Us</h3><p> <br/> This myth is one of the craziest ones in dealing with difficult people. We oftentimes feel they have power over us. ABSOLUTELY NOT! They can only control us if we allow them to.</p><li> We need to speak up and share our concerns in an assertive and respectful way</li><li> We can&rsquo;t just ignore the behavior if it is affecting our relationship and performance</li><li> We need to describe the behavior in non-judgmental terms</li><li> We can talk to a co-worker, colleague, boss or friend and ask how they might handle the situation <br/>  </li><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Leaders+face+difficult+people+in+a+clear+and+respectful+way.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/07/27/seven-ways-to-face-difficult-people/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Leaders face difficult people in a clear and respectful way  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 3. We Are The Only Ones</h3><p> <br/> Contrary to what we may be feeling, take comfort in knowing that all of us have difficult people to deal with. But what is fascinating is that what seems like difficult behavior for one person may not be difficult for another. Have you ever noticed that certain team members really get on your nerves but don&rsquo;t seem to bother others? That&rsquo;s because each of us reacts differently to the same behaviors or attitudes. Each of us brings our own unique imprint of what we think is  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2013/03/13/whats-a-leader-to-do-about-conflict/#sthash.s68hqhCi.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   difficult behavior  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 4. We Are Not Contributing </h3><p> <br/> Do you think that you are not impacting how the difficult person is acting towards you? No behavior takes place in a vacuum. In some way we might be rewarding the behavior. Maybe the individual is a whiner and we give in because we can&rsquo;t put up with the whining. So think about how you may be reinforcing a difficult person&rsquo;s actions.</p><h3> 5. Our Success Is Measured by How They React</h3><p> <br/> Our success needs to be measured by how we deal with the difficult person, not by how they react. It is not our job to make a negative person not negative. We can&rsquo;t force an aggressive person to be less aggressive. We just need to stand up for our rights.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=When+we+stand+up+for+ourselves+and+speak+out+we+are+leading.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/07/27/seven-ways-to-face-difficult-people/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   When we stand up for ourselves and speak out we are leading  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 6. We Have No Skills To Effectively Deal With Them</h3><p> <br/> The best way to deal with a difficult person is to use  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/02/02/whats-in-your-leadership-cereal-bowl/#sthash.ecP2YsNF.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   assertive communication  </a> </u>  that is:</p><li> Clear</li><li> Open</li><li> Direct</li><li> Respectful <br/>  </li><h3> 7. We May Actually Be The Difficult Person</h3><p> <br/> This is the realization that some of us may come to see. Yes, some of us may actually be the difficult person. Keep that in mind.</p><p> <strong>  What strategies have you used to lead when dealing with difficult people? </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 18:04:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 18:04:57.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_VDs5P2x.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/seven-ways-to-face-difficult-people/\", \"post_id\": \"5097\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 18:04:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 18:04:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"seven-ways-to-face-difficult-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5096\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2297\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Dealing-with-Difficult-people-580x280.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"328\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438344000,"author_id":476,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2252,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Robo Platforms Are Missing Personality","link":"robo-platforms-are-missing-personality","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In the last couple of years, Robo investment platforms have taken an important position in serving the middle and lower markets for financial planning. They are here to stay and should be encouraged. The question is does the Robo model for investments in its current format completely work? Like many new innovations, the problems are somewhat hidden when the markets are hidden. Where the Robo platform is completely stand-alone and totally independent of direct advisor input then the risks increase.</p><p> Then, also let&rsquo;s consider what do investors want? Gallup research shows only 9% of investors want a completely automated service, and this is mainly the younger investor. Therefore, 91% of investors want some human input in their financial planning. Refer to the following <a href=\"http://financialadvisoriq.com/c/1148733/123753/investors_want_both_humans_robo_advisors?referrer_module=emailMorningNews\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   research  </u> </a> :</p><p> The issue I see emerging for Robo platforms is that when there is a sharp and/or sustained correction downwards then there could be a mass exodus with a bloodbath of losses. After all, behavioral finance research shows us, people will, in varying degrees, make emotional decisions at the wrong time and follow the herd out of the market. Yes, the Robo platform may have many clients, but they will not be able to communicate with them when negative events happen. Similarly, there is no incentive for the Robo platform to communicate with investors as the market keeps going up and many get out of their comfort zone. In fact, the Robo is incentivized to keep having these people sign-up.</p><p> Overall, the structural problem for Robo platforms, as they currently stand, is that they do not know enough of the in-depth financial personality of the investor. The investor is served in a &ldquo;one-size fits all&rdquo; way based on a set of algorithms which have no relationship to who they are. The downsides are the Robo Platform does not know:</p><li> How to communicate with each investor on their unique terms. Put another way, they do not know how to re-frame information so that it is understandable to the investor.</li><li> The behavioral biases of each investor which will drive their decision-making (for instance to name a few, loss aversion, following the herd, taking a consolidated view, over trading).</li><li> The correct risk profile which will influence portfolio allocation. Some of the Robo&rsquo;s have a few questions that relate to risk and others make potentially false assumptions based on demographic data. Not all Millennial&rsquo;s and Gen Y&rsquo;s with a high income are risk-takers. <br/>  </li><p> The Robo platform would be greatly strengthened if it had a validated financial personality discovery process incorporated into it. The ROI would be significant in the following areas:</p><li> The ability to customize communications from the first point of engagement in the sign-up process. This would not help the initial sign-up process but also ongoing marketing.</li><li> Enhance the capability to manage investor emotions in volatile markets.</li><li> Provide a more robust framework for making suitable recommendations to meet compliance requirements and also monitor them. <br/>  </li><p> Ultimately, a Robo investment platform will not be sustainable on a long-term basis if there are no mechanisms to &ldquo;Know, Engage, and Grow&rdquo; the investor clients. This means that there must be robust online solutions to discover the client&rsquo;s financial personality and a place for human interaction. These elements can be incorporated on a cost-effective basis and to achieve scalability which is needed to bring financial planning to the masses in a safer way.</p> ","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 17:56:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 17:56:24.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_mFyQFry.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/robo-platforms-are-missing-personality/\", \"post_id\": \"5095\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 17:56:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 17:56:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"robo-platforms-are-missing-personality\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5094\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2296\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robot_Blue.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1991\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438340400,"author_id":199,"chart_url":""}

The heartbeat of our agency is our ability to deepen our relationships with our clients and the media alike.  Here is a Q&amp;A featuring  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.unitedcp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   United Capital&rsquo;s  </a> </u>  Leslie Dunham who chatted with Jimmy Moock, a Senior VP and Team Leader here, about her firm&rsquo;s view on our five years of collaboration with United Capital.  <u>  Leslie Dunham </u>  is vice president of marketing and brand management at United Capital.  Her responsibilities include developing and executing a clearly defined marketing and communication strategy in a manner that supports United Capital&rsquo;s business objectives. Her 21 year marketing career began at Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Private Portfolio Group. Enjoy! <strong>  JM: The financial marketplace is crowded and confusing, creating a never-ending challenge for today&rsquo;s RIAs to set themselves apart. Can you shed a little light on how we&rsquo;re tackling that communication challenge together? </strong> <strong>  LD: </strong>  I feel that the one thing that everyone in this industry believes is that they&rsquo;re putting the clients&rsquo; best interests first. But not everyone is walking that talk. I think  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  understands we are aligned with our clients. In a lot of ways, we&rsquo;re showcasing that from a public relations standpoint by engaging people with the things we are doing differently that focus on the client and his or her behaviors and needs. Sometimes it&rsquo;s weaving in our  <u>  Honest Conversations </u> &reg; and  <u>  Money Mind </u> &reg; Analyzer exercises into your media outreach to highlight our ability to engage clients. Sometimes it&rsquo;s (our CEO)  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duranmoney\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Joe Duran&rsquo;s  </a> </u>   <u>  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Money-Code-Improve-Entire-Financial/dp/1608324354/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476370135&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=money+code\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   latest book  </a> </u> . All of this supports our narrative that it&rsquo;s not the usual service line of &ldquo;we care about our clients.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s safe to say that in every outbound material we develop together, we&rsquo;re offering the proof which supports our claim that we are a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.unitedcp.com/finlife/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financial life management  </a> </u>  firm. <strong>  JM: </strong> <strong>  How does a firm make the most of their investment in PR? </strong> <strong>  LD: </strong>  The way I look at it, and the way our  <u>  CMO Gail Graham </u>  looks at it, is that public relations is the best branding exercise you can perform as a firm, especially when you consider costs. With smart, strategic PR, you&rsquo;re able to gain the widest reach possible. Internally, we&rsquo;re no less than shocked when people don&rsquo;t find the value of an investment in PR. Companies spend tens of thousands on a single advertisement that&rsquo;s usually ignored. Really?Also, we track our work together, which we share with our Executive Team and ultimately our Board of Directors, through your reports on the results of our strategies and efforts. We can compare our success to that of our competitors and it tells us &ndash; quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year &ndash; where we need to devote more effort and resources and where we&rsquo;re leading the way. Your reporting has enabled us to stay focused on multiple tracks at the same time.  I like the ability to start each week with our Monday morning call where we review the PR tracking grid and everything in the pipeline. It holds us both accountable to what we are producing and also will show us what&rsquo;s working versus what isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s much more of a tactical operation than people think on both tracks &ndash; B2B and B2C. Too many people think it&rsquo;s just people writing press releases, sending them out and hoping it draws the interest of a reporter. That&rsquo;s yesterday&rsquo;s way of doing this. <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/leslie-dunham-quote.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"leslie-dunham-quote\" src=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/leslie-dunham-quote.png\"/> </a> <strong>  JM: We&rsquo;ve been United Capital&rsquo;s partner since 2010 and you&rsquo;ve been on board since May of 2011. What makes a good PR partnership between agency and a growing financial firm like yours? </strong> <strong>  LD:  </strong> What a fun, wild ride you&rsquo;ve come along with us on.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  has seen us through our huge phase of growth. You&rsquo;ve seen us as a firm that&rsquo;s come in with a handful of different logos and communication styles and you&rsquo;ve been with us while we&rsquo;ve become a unified brand. I believe when we started together we had about 20 offices, now we have more than 70 across the country. What you&rsquo;ve seen and helped guide us through is one of the reasons I refer to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  as part of the family. You and Brittany understand our interworkings, and you feel comfortable enough to be proactive and outspoken with us. A bond built on trust only comes with knowing and working with the same group for that long and going through the &ldquo;growing pains&rdquo; together. And, these growing pains have offered us the ability to reset the ground rules of working together. The ability to take our pointed direction on one issue and feel comfortable enough to tell us when you feel like we are going down the wrong path on another is invaluable. Or, when Brittany alerts us to oddly worded phrase on our site. Instances like this tell me, Gail and Joe that you have our back and best interests always in mind. No matter your industry, if you&rsquo;re churning through PR firms, you&rsquo;re never going to be able to build a true partnership. Of course there are bad vendors and those engagements need to end, but that&rsquo;s a whole other story. <strong>  JM: Talk to me about how PR &amp; marketing departments work together while still being separate functions. How do we help you and your colleagues internally with our work/results?   </strong> <strong>  LD: </strong>  Let me count the ways! When I joined United Capital, I was the only person in the marketing department and now we have 11 people &ndash; there&rsquo;s that growth again. We have segmented everything from B2B, B2C, digital and social and overall branding.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  is always willing to jump in and help &ndash; whether its support with Twitter, Facebook, our blogs &ndash; you have the ability to literally make our lives easier. For instance, it completely streamlines the process for us when you guys deliver the social posts and make that content easily shareable across our social channels. As we adopt more and more marketing automation tools and strategies, the content that you provide or earn through the media easily accounts for 40 to 50 percent of our social posts. We now have about 60 advisers involved in our social campaigns who are also able to share that content.You are also keenly aware of our brand and understand how it is truly different than the rest of the financial universe, but even better, you treat us that way. You don&rsquo;t talk to us like you might a wirehouse. So, when you are approaching us with ideas or feedback, you approach us from a vantage point that is very supportive of our overall goals.Also, we know your team is always there. If something is going down you will hop on your phone, with baby in arm and make sure we are getting it done. It&rsquo;s the trust factor, which is huge for us. From Joe to Gail to me, when we&rsquo;re shooting an idea around, we&rsquo;ll often ask, &ldquo;Did you run it by Jimmy?&rdquo; Or they will call or text you themselves. It&rsquo;s definitely that level of trust and knowing  you always have our best interest at heart. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 17:47:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 17:47:34.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Pw3HGhj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-leading-rias-perspective-on-working-with-a-top-financial-pr-firm/\", \"post_id\": \"5093\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 17:47:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 17:47:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-leading-rias-perspective-on-working-with-a-top-financial-pr-firm\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5092\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2295\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/United-Capital-Leslie-Dunham.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"861\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438345800,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

They would review the latest company project, and offer their uncensored comments in what was considered safe and neutral territory. It led to some of their best ideas. Even chatting at the water cooler will help your business.</p><p> This created a bond between the workers and management, a situation that would not have existed had it not been for the 30 minutes or so every week that the group got to know everyone a little bit better, or heard about suggestion that might improve profits, or bring something new to the office environment, or really told it like it was, no matter how popular or unpopular the idea.</p><p> This kind of communication &ndash; even the chitchat around the water cooler &ndash; always went a long way towards the development of richer and deeper employee relationships, which, in turn, improved morale and productivity. But I fear that this notion is withering, dying, and ready for the last rites.</p><h3> Why?</h3><p> <br/> For a whole host of reasons.</p><li> More and more businesses are downsizing, or outsourcing, which means fewer employees for one thing, and fewer opportunities for mingling, and meeting up at the coffee station.</li><li> Also, businesses are going the way of part time workers, or using more temps, which means more unfamiliarity in the office as people come and go without time or a reason to socialize.</li><li> Lastly, we as a society get so offended, and have become a more litigious society. We are ready to sue over minor transgressions. Employee handbooks went through a major rewrite in recent years due to new rules on sexual discrimination, or off color comments, or over cultural differences; mandatory classes were given on how to avoid personnel issues in the workplace; and more topics were more taboo so that we just, as they say in submarine movies, &ldquo;went silent.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> And that is just a sad state of affairs.</h3><p> <br/> Basically I am arguing that we need to institute processes that encourage more informal communication, something I like to refer to as the &ldquo;water cooler&rdquo; concept. Offices should have open spaces for informal conversations, break rooms to get coffee, reasons to step away from the cubicle and to encourage face to face responses, rather than emails to the person across the room. My old boss used to walk through the various departments and ask if his employees had everything they needed, or if there were ideas to make improvements. It provided for positive and relaxed interactions that sometimes generated a new idea, but always generated good feelings.</p><p> Loosen up your organization by trying some of these ideas:</p><li> Pay for staff lunches, or family-friendly after-hour activities, and offer incentives to encourage all staffers to take part;</li><li> Include part-time staff in all activities; encourage and promote efforts to showcase new employees;</li><li> Provide cozy spaces for lunch and coffee breaks; <br/> Support health and wellness with informative sessions on kicking the smoking habit, fitness, weight loss, nutrition;</li><li> Offer opportunities for staff to attend cultural events in the community with their families and do informal reviews for colleagues. Offer these tickets in a monthly raffle, but make sure that everyone gets a turn. <br/>  </li><p> The goal should be to encourage informal communication, improve social relations, and let your most valued resource &ndash; your employees &ndash; know that their lives, their suggestions, and their place in your business is valued.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 17:39:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 17:39:39.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_KxhUAls.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-the-water-cooler-will-help-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"5091\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 17:39:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 17:39:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-the-water-cooler-will-help-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5090\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2294\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1433959352364-9314c5b6eb0b-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"725\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438362000,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2249,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Like Goldilocks, Millennials Are Seeking Financial Advice That's Just Right","link":"like-goldilocks-millennials-are-seeking-financial-advice-thats-just-right","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This article orginally appeard in Millennial Magazine. </p><p> As Millennials are poised to become the largest generation of savers, supplanting Baby Boomers as the generation with the largest impact on the American economy, skepticism about investing in the stock market is surprisingly rampant and  <strong>  financial advice </strong>  is often overlooked.</p><p> According to research released by Goldman Sachs last month, only 18% of the young adults surveyed trusted the stock market as &ldquo;the best way to save for the future.&rdquo; The flip side of that &ndash; uninvested &ndash; coin is that 82% of Millennials may not believe the market is their best investment choice: 20% because they &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t know enough about the stock market&rdquo; and 16% because they thought &ldquo;stocks are too volatile&rdquo; or &ldquo;the marketplace isn&rsquo;t fair for small investors.&rdquo;</p><p> With the S&amp;P 500 historically producing average yearly returns of about 7%, savings accounts and CDs yielding 1% or less, and the jar in the closet 0% &ndash; why are so many younger investors choosing to sit it out? Diversified investment strategies that take risk-tolerance into account generally provide much better opportunities and results than leaving savings to trail inflation rates, and yet many Millennials are doing just that, preferring the piggy bank to the market.</p><p> Like Goldilocks, Millennials may be waiting for the bed, the chair, or the financial service provider that is &ldquo;just right&rdquo; but, unlike Goldilocks, they may not know where to look for the one that suits them best.</p><h3> Financial Advice from Investment Companies</h3><p> <br/> Large firms with high minimums and high asset requirements &ndash; and some fee-only solutions with daunting initial retainer fees &ndash; may be &ldquo;too hard&rdquo; for many Millennials, who are just starting out and find it difficult to come up with the minimums required.</p><p> Algorithm-based &ldquo;robo&rdquo; solutions may be appealing in their affordability but, given that most provide a limited number of models, without customization or personalization, they may be &ldquo;too soft&rdquo; and too limited for many Millennials, who are looking for solutions that are more focused on, and tailored to, their individual needs, goals, and preferences. Many are investment services only and do not provide the kind of holistic financial planning that includes buying a first home, saving for education, insurance, estates and trust advice, and other important financial planning considerations.</p><p> While Millennials are waiting for financial advice that is &ldquo;just right&rdquo;, they may be losing out on significant future rewards. That&rsquo;s because the earlier they start investing, the sooner they will begin reap the rewards of compounded returns and the more they can potentially earn from a company&rsquo;s matching 401(k) program.</p><p> So what is preventing Millennials from finding the financial advice that&rsquo;s right for them and finding it sooner rather than later?</p><h3> Debt</h3><p> <br/> Much has been written about the debt being carried by Millennials and it&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s an important factor. But without a thorough analysis of the interest rate they are paying on their debt, it can be difficult to determine whether it is more advantageous to save &ndash; and invest &ndash; or prioritize paying down the debt first. While it makes sense to pay down debt with a high rate of interest quickly, it is also wise to consider the potential advantages of certain savings opportunities such as employer plans that offer matching contributions.</p><h3> Desirability</h3><p> <br/> Millennials are often marginalized based on age or income and profitability when it comes to receiving financial services. They do not meet the minimum asset requirement for many larger firms, and even some smaller firms may not be interested in speaking with them. Some financial advisors may take on clients&rsquo; Millennial children as a value-added service for their older, more affluent clients, but those advisors may not always be giving the younger investor their full attention or understand the difference in their younger clients&rsquo; priorities.</p><h3> Cost</h3><p> <br/> Even fee-based services may be too expensive for younger investors who are just starting out. And Millennials may have been put off by experiences with smaller, non-fiduciary, financial service providers who may not understand their unique needs and goals.</p><h3> Attention</h3><p> <br/> Because they have easy access to a &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; of information on the Internet, 43% of the participants in the Goldman Sachs study said they would not spend more than an hour getting guidance on investing and 3% said that they wouldn&rsquo;t seek any advice at all. This is the single most startling, and most worrisome, finding of the Goldman Sachs survey. Many young investors may have to learn the hard way that it&rsquo;s not easy to build a solid financial future in one hour. Investing in a few productive hours with a good financial advisor can more than pay off in building a foundation for creating a strong financial future.</p><h3> Comfort</h3><p> <br/> As Goldman Sachs points out: &ldquo;Millennials have grown up in a time of rapid change, giving them a set of priorities and expectations sharply different from previous generations.&rdquo; Millennials have a distinct world-view, and are looking for advisors and advice that complement how them see themselves, their priorities, and their future. They don&rsquo;t relate to large, detached firms; they are looking for personal &ndash; and personalized attention &ndash; something not all firms provide. With technological resources evolving daily and with data available almost instantly, digital natives feel more comfortable with advisors who understand and integrate the tech tools that can make the process more efficient. At the same time, paradoxically, they want connection and a personal relationship with an advisor who gets them, who gets their choices, relationships, and personal financial goals and can customize an individualized and evolving plan that is right for them.</p><p> Financial advisors have a lot of work to do, to connect with the youngest &ndash; and potentially most powerful &ndash; generation in history. Helping Millennials understand that debt, assets, cost, relatability, and efficiency are not barriers to entry is an important first step in helping Millennials on a path to a secure financial future. Providing them with the kind of customized, tech-savvy, and personalized service they expect is the next step.</p><p> But Millennials have a responsibility too, and it&rsquo;s an important one because it&rsquo;s a responsibility to their own future and finding a financial advisor who helps them focus on achieving their own, unique goals. As Carl Richards wisely wrote, &ldquo;When it comes to investing, the only goal that matters is yours.&rdquo; The sooner Millennials get off the sidelines, seek professional advice, then get started working toward achieving their own goals, the sooner they will be able to realize their own visions of a financial future that is &ldquo;just right.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 17:19:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 17:19:42.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_eItVEMC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/like-goldilocks-millennials-are-seeking-financial-advice-thats-just-right/\", \"post_id\": \"5089\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 17:19:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 17:19:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"like-goldilocks-millennials-are-seeking-financial-advice-thats-just-right\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5088\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2293\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lead_large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"563\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438351200,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2248,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"11 Ways To Tell If You're Ready To Date","link":"11-ways-to-tell-if-youre-ready-to-date","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A client recently asked me about my love life. &ldquo;How do you decide when you&rsquo;re ready to start dating after a breakup?&rdquo;</p><p> Instead of acting like a coach, I decided to lay out the action plan I use. Self-disclosure, when done correctly, can be a powerful and healing tool with clients. And since my last relationship ended a few months ago, I figured the Universe needed me to hear what I was about to tell her.</p><p> First, let&rsquo;s address the question I'm always asked (and ask myself) after a breakup:</p><h3> How Long Should I Wait Before I Can Date Again?</h3><p> People ask me this for a few reasons:</p><li> They have an underlying belief in scarcity. They don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;waste time&rdquo; because they feel their chances of meeting the right person decrease with age.</li><li> They think a rebound will help them move forward. (I blame snarky, well-intentioned friends for gems like \"The best way to get over someone is by getting under someone else.\" WRONG.)</li><li> They don&rsquo;t feel ready and instead feel scared or overwhelmed. They wonder if/when they&rsquo;ll be able to fully open themselves up to love or even be interested in pursuing a partner.</li><li> They want to play it safe by avoiding the potential to be hurt again.</li><li> They don&rsquo;t want to make the same mistakes again. <br/>  </li><h3> While many of these reasons may feel true, feelings aren&rsquo;t facts. <br/>  </h3><p> Reasons #1-5 are routed in fear.  Fear forces us to focus on what we don&rsquo;t want, and because of it, we wind up attracting the exact thing we&rsquo;re trying to avoid.</p><p> For example, if you were codependent in your last relationship and your partner was controlling or narcissistic, you may be telling yourself &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my next partner to be like that!&rdquo; You&rsquo;d think this protective measure keeps you safe, but all it does is reaffirm your beliefs about yourself. It also means that you're less likely to notice the good people you do meet.</p><p> So how long should you wait? It&rsquo;s different for everyone. I&rsquo;ve heard generalizations about half the length of your relationship. Or add on a year if there was infidelity or subtract a year if it was mutual. But equations aside, it comes down to you, your journey, and your beliefs.</p><p> I had a client recently ask me, it&rsquo;s been 3 months, am I ready to date? My response, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pretend you met a man who, like you, had been married for 5 years. On a first date he revealed he was divorced 3 months ago. How would you feel? Would you be comfortable with that?&rdquo; If you are, great! If not, wait.</p><p> So rather than focus on time, I like to focus on the benchmarks of emotional availability. And that brings us to the system I use to figure out if I&rsquo;m ready to date.</p><h3> How I Tell If I'm Ready To Date:</h3><h3> 1. I&rsquo;m out of the headspace of blame.</h3><p> I may not be over the loss of the person, but I&rsquo;m not ordering a Voodoo doll on Amazon Prime (cause anger requires 2 day shipping.) In other words, it&rsquo;s fine to still mourn the relationship itself, but if you&rsquo;re still harboring resentments, you won&rsquo;t be emotionally available for someone new.</p><h3> 2. I know what I want in a partner.</h3><p> It sounds obvious, but people who have a fuzzy sense of what they want only get a fuzzy version of that they want in return. I'm ready to move on if I&rsquo;ve revised my list of must haves, would like to haves, and won&rsquo;t haves to include specifics. For example, instead of saying &ldquo;I want someone who&rsquo;s intelligent&rdquo; I clarify what I want that intelligence to look like. Trust that when you define what it is that you want, you'll find it.</p><h3> 3. I&rsquo;m the right kind of selfish.</h3><p> My self care is a non-negotiable. It&rsquo;s the Foundation for everything I do. If my self-care is not where I&rsquo;d like it to be, I make sure to spend some extra time on it. Because when I&rsquo;m not feeling like my best self, I don&rsquo;t act like my best self.</p><h3> 4. I know myself.</h3><p> Sometimes after a relationship, we wake up wondering &ldquo;who the F$#! did I turn into?!\" If that happened, I get back to the hobbies and activities that connect me to myself. I remind myself of the things that light me up and the things that piss me off. Why? Because people with self-awareness are more likely to identify a partner who's right for them, get their needs met, and find happiness in a relationship, while still maintaining independence and personal growth. And isn&rsquo;t that what we all want and deserve?!</p><h3> 5. I&rsquo;m not looking for anyone to fix me.</h3><p> I&rsquo;m not broken, no one is. Sure, maybe there are things I&rsquo;d like to change in my life, but that&rsquo;s my job. It&rsquo;s not for my partner to do. Whatever you&rsquo;ve got going on, ask yourself whether you are ready and willing to address it head on. Stop waiting around to be \"saved\" and start saving yourself.</p><h3> 6. I&rsquo;m not trying to fix anyone.</h3><p> I&rsquo;ve got baggage and so will my partner. It's inevitable. And while it would be great to change people's annoying habits, I know how to accept people for who they are rather than who I want them to be. Your ability to compromise or cut ties will not only bring the right person in, it'll help you to weed out the wrong ones. Remember, you want a partner, not a fixer-upper.</p><h3> 7. I am emotionally and physically available.</h3><p> I ask myself whether I&rsquo;ve created space for a partner. No, that doesn't mean a drawer in your dresser (NYC real estate is insane!) It means I&rsquo;m willing and able to give and receive love. That also means I'm not killing time with \"Mr. Right Now\" as I wait to find a great partner.</p><h3> 8. I&rsquo;m okay with being flawed (even if I dont like it).</h3><p> I get that as much as I may try, I can't always be perfect. This annoys me. But I am willing to open myself up, be vulnerable, and occasionally risk looking like an idiot. I accept that being myself and receiving love yields a better outcome than being someone else and walking on eggshells.</p><h3> 9. I&rsquo;ve learned from the past.</h3><p> Until I&rsquo;ve taken the time to look at my role in my last relationship and address historical patterns, I&rsquo;m not ready to move on. Without doing that, I&rsquo;ll most likely repeat the same mistakes with a different cast of characters. Instead of only focusing on assessing your ex&rsquo;s shortcoming, take a look at how you could have acted differently. In other words, own your shit.</p><h3> 10. I know my triggers and patterns.</h3><p> While we all have blindspots, I&rsquo;ve carefully considered my triggers. These are the topics that make me go 0-60 in 6 seconds flat. The things that elicit a similar reaction to when my parents ask &ldquo;Are you ever planning on getting married?!&rdquo; Until you know your trigger points, dating will feel like a game of Minesweeper.</p><h3> 11. I don't feel like I need to.</h3><p> Ahhh, the irony of this one. I know I&rsquo;m ready to date when I&rsquo;m not doing because I &ldquo;should.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m not doing it to fill a literal or figurative hole in my life. When I feel like I can be single &amp; happy, I know I&rsquo;m ready to date.</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-30 17:08:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-30 17:08:55.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_IS3HLVU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/11-ways-to-tell-if-youre-ready-to-date/\", \"post_id\": \"5087\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-30 17:08:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-30 17:08:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"11-ways-to-tell-if-youre-ready-to-date\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5086\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2292\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-30-at-10.08.04-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"430\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438365600,"author_id":22,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2247,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"MuniLand: California Residential Water Conservation Effort Exceed Mandate","link":"muniland-california-residential-water-conservation-effort-exceed-mandate","source_link":null,"content":"<p> At the beginning of July California released data on its water conservation efforts.  <strong>  It is reported that residential water consumption fell 28.9% in May, which is better than the 25% mandated reduction. </strong> The credit impacts from reduced water and waste water (W/WW) consumption should be limited in the mid-term.  Mid to large W/WW credits exhibit robust covenants, flexible financial capacity, strong capital positions and generally conservative management practices. Mid to large systems rank higher in our credit process than small systems because they are more robust operators and their service areas typically have median household incomes above the national average. System characteristics also measure asset condition.  Asset Condition is the useful life of fixed asset in years.  Low asset lifespans is a credit negative because it presents operating risks such as failing pipes or an inability to meet environmental regulations.  Systems that have delayed upgrades need capital infusions, which generally means more debt and rate increases. When new debt is issued, most often it is backed by a net revenue pledge and debt service covenants of greater than 1.1x coverage. <strong>  While legal protection and covenants are important, our credit analysis is more vigorous. </strong></p><p> <strong>  California W/WW credits also exhibit significant financial capacity. </strong> The drought and conservation efforts have reduced water consumption, which means less sewage needs treatment and revenues fall.  Debt service coverage ratios are calculated on net system revenue basis (net of maintenance and operating cost).  Coverage ratios can be relatively stable even as revenues fall because maintenance and operating (M/O) costs fall as well.  For example, between FY&rsquo;13 and FY&rsquo;12, when water usage began to fall, San Diego Sewer M/O costs dropped 5.7% while revenue from charges for services only fell 2.3%. W/WW credits have significant financial flexibility to maintain pledged coverage ratios in the face of falling consumption. The question then turns to, what if all the efficiency gains are captured and revenues continue to fall due to reduced consumption?

{"original_id":2246,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Step Process Financial Advisers Should Follow To Grow Their Wealth","link":"4-step-process-financial-advisers-should-follow-to-grow-their-wealth","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Nigel Reid | <u>  Econnexx </u></p><h3> Effective processes enhance the rewards and lessen the work</h3><p> <br/> For financial advisers sometimes ambition and a drive to grow their wealth is thwarted by the processes they use. The financial services sector is one with many skilled and self motivated individuals who have a desire to grow but face limitations due the processes they implement, processes that they have inherited from their peers, processes that were once effective but significantly less so today. </p><p> Through the integration of online technology and the evolution of marketing strategies financial advisers are now entering an era of exciting opportunities. By embracing modern processes financial advisers will be able to grow their client bank and their wealth with less, but more concentrated effort.</p><p> Here is a simplified 4 stage process that if adopted will bring immense results.</p><h3> 1. Attract prospects to you</h3><p> <br/> The first and most important part of developing a process that drives results is to have an online profile. Many believe that by having a website or profile page that explains the service they offer and provides their telephone number and email address constitutes an online presence, but this simply is not effective and the likelihood is those who have such a profile will have seen little to no benefit from it. </p><p> For consumers to take action you need to give them a reason to do so. The internet has become the starting point for almost 90% of consumers who seek financial services. They search online before they even consider choosing a financial adviser because they want to learn about services that appeal specifically to their needs so they can understand what their options are.</p><p> So the key to attracting prospective clients is to provide them with information. This can be in the form of downloadable offerings such as &lsquo;5 Steps to a Wealthy Retirement&rsquo;. But how do you get people to your online profile so they can get the information they seek? The answer. Prospecting on social media.</p><p> Social media is filled with endless prospects who seek financial services. But currently social media is mainly used by financial advisers to connect with industry colleagues or share content that is irrelevant to prospective clients. </p><p> To attract prospects social media channels such as Linkedin and Twitter should be used to pinpoint your target client types, connect with them, then message them inviting them to visit your online profile by offering a relevant, enticing offer such as the one mentioned earlier. This process promotes you the adviser, and attracts your potential clients to learn more about the services that you provide that resonates with them. </p><p> <strong>  PROCESS 1 &ndash; Have an online profile that provides value and promote your profile through social media engagement. </strong></p><h3> 2. Convert visitors into contacts by giving them information</h3><p> <br/> Consumers no longer want to be sold to; they want information that enables them to make a decision based on the knowledge they have gained. </p><p> By providing consumers with a platform to learn and further their interest in a service; you immediately appear as a resource for information that they will continue to revert to. </p><p> By providing content offerings in exchange for the contact details of each visitor you gain a contact that can be nurtured to eventually take action. Nurturing prospects is significantly more effective than contacting them immediately as it enables you to keep in contact through emails, blog posts, social media and provide each contact with further information that ensures they only takes action when they are ready. </p><p> <strong>  PROCESS 2 &ndash; Become a resource for helpful, educational information that is beneficial to your visitors, which promotes you as a valuable asset and an expert in their eyes. Collect your visitors contact details in exchange for providing the information they download. </strong></p><h3> 3. Close prospects to clients through automation processes</h3><p> <br/> Once you have attracted visitors to your online profile and gained their contact details in exchange for providing them with content offerings you now have the ability to nurture those prospects until they are ready to take action.</p><p> To do this you will need to incorporate marketing automation software into your strategy. Through automated marketing you are able to collect and score data on every prospect, and schedule and deliver personalised, relevant content to meet each prospects needs, helping qualify their interest and move them closer to taking action.</p><p> This process provides 3 valuable results.</p><li> It enables consumers to learn about the services that are relevant to them through the delivery of personalised emails and content offerings.</li><li> It provides you with the data that allows you to learn about each prospect every time they open an email, download an offering and complete a form. Helping build detailed profiles on every prospect, which allows you to always deliver relevant messages.</li><li> It promotes the adviser who provided the content as an expert and an authority source. This means when a prospect is ready to purchase a financial service they will do so with the adviser who provided them with the information they sought. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  PROCESS 3 &ndash; Incorporate an automation strategy to build profiles and deliver pinpoint material to every prospect, helping them move closer to becoming your client. </strong></p><h3> 4. Delight prospects with your service</h3><p> <br/> By following the first 3 processes you will have attracted visitors, converted those visitors into contacts and nurtured those contacts until they are buyer ready. Therefore when it comes to actually speaking to a prospect you have already built a relationship with them and you know the service they want, making it easier for you to secure their custom.</p><p> Clients attained through these processes are also much more likely to be influenced by your content as you are now their authority for financial services. This means you can continue to remain in contact and use the data you have collected to build further personalised content strategies promoting other financial services that are applicable to their needs.</p><p> This process is entirely customer focused and helps build positive relationships. This makes your firm &lsquo;recommendable&rsquo;, which means the clients you have delighted through your customer focused processes will share their experiences with family, friends and even strangers through social media recommendations.</p><p> <strong>  PROCESS 4. Now that prospects are nurtured and sales ready you will be able to close a greater proportion of contacts into clients. Clients attained in such a manner are much more likely to recommend your firm to others.  </strong></p><p> By implementing these 4 processes you will have a financial firm that generates clients efficiently and effectively, enabling you to simply focus on servicing their needs. You no longer have to wonder where your next client is coming from or have to chase up cold leads, saving you time, effort, while securing your wealth and your firms future.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-29 18:22:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-29 18:22:16.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_lzPXYmo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-step-process-financial-advisers-should-follow-to-grow-their-wealth/\", \"post_id\": \"5082\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-29 18:22:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-29 18:22:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-step-process-financial-advisers-should-follow-to-grow-their-wealth\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5081\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2289\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438089966501-33bb60deddf6.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"437\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438255800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Sounds strange, doesn&rsquo;t it &ndash; but I&rsquo;ll explain. <br/> <br/> Recently, during my morning walk, I saw a woman with her friend heading towards me.  As we passed, the woman who was dominating most of the sidewalk failed to move over, and as a result jammed into my shoulder. Ouch! <br/> <br/> I have heard similar stories from employees about navigating the hallways at work. <br/> <br/> Sharing public space, whether it&rsquo;s on sidewalks or in hallways, is a common cause of conflict, and an ongoing concern for pedestrians and office workers alike.  <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/16/nyregion/think-you-own-the-sidewalk-etiquette-by-new-york-pedestrians-is-showing-a-strain.html\" target=\"_blank\">   The New York Times  </a> </u>  wrote about this problem some years ago, and recently  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/the-nyc-department-of-pedestrian-etiquette-is-serious-this-time-no-clumping-7370169\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Village Voice  </a> </u>  ran a tongue-in-cheek article about the (fake) New York Department of Pedestrian Etiquette, which would require all pedestrians to receive etiquette training for navigating the city&rsquo;s walkways.  <br/> <br/> I don&rsquo;t think most people who crowd colleagues or fellow pedestrians are deliberately trying to be rude &ndash; they&rsquo;re often unaware of their behavior and how it affects others. Yet, if we want things to change, the change starts with us. The New York City etiquette training is not real, of course. But fortunately you don&rsquo;t need official training to learn to negotiate common spaces politely. You simply need to follow these 6 guidelines: <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Make room for others. </strong>  If you are walking with other people and taking up most or all of the sidewalk/hallway, it is your responsibility to make room for any other person coming towards you.  In doing so, don&rsquo;t wait until the last moment. Move over before you bump into someone.</p><p> <strong>  2. Pay attention to your surroundings. </strong> When you stop to chat with people, don&rsquo;t block the sidewalk/hallway. You should move to one side so others can pass. People shouldn&rsquo;t have to walk around you or push past you. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t walk and text on the phone. </strong> One professor said that students on their phones constantly bump into her in her school&rsquo;s narrow hallways. She noted that when texting, her students become oblivious of others. And it&rsquo;s not just students: One woman in Florida walked into the path of a freight train while texting! Amazingly, she survived.   <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t cut too closely when passing someone. </strong> Doing so can be startling to the person you are cutting in front of &ndash; and the heels of your shoes may be stepped on. <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Greet people. </strong> If you make eye contact with someone, acknowledge them with a &ldquo;hello&rdquo; or &ldquo;good morning,&rdquo; a smile or a nod of the head. When you do so, you are letting them into your space and you are less likely to bump into them. Remember, you don&rsquo;t need to know someone to say hello.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Don&rsquo;t stop suddenly. </strong> People will bump into you.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-29 18:20:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-29 18:20:40.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_TpUH7Cc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-etiquette-rules-for-the-sidewalkand-other-walkways/\", \"post_id\": \"5080\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-29 18:20:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-29 18:20:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-etiquette-rules-for-the-sidewalkand-other-walkways\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5079\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2288\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/NY_SidewalkEtiquette.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1235\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438275600,"author_id":51,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2244,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Most Overused Word in Business","link":"the-most-overused-word-in-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Strategy has to be one of the most misused words in business. The word is tossed around boardrooms and customer meetings with reckless abandon. You&rsquo;ve likely heard this: &ldquo;Our strategy is to become the biggest and the best.&rdquo; Deciding to become a global corporation, to diversify, or to increase sales by x dollars per annum is not strategy. Such aspirations are goals or objectives. Articulating how to become the biggest and the best is the strategy. That strategy can be good or bad. The &ldquo;steel&rdquo; in strategy is its capacity to set the stage for an organization to achieve ironclad competitive advantage. Strategy is also a &ldquo;steal&rdquo; because good strategies cost no more to develop than bad ones. </p><p> Sounds simple enough? Not so fast. Even those leaders who understand strategy and its virtues are struggling to successfully implement.  <strong>  Booz &amp; Company&rsquo;s </strong>  survey of 3,500 global leaders, including 550 CEOs and 325 other C-suite executives report a serious lack of cohesion within their organizations. Consider these staggering statistics: 54% of respondents didn&rsquo;t believe their company&rsquo;s strategy will lead to success. 53% couldn&rsquo;t say whether their employees understood the strategy. Only a third believe the company&rsquo;s core capabilities fully support the corporate strategy. Ouch!</p><p> At the other end of the strategy conundrum are leaders and managers who don&rsquo;t understand strategy. Too often they mistake tactics for strategy. Tactics are the ever-important short term decisions and activities that win battles and contribute to winning the war. In traditional manufacturing companies, sales departments know tactics better than most other functions because sales people work with tactics every day. Big retailers are dead without a firm understanding of daily, weekly and monthly tactics. They have to decide when they will hold a sale, what brands they will promote, and how they will achieve one-upmanship on aggressive competitors.</p><p> Promoting <strong>   Coca-Cola </strong>  as a loss leader or trying to make a small or large profit margin on the brand is a tactic. If the retailer&rsquo;s unique position in the market is lowest prices for brand name items, then all pricing tactics must support that image. In this case, because of Coca-Cola&rsquo;s massive consumer appeal, a healthy retail margin that inflates the price of Coke would not be a wise decision. Selling Coke at a price above competition destroys the retailer&rsquo;s strategic positioning. Imagine the ramifications if  <strong>  Wal-Mart </strong> , known for lowest prices every day, made that move. On the other hand, a &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; retailer doesn&rsquo;t have to lose money on Coca-Cola. Their options are to either squeeze the Coca-Cola Company into lowering their cost for a period of time, or choosing another brand such as  <strong>  Pepsi </strong>  with similar consumer appeal. That&rsquo;s tactical decision-making.</p><p> People worry that strategy slows a company down and limits growth opportunities. The opposite is true. Just look at the success of  <strong>  Apple </strong> . Big. Fast. Focused. Innovative. This company managed to harness the resources of 72,000 employees to introduce and successfully market a slew of breakthroughs.  <strong>  Tim Cook </strong>  and  <strong>  Steve Jobs </strong>  before him were adamant in saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to thousands of projects so that they could focus on the few that were truly meaningful to Apple.</p><p> <strong>  Howard Schultz </strong>  grew  <strong>  Starbucks </strong>  at an outrageous pace. All it took was three decades for Starbucks to catapult from 50 stores in the Pacific Northwest to 21,000 stores worldwide, $13 billion in sales and $1.38 billion in profit. Schultz&rsquo;s vision for Starbucks was a social community with a defined culture that people would aspire to connect with, (over a cup of distinctive, dark-roasted coffee). Seemingly, the personality of the brand impacted every decision about the experience and the ambiance &ndash; the furniture, the artwork, the exotic names of the bean origins, even the music.</p><p> With so much written about the success of great companies led by outstanding strategic visionaries, one has to wonder why strategy is so misunderstood by so many of today&rsquo;s leaders.</p> ","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-29 18:13:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-29 18:13:49.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_SibpViR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-most-overused-word-in-business/\", \"post_id\": \"5078\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-29 18:13:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-29 18:13:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-most-overused-word-in-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5077\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2287\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438109954014-21b3cf55a0d0-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"670\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438264800,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}

In a nutshell, that&rsquo;s what appreciative leadership is all about. It&rsquo;s about recognizing and acknowledging the value that others bring to the table. It&rsquo;s about giving them the opportunity to show off what they know and what they can do that brings value to the project, the team, and the organization. It&rsquo;s about realizing that you do not have all of the answers, that you can&rsquo;t do it all by yourself. Your success and the success of your organization is dependent on your ability to embrace the strengths of others, to set your ego aside and let them shine, and to show sincere appreciation for specific, individual contributions.</p><h3> Values other&rsquo;s strengths</h3><p> <br/> Mattie Stepanek said, &ldquo;Unity is strength&hellip;when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved.&rdquo; While Mattie suggested that unity is strength, I take this one step further. What happens when we bring everyone&rsquo;s strengths to the table in a unified effort? What incredible things might we accomplish together? To be an appreciative leader, you must let go of your ego; it&rsquo;s not all about you and what you know, it&rsquo;s about the entire team and bringing each of their strengths together to achieve shared goals. Value the strengths of others and let them be strong where you are weak.</p><h3> Gives others the opportunity to shine</h3><p> <br/> Chris Hadfield believes, &ldquo;Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It&rsquo;s about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others&rsquo; success, and then standing back and letting them shine.&rdquo; Appreciative leaders bring out the best in others. They invest time and resources in developing their employees and then they get out of the way and let their employees shine. Show your employees that you believe in them and soon they will start believing in themselves.</p><h3>  Shows specific appreciation</h3><p> <br/> Ralph Marston told us to, &ldquo;Make it a habit to tell people thank you. To express your appreciation, sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return.&rdquo; Appreciative leaders let others know that they are of value and they give credit where credit is due. Everyone is unique and has something distinctive to offer; they want the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution and then to be recognized and valued on an individual level. While it&rsquo;s great to hear &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;; how much more meaningful is it hear &ldquo;Thank you, John, for the great job you did on the monthly sales report. Your graphs were amazing. I appreciate all the hard work you put into this project.&rdquo;?</p><h3> Start Today</h3><p> <br/> Start being an appreciative leader today. Your appreciation will engage and inspire your employees. It will set a great example of how to value and treat others. This type of leadership focuses on helping others succeed and then showing sincere appreciation for the value they bring to the organization. Your appreciative leadership will build teams that allow individuals to use their strengths for the greater good, give employees opportunities to shine, and will show appreciation that is specific and individualized. When employees feel appreciated, they will appreciate you in return. And, employees who appreciate their leaders are willing to walk through fire for them. Show appreciation, develop loyalty, and succeed as an appreciative leader.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-29 18:06:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-29 18:06:48.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_8qXzXCd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-steps-to-becoming-an-appreciative-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"5076\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-29 18:06:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-29 18:06:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-steps-to-becoming-an-appreciative-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5075\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2286\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438129499652-f373b9e3ec25-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"421\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438344000,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

Did you know that journey maps can help you design, redesign, and manage both customer and employee experiences through these challenging times? </strong> <br/> <br/> Let's face it: mergers and acquisitions are hard for everyone living through them, employees and customers alike. Sometimes mergers or acquisitions are made with the assumption that the resultant company will be better for customers and employees. Unfortunately, that's not always true. And if it is, it certainly doesn't happen immediately or without a diligent effort to make it so. In reality, companies spend years integrating systems, data, people, and more - and might even make additional acquisitions before the previous one is completely integrated. This can spell \"nightmare\" for customers. And for employees. <br/> <br/> I've  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/12/listening-to-customers-employees-during.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   written previously  </a> </u>  about the importance of continuing to listen to customers and employees during this time of change; if there's ever a time to listen and stay in tune with customers and employees, this is it! <br/> <br/> But how can journey maps help with \"easing\" and integrating acquisitions? <br/> <br/> For starters, you can  <strong>  map the current state </strong>  (prior to the merger or acquisition) for customers and for employees of both organizations to identify what's going well today and what's not. Just because you're going through this time of change doesn't mean you need to set aside your customer experience management efforts. (Assume the same for the employee experience for the rest of this post.) As a matter of fact, those efforts are more crucial now than ever. <br/> <br/> Take a look at the current state maps for both companies and uncover:</p><li> Where is the customer experience breaking down? Where is it going well?</li><li> Which channels are under-performing? Which are on point?</li><li> Where are we already listening to customers? Where do we need to do a better job of listening?</li><li> What can we learn from the other company's customer experience?</li><li> Are there things happening in the acquired company that the acquirer can benefit from? or vice versa?</li><li> Are there experience gaps that one company can fill for the other? <br/>  </li><p> Once you've done your homework on the current state, you'll want to consider what  <strong>  the desired future state </strong>  (with both companies - and their products and customers - combined) looks like in order to identify further gaps, areas for improvement, and more. Be sure to include the customer perspective and his voice throughout this entire process. <br/> <br/> Oftentimes the journey mapping exercise is more important than the maps themselves. The exercise keeps the customer front and center and keeps the organization talking about and aware of, at all times, what the customer is thinking and feeling about the new company. <br/> <br/> Continuing to focus on the customer experience during times of change lets customers know they are still at the center of the business. Staying the course and not taking your eye off the customer experience during transitional times is huge. Companies in this position must...</p><li> Focus on the journey, not just on touchpoints</li><li> Take a holistic view of the customer experience, taking into account both companies</li><li> Listen to customers' concerns during the transition</li><li> Monitor the impact of the change on customers throughout the transition</li><li> Gauge the impact on the marketplace, in general</li><li> Understand customers' needs</li><li> Use the maps as a \"binding agent\" to bring the organizations together</li><li> Identify emerging trends, problems, etc.</li><li> Ensure no one or nothing falls through the cracks <br/>  </li><p> Benefits or outcomes for the business include:</p><li> Reduced churn/saved customers</li><li> Strengthened relationships</li><li> Possible new business from existing customers</li><li> Process improvements</li><li> New features/product enhancements</li><li> Subsequent messaging to the marketplace about the transition (through the eyes of customers)</li><li> Recommendations or referrals from existing customers <br/>  </li><p> The resultant company  can  be better for customers, as long as there is a concerted effort to make certain that is the ultimate outcome. <br/> <br/> The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance. -Alan Watts</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-29 18:00:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-29 18:00:35.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_zcPePlO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/binding-agent-for-mergers-and-acquisitions/\", \"post_id\": \"5074\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-29 18:00:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-29 18:00:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"binding-agent-for-mergers-and-acquisitions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5073\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2285\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438157500884-8425f0f9619b-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"330\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438256700,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2241,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Every Round of Funding Needs a New Pitch Deck","link":"why-every-round-of-funding-needs-a-new-pitch-deck","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Here&rsquo;s the thing about pitch decks. On the one hand, they&rsquo;re so easy to create &mdash; slides, pictures, bullet points &mdash; a trained chimp could do it. On the other hand, you don&rsquo;t score points from investors simply for getting the format correct. Your pitch deck&rsquo;s content  <u>  matters </u> ; it has to be exciting enough so that investors give you money.</p><p> The content of your pitch deck will depend on the stage of your startup. What you need to know is that  <strong>  every round of funding needs a new pitch deck. </strong></p><p> Why is that? Because your company is  <strong>  evolving as it grows. </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s changing so much that it&rsquo;s  almost  like you&rsquo;re running a new company with each funding round. Think about it. Since your last round, you&rsquo;ve probably hired key people, changed your product&rsquo;s features, changed how you deliver it, changed the pricing strategy, market strategy, the website and maybe&hellip; maybe&hellip; even the kind of beer kept in the company fridge!</p><p> OK, so that&rsquo;s the first thing.  <strong>  New round of funding = new pitch deck. </strong>  Your old slides are old news. We&rsquo;ll get to the content requirements for each round in a minute. But before that, l have to mention a few items that apply to all pitch decks, regardless of stage.</p><p> <strong>  Know your audience </strong> <br/> Your pitch deck has to speak to specific investors without deviating from the official story line. Do some recon work on the audience ahead of time. Take mental notes each time you present. Learn as you go. If you find one slide confuses or bores audience members, drop it. Replace the slide &mdash; if necessary &mdash; with one that&rsquo;s clearer, more vivid and urgent.  <strong>  A single friction-causing slide could send you home empty-handed. </strong></p><p> <strong>  No wasted pitches </strong> <br/> Practice  <u>  presenting </u>  your offer with your team. Don&rsquo;t &ldquo;practice&rdquo; with real-life investors. Instead, do it in front of the mirror, on video or in an unsuspecting department store, flashmob style. <strong>   The point is to hone your presentation until a) it&rsquo;s magnetic and b) you could run through it on autopilot. </strong></p><p> You will serve as the narrator of the pitch deck. Taken together, it&rsquo;s an interactive story. So watch your body language while presenting, don&rsquo;t rush the deck, and come prepared with answers to any questions.</p><p> <strong>  Pesky definitions of rounds </strong> <br/> OK, here we go. In today&rsquo;s overheated market, funding rounds have loose definitions. Basically, it all comes down to  <strong>  who </strong>  is doing the investing,  <strong>  how </strong>  much money they&rsquo;re putting up, and  <strong>  when </strong>  they&rsquo;re doing it in the life of the startup. Angel investor  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidsrose\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   David Ros  </a>  e </u> says,  &ldquo;An investment &rsquo;round&rsquo; is simply a set of one or more investments made into a particular company, by one or more investors on essentially similar terms, and at essentially the same time.&rdquo;</p><p> Here are the most common funding rounds explained and the appropriate deck for accompanying them:</p><p> <strong>  Pass the Hat Round </strong>  &mdash; this is the friends and family round; 98% of all startups go through it. Put it another way, any (unknown) founder who  <strong>  doesn&rsquo;t </strong>  raid his or her bank account and then hit up friends and family for money in the beginning will get the evil eye in later rounds. You gotta put your money where your mouth is.</p><p> Naturally, if you grew up in a po&rsquo; family on the wrong side of the tracks or still hang out with your loser friends from high school, then you probably can&rsquo;t rely on personal connections. But if that&rsquo;s not the case, and your Madre has money, she probably won&rsquo;t ask to see a 20-slide deck before making an investment decision. That&rsquo;s probably the case for Uncle Bill and Aunt Sally too, but be prepared with a pitch deck anyway.</p><p> <strong>  Accompanying pitch deck </strong>  &ndash; Highlight the dream. Get them excited about it. What you&rsquo;re trying to convey is the problem you see, the opportunity that exists, and why you&rsquo;re the person to solve the problem. At this point, you might have an MVP or not and in all likelihood don&rsquo;t have any KPIs or metrics to report.</p><p> <strong>  Key Slides </strong></p><li> Problem</li><li> Opportunity</li><li> MVP</li><li> Team <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Seed Round  </strong> &mdash; the first &ldquo;real&rdquo; round, once you&rsquo;ve tapped out your personal network. It&rsquo;s also called an angel round because the money ($250K &mdash; $3 Million) comes from &mdash; get this &mdash; angels. Angels are wealthy accredited individuals or pools of investors (angel funds). Funding in the seed stage can also come from incubators, accelerators, local  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marsdd.com/funding/embark-funding\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   governments programs  </a> </u>  and crowdfunding.</p><p> <u>  Angel investors </u>  are a diverse lot; you&rsquo;ve got the Angel of Death&hellip; Angel of the Morning&hellip; Snow Angels&hellip; etc. Some investors favor the angel role because they&rsquo;re teachers at heart and enjoy mentoring young entrepreneurs. Personal chemistry matters to them. Other angels are more passive, investing strictly for the potential payoff downstream. <br/> You&rsquo;re trading equity now. They give you money, you give them partial ownership in your company.</p><p> <strong>  Accompanying pitch deck:  </strong> although you have a product to show, this pitch deck is still idea-driven. It has to excite.  <strong>  You have to define the problem/opportunity, why it matters, and why you&rsquo;re the one to solve it. </strong>  You should have some users or customers by now. The data you are collecting from them should demonstrate traction, with one or two metrics trending in the right direction. You may not have any revenue yet, but you&rsquo;re heading there. You should know exactly what the money you&rsquo;re asking for will be spent on. Remember, the stronger the case you make for yourself, the less equity you&rsquo;ll have to give up.</p><p> <strong>  Key Slides </strong></p><li> Problem</li><li> Market Opportunity</li><li> Solution</li><li> Team <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Series A </strong>  &mdash; the first institutional round of funding. That means you&rsquo;re presenting to venture capitalist (VC) firms and trying to raise between $1 and $10 million dollars. Venture capitalists are looking for high growth companies with deep traction (e.g., GitHub, WayFair).</p><p> <strong>  Accompanying pitch deck: </strong>  your deck answers the money questions &mdash; or  <u>  <a href=\"http://reidhoffman.org/linkedin-pitch-to-greylock/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   investment thesis  </a> </u>  &mdash; first. Revenue and growth matter more than anything else. You also explain your marketing strategy and showcase how new money will help you scale up. Yes, your story still matters, but much less than it did in earlier rounds. VCs make decisions based on your product&rsquo;s defensibility, market penetration, and network effect.</p><p> <strong>  Key Slides </strong></p><li> Financials</li><li> Business Model</li><li> Growth Rate</li><li> Product <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Series B </strong>  &mdash; the second round of institutional funding. Venture capitalists want to see growth, preferably hypergrowth. You have a better chance of getting a check if your growth is outpacing projections from the last round (e.g., Groupon, Amazon).</p><p> <strong>  Accompanying pitch deck: </strong>  as Biggie put it back in the day, &ldquo;Mo&rsquo; money, Mo&rsquo; problems.&rdquo;  <strong>  You can&rsquo;t hide anything in your deck at this point, so if there is a weakness or vulnerability, address it head on.  </strong> The majority of Series B decks are data-driven,  <u>  showing key metrics </u> . Rarely at this stage could a company collect millions of dollars on a concept-drive pitch deck (but it did happen to the team at  <u>  <a href=\"http://reidhoffman.org/linkedin-pitch-to-greylock/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LinkedIn  </a> </u> ).</p><p> <strong>  Key Slides </strong></p><li> Metrics</li><li> Growth Rate</li><li> Product <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Series C </strong>  &mdash; the third round of institutional funding and yes, Series C have become common. Your ask will be in the tens of millions of dollars. At this point, you&rsquo;re probably asking for a cash infusion from prior investors. You have to show them how their initial investment has paid off thus far and why they&rsquo;d be FOOLS to stop feeding the fire!</p><p> <strong>  Accompanying pitch deck:  </strong> think BIG. Growth &mdash; Winning the Race &mdash; Top Dog &mdash; Winner Take All &mdash; Inevitable Household Name &mdash; Numero Uno &mdash; Breakout. If you&rsquo;ve gotten to Series C quickly, make that fact a key part of the deck. Show what you did with Series B funds and how more money will help you carry on until you&rsquo;ve achieved world domination.</p><p> <strong>  Key Metrics </strong></p><li> Growth Rate</li><li> Financials</li><li> Spend Rate <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Series D, E, F  </strong> &mdash; in the past, startups never got to this stage. They didn&rsquo;t have to. They&rsquo;d either go public (IPO) or get acquired. Today, companies can raise more from private sources than they could on the stock market, turning the funding game into alphabet soup.</p><p> <strong>  Accompanying pitch deck: </strong>  your deck has to show quantum growth, the right metrics, and how you&rsquo;ve become the #1 player in your space. You want to show investors that it&rsquo;s not TOO LATE to get on board and ride the gravy train of your awesomeness! You&rsquo;re heading for an exit in the next two years, and they can help make it a success.</p><p> <strong>  Key Slides </strong></p><li> Growth Rate</li><li> Financials</li><li> Competition</li><li> Exit Strategy <br/>  </li><p> Raising money is never an end to itself. It&rsquo;s a necessity to get you where you&rsquo;re going.

If needed, have an open dialogue to improve the situation and find out how you can help repair the working relationship.</p><p> <strong>  Be the manager who solicits input from each team member:  </strong> Be that manager that everyone seems to respect. Be the one who plays to people&rsquo;s strengths and solicits feedback and input. Once you have this information, don&rsquo;t just sit on it, create an open team forum where ideas are processed, input is acknowledged and problems are solved. A &ldquo;know it all&rdquo; &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; attitude will only isolate you and repel others.</p><p> <strong>  Spend some time: </strong>  getting to know the people who are reporting to you. Investing time and effort in relationship building is one of the most important things you can do. If you have genuine and productive relationships with people prior to the onset of a problem, you are more likely to be able to work through the problem effectively based on the history of trust and communication you have built.</p><p> <strong>  Give credit where credit is due:  </strong> As a rising star, you may have the temptation to prove yourself at every turn, inadvertently (or perhaps purposefully) stepping on others&rsquo; toes. This behavior is poison when it comes to your reputation and your ability to effectively lead, since it destroys trust, relationship building and collaborative work. Therefore, always give credit where credit is due. Acknowledge when someone has contributed an idea or identified a problem with a project or procedure and give that person public credit. Taking away someone else&rsquo;s thunder will only strike your credibility down.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t compensate: </strong>  for things you don&rsquo;t know. Just because you may not know how a procedure works or how a project is best completed does not mean you are a bad boss or not doing a good job. When we are promoted at young ages, it&rsquo;s often hard to admit when we don&rsquo;t know something. That is one of those skills that comes with maturity and making enough mistakes in life that you start to get comfortable with the fact that you aren&rsquo;t perfect. Because you don&rsquo;t know everything, it creates a wonderful opportunity for you to turn to others for help and advice. This does not undermine your leadership or power, rather it strengthens it. Remember, the greatest leaders of our time have always had advisors and have always had support.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-29 17:43:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-29 17:43:26.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_270obBC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/words-of-wisdom-to-a-gen-y-manager/\", \"post_id\": \"5070\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-29 17:43:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-29 17:43:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"words-of-wisdom-to-a-gen-y-manager\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5069\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2283\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAJpAAAAJGJlMGI5OTExLTY4ZmYtNDM0YS1hZDhhLWY2MWU0MmY5NWRiOA.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"370\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438275600,"author_id":156,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2238,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Create a Customer-Centric Advisory Practice?","link":"why-create-a-customer-centric-advisory-practice","source_link":null,"content":"<p>This revolutionary shift between the sellers and buyers of financial advice has taken place as barriers to access of financial information have fallen and the amount of choice in the marketplace has risen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These two factors mean that advisory practices that truly focus on their clients and work towards creating a customer-centric practice will position those practices to thrive and grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who don&rsquo;t &mdash; <strong> or who pay lip service to the idea of client-centricity </strong> &mdash; will be more vulnerable to the competition, including other RIA firms, robo advisors and hybrid robots.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the reasons behind this shift:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Access to information: </strong> Consumers no longer look to advisors, wirehouses and other financial services firms for information about investing and financial planning. Today, customers can find out information about just about any type of financial service or product and any advisor or firm, anywhere, anytime. That means the customer is more in control of the relationship, or potential relationship, with an advisor.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Era of choice: </strong> Customers no longer have to choose between Wirehouse 1, 2 or 3; instead, they have local options, which likely include wirehouses, RIAs, brokers, insurance agents and asset management companies as well as online options, which includes all of the above plus rob-advisors and hybrid robos.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>So what does that mean for you and your practice?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Access and choice translate into more control for clients. They aren&rsquo;t sitting around, waiting to hear from you to make a decision about their investments or their finances. Instead, clients and potential clients are searching for the information that appeals to them, when they want to, either at home or from anywhere with their mobile device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While an overload of choices and information can leave clients and potential clients feeling beleaguered and may ultimately translate into an individual client or potential client not taking action, the perception of access to information and choice has a powerful impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, clients and potential clients have more control and power over their investments and the relationships they enter into to help manage their investments and finances than ever before. While many may not realize this, more are, and are taking action as the universe of information and choices continues to expand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a continuing series about creating a customer-centric practice, I&rsquo;ll explore the implications around this trend and what you can do to make it work for you. Next up &mdash; understanding who your clients are and why that&rsquo;s important in creating a customer-centric advisory practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iris.xyz/advisor-tools/barriers-to-creating-an-integrated-customer-centric-advisory/\">Barriers to Creating an Integrated Customer-Centric Advisory</a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-29 17:26:07.000000","last_updated":"2021-01-20 20:24:02.701000","image_url":"2015/7/why-create-a-customer-centric-advisory-practice.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":"","white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"<p>Understanding who your clients are and why that&rsquo;s important in creating a customer-centric advisory practice. #financialadvisors</p>","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-create-a-customer-centric-advisory-practice/\", \"post_id\": \"5066\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-29 17:26:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-29 17:26:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-create-a-customer-centric-advisory-practice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5065\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2281\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438031167650-8d7a8f2ca96e-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"925\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":37567,"author_id":23,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2237,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Women and Divorce: How We Cope","link":"women-and-divorce-how-we-cope","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There is one universal truth when it comes to divorce&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard, really hard. How we deal with the struggle depends as much on the circumstances surrounding the split as on our individual emotional makeup. But one of the things that can help in understanding is that we&rsquo;re not alone in our experience. Although there are countless reasons why a couple may decide to end their marriage, there are a few divorce scenarios that most people fall into, each triggering a unique cascade of emotions. Below, I share three of the most common I see in my practice:</p><h3> The Blindside</h3><p> <br/> Meghan was in her late 30s and had two young children. She and her husband both had demanding jobs, but they still traveled and spent time together as a family. She believed her marriage was doing fine. But a year after their second child was born, she discovered her husband was having an affair. Despite the betrayal, she wanted to save the relationship. Meghan was a religious person and felt that divorce wasn&rsquo;t an option. Her husband didn&rsquo;t agree, and soon after told her he wanted to end their marriage. Her life turned upside down immediately, and she was overwhelmed with the number of changes she was experiencing. On top of losing her husband, she had to move and become the primary caretaker of her children. She experienced extreme anger and disappointment, intense sadness, betrayal, and of course, shock. She was forced to get a divorce that she did not want.</p><p> How we worked through it: Meghan had some family that she depended on, but she wasn&rsquo;t comfortable sharing a lot. She was embarrassed to be getting divorced with two young kids. The few friends she had were mostly married, which compounded her feelings of loneliness. Therapy gave her the space to grieve and figure out how she could have missed some of the signs&mdash;the late nights working and excessive drinking, the lack of interest in family time once their second child was born, the emotional distance between them (though she couldn&rsquo;t put her finger on), </p><p> and the decrease in their ability to communicate and discuss problems &ndash; that became apparent only after the divorce. It took many months, but Meghan eventually became more accepting of her situation and felt less guilty.</p><h3> The Slow Burn </h3><p> <br/> Melanie, age 52, had been married for more than 20 years and had three teenage children. After drifting apart for many years and not doing much to reconcile or resolve their issues, they ultimately divorced&mdash;at Melanie&rsquo;s request. Though still sad on some levels, she actually became happier as a result of her divorce and felt as if a weight had been lifted. She mourned the dreams she once shared with her ex, but eventually her &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; were replaced with &ldquo;what can I embrace now?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> How we worked through it: We first focused on addressing her feelings of guilt for leaving the marriage. By learning to accept her own role in its demise&mdash;including her lack of action to address underlying problems&mdash;she realized the decision to stay in an unhealthy marriage for so long was rooted in her childhood. Her parents didn&rsquo;t have a great marriage and often fought, but they reinforced the idea that you stay married no matter what. Melanie also started to spend individual time with each of her children to ensure they were doing ok and that their relationship continued&mdash;she encouraged them to do the same with their father. She and her husband decided to participate in a few co-parenting sessions so they had a safe place to discuss their differences and continue to put their children first. Over time, Melanie began to embrace her freedom, which gave her the opportunity to explore her individuality and the type of relationship she would like in the future.</p><h3> The Uncoupling</h3><p> <br/> Mark and Julie were married for 8 years. They had one child, age 6. What had started out as a close and intimate marriage morphed into more of a friendship and then simply roommates. Their disagreements about parenting, time with friends, work became contentious subjects and they just couldn&rsquo;t seem to find their way back. They just avoided any sign of conflict. As a result, they both started to &ldquo;uncouple&rdquo; and lead parallel lives while still raising their child. Mark spent more time with his friends and at work and Julie did the same. Julie finally decided to pull the trigger after a friend and family member made a few comments like: &lsquo;You guys don&rsquo;t do anything together anymore.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why are you still married? You seem so unhappy. I cannot remember the last time I saw you guys together and having fun. This got her thinking. Those questions forced her to take a big step back to see just how far they had grown apart. At first, Mark was shocked by her request, but he too, quickly realized neither had been invested for the last couple of years.</p><p> How we worked through it: Before they decided to divorce, Mark and Julie attended couples&rsquo; therapy to decide whether they could salvage what was left of their marriage. Together we explored their marital history and examined some of the issues that remained unresolved during their marriage. We also looked at how they started to separate and what they each believed drove them in this direction. With this information, I posed a few questions:</p><li> If you had to do it again, would you choose the same partner? Why or why not?</li><li> What does the answer say about moving forward to save the marriage?</li><li> What are some of the challenges in the marriage and are you willing to make the investment to overcome them and rebuild?</li><li> Are you willing to be really honest with your spouse about your feelings &ndash; not just about the problems but how you see the marriage long term? <br/>  </li><p> After a couple of months, it became clear to both of them that the marriage was over and neither wanted to put in the time or effort required to save it. Although this was a very difficult and sad decision for both of them, they each felt secure in their decision.</p><p> In some ways, Mark and Julie were lucky in that they could reach that point of security fairly quickly. For others, especially when the divorce is unwanted or accompanied by guilt for ending it, finding peace with your new life can take months and sometimes even years.

Take Inventory</h3><p> <br/> One of the first and most important steps is to determine where accounts are located and how they are registered.  If you are the executor/executrix this will help to determine if you have access to liquid assets so that you can pay any outstanding bills and taxes.</p><p> If you are not the executor, you would still like to know how the accounts are registered to assure they are handled in the most tax-efficient manner.</p><p> For assets in non-retirement accounts, assets receive a step-up in basis equal to the date of death value (or the alternate valuation date which is 6 months later, if elected by the executor).</p><h3> 2. Stretch your IRA withdrawals</h3><p> <br/> You discover you are the beneficiary on an IRA, so how will you be taxed? This is not an issue for spouses, as they can change the name of the Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and make it their own. But if you are a non-spouse beneficiary, you have several options, including withdrawing the money outright, withdrawing over 5 years or stretching withdrawals over your lifetime.</p><p> Your first move will be to set up an inherited IRA in your own name before making this decision.  Because any withdrawals from a traditional IRA will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, calculate your tax liability before acting.</p><p> If the deceased owner was already past the minimum distribution date (70 &frac12;), you can continue their distribution schedule or recalculate with your own life expectancy.  But if the owner was under 70 &frac12;, in addition to using your own life expectancy for the mandatory annual withdrawals required by the IRS, you can also choose to take the entire balance 5 years after the owner&rsquo;s death.</p><p> Consulting a financial planner will help you with the account set-up and appropriate distribution schedule.</p><h3> 3. Determine your Risk Preferences</h3><p> <br/> An important factor in the amount of risk in your investment strategy depends heavily on the direction of your cash flow.  Taking large withdrawals necessitates a lower stock allocation while saving, or not withdrawing funds, allows for a higher stock allocation.</p><p> The best way to determine how much you should have invested in stock investments is to complete a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/our-services/financial-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financial plan  </a> </u> .  The plan first helps you to determine a priority schedule in uses for the inheritance:</p><li> High-interest debt pay down</li><li> Savings (retirement and short-term)</li><li> Large extraordinary type of expenses <br/>  </li><p> After factoring in these objectives along with your income, you will have year by year targets for income, savings, debts and expenses.  With this information, and from conversations with your financial planner, we begin our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/our-services/investment-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   investment management service  </a> </u>  which helps to implement recommendations to reach the appropriate amount of risk for your situation.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-29 16:45:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-29 16:45:52.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Ypm7cgP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details/\", \"post_id\": \"5062\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-29 16:45:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-29 16:45:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5061\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2279\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_3412-2.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"659\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438261200,"author_id":100,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2233,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Salesforce: \"Let Me Explain to You How Our Organization Works\"","link":"salesforce-let-me-explain-to-you-how-our-organization-works","source_link":null,"content":"<p> ....that is the line that was shared with me verbatim today by an account executive of the leading CRM organization, <strong>  Salesforce. </strong></p><p> Here is the situation. I love Salesforce - not only are they the market leader, it's by far my favorite CRM and I not only use it for my own business, but also on behalf of all of my clients. I recommend it whenever clients are considering a change. If you aren&rsquo;t using Salesforce these days, you&rsquo;ll face additional challenges as so many of the apps are developed (and are being developed) for it.</p><h3> Sales Training or Intriguing Entertainers?</h3><p> <br/> Recently we were invited to their World Tour in New York. I happily attended the conference, not only to network, but also to find out what new developments might be a good addition for my business or for my clients. The sessions were good, so were the networking opportunities. During Happy Hour we were entertained by a scantily dressed female playing the violin (wonderfully), a great marketing accessory but, in my humble opinion, the money spent could have been allocated to sales training. In the end, every event is only as successful as revenues increase as a result. </p><p> Salesforce is undoubtedly a market leader &ndash; and herein lies a dangerous trap: To simply rely on your outstanding software/programming/product development/service/etc. alone and forget that you are actually selling to people.</p><p> So, getting back to the title, here is the essence of this blog (I'm sure you were wondering where this was heading).</p><h3> Even Warm Leads Need Work</h3><p> <br/> At the event we found out about a newly integrated Salesforce B2B marketing automation solution, Pardot, similar to our current solution. As I use Salesforce for my business, I thought I could consider their new software - integrating it with Salesforce would make more sense than two disjointed systems. We spoke to a specialist at the event who said she would have an &ldquo;Expert&rdquo; in our local area contact us.</p><p> After the event an Inside Sales person reached out and we had a 20 minute call. And we explained our situation, provided details on what we do (the sales person hadn't looked at our websites - what else is new?) and what we were looking for. This person was NOT an expert. And, he hadn&rsquo;t done any pre-call research, either.</p><p> The next step would be to speak to a &ldquo;real&rdquo; specialist - the Inside Sales person explained, referring to the internal workings of &ldquo;their process&rdquo;.</p><p> OK, we can do that. After all, we had been very specific about our situation and needs. We wanted to look into Salesforce Professional (an upgraded version), plus have a demo on their automated marketing software with a price quote. So, we scheduled a follow-up call for the next day with this &ldquo;specialist&rdquo;.</p><h3> When Your Service is a CRM System, Use It! Right?</h3><p> <br/> As we began our conference call the following day, it became clear that this so-called &ldquo;specialist&rdquo; had also NOT reviewed our website NOR did he check our status in their own CRM, didn&rsquo;t read the other salesperson&rsquo;s notes, and to top it off, was not aware that we are actually already an existing CUSTOMER!! Much to our astonishment and intense irritation.</p><p> Think about it &ndash; a company like Salesforce whose salespeople don&rsquo;t use their own tools!</p><p> He began asking us the exact same questions as the Inside Sales Person. We tried to stop him politely, to no avail. And then to add insult to injury, he kept talking over us, seemingly trying to disguise the fact that he was unprepared.</p><h3> Never, ever talk over people, especially not your prospects</h3><p> <br/> When I very impatiently (patience is not always my forte!) said that we had already shared our needs the day before, the account executive said. \"Let me explain to you how our organization works\".</p><p> Oh boy! I didn't reply in the way I was tempted to (&ldquo;I don't eff..ng care how your organization works&rdquo;), but, as politely as I could, said that I have neither time or interest finding out about their inner workings, and would rather spend the time seeing a Demo of their professional upgrade and marketing software to find out what the investment would be. Though, I had to literally shout over his &ldquo;waterfall of information&rdquo; to be heard!</p><p> Honestly, it sounds even more ridiculous now putting this on paper, but that's exactly what happened.</p><p> So, let&rsquo;s look at the phrase: \"Let me explain to you how our organization works\".</p><h3> What's More Effective? Good Sales Practices or Event Entertainment?</h3><p> <br/> This is truly only and I mean ONLY, warranted when you sit on the other side of the table. When you&rsquo;re the prospect - not the supplier. After all, as salespeople shouldn&rsquo;t we be more interested in how our prospect&rsquo;s organization works?</p><p> In closing, my recommendation to all salespeople, when developing new business is show interest in your prospect&rsquo;s inner workings, do your research, be prepared for that call and PLEASE, under no circumstances, not even when you work for Salesforce, please don&rsquo;t bore your prospects with details on why you are unprepared for a sales call.</p><p> So, I am asking you - <strong>  Do you think a company like Salesforce, the market leader in their space, could use Consultative Sales training or should they keep hiring sexy entertainers at their event? </strong></p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-29 14:46:25.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-29 14:46:25.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_sGvbp63.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/salesforce-let-me-explain-to-you-how-our-organization-works/\", \"post_id\": \"5056\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-29 14:46:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-29 14:46:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"salesforce-let-me-explain-to-you-how-our-organization-works\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5055\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2276\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-29-at-7.47.46-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"792\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438257600,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2232,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What About Naps?","link":"what-about-naps","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When I was growing up, naps were looked upon negatively.  In fact, many thought that naps were a sign of laziness.  Unfortunately, back then we did not understand the value of naps.  We were literally in the dark ages.</p><p> In recent years, we have come to appreciate the value of well-timed naps.  Numerous studies have shown that a well-timed nap can increase memory retention as well as athletic performance.  In fact, with their hectic travel schedules, many athletes routinely take short naps on game day.  Steve Nash, the great point guard, has touted the influence of naps on increasing his performance and longevity in the NBA.</p><p> We also know that naps improve memory retention.  This involves retention of facts as well as procedural memory.  The latter refers to things like riding a bike or your golf swing.</p><p> The first part of an average nap is dominated by non-REM sleep.  This type of sleep is mostly involved in factual memory.  If we extend the nap to 60 or 90 minutes, we get into REM sleep.  This portion of the sleep cycle is more involved in what we call procedural memory&ndash;what I previously referred to with the bicycle and golf reference.  However, we have to be aware that in some individuals, naps that are longer than one hour can leave one groggy and may make falling asleep that night more difficult.  So as with many things, it depends upon the individual.</p><p> As for short naps of no more than 30 minutes, that can go a long way in preventing the post lunch circadian dip.  You know that overwhelming sleepiness that is so common in the afternoon.  In fact, our neighbors to the south of us have taken napping to an art form.  They call it a siesta.</p><p> What have the studies shown?  A 10 to 20 minute nap in someone who slept a normal 7 to 8 hours the night before can increase alertness for four hours.  The same nap in someone who partied and slept far less than they should have, can increase alertness for two hours.</p><p> Therefore, what is the take-home message?  First, instead of reaching for the Starbucks, maybe a nap would be better.  Talk to your HR person or supervisor about putting into place a quiet and comfortable location where you and your coworkers can avail yourself of the opportunity to take a short midday nap.  Point out how it will result in increased productivity and a more harmonious workplace.  Unfortunately, excessive caffeine may keep people awake, but it can result in irritability and anxiety.

{"original_id":2231,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Microwaving Relationships: Building Influence within One High-Stakes Meeting","link":"microwaving-relationships-building-influence-within-one-high-stakes-meeting","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lizaheidelberg1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Liza Heidelberger  </u> </a> |   <a href=\"https://myleadersphere.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   myLeaderSphere  </u> </a> Leadership is most effectively done in the context of deep, meaningful relationships when you know that those with whom you work side-by-side have the same dreams and goals you do.  This type of &ldquo;relational equity&rdquo; is built over long periods of intentionally-planned time. But what happens when you know you&rsquo;ll be going into a highly emotional situation where opinions will differ and the stakes are high?   <strong>  How do you build influence within one high-stakes meeting when you&rsquo;ve never had a chance to first develop a relationship? </strong> During my years of consulting for special education teams, I was often put in this position.  Realistically, there are many situations where parents do not agree with teachers or principals, and the teachers and principals may not even agree themselves.  We&rsquo;re talking about children&rsquo;s futures here, so emotions would often run very high!  I would come in as a sort of middle man, gauging the situation and making suggestions for improvement or course of action.  In a majority of these instances, I would not have a developed relationship with one or more of the individuals involved.  Maybe I knew the special education teacher, but it was my first time working with the regular education teacher.  I had to learn quickly how to navigate emotionally-choppy waters while keeping the goal of the team out in front of us all.  Over time, I realized a sort of  <strong>  FORMULA FOR MICROWAVING RELATIONSHIPS: </strong></p><h3> 1) Start With The Heart</h3>The reason that a meeting is &ldquo;high-stakes&rdquo; is because varying parties are passionate about reaching the same goal, but have different points of view concerning how to achieve it.  But what is that goal?  What is the heart behind why the person you&rsquo;re meeting with feels so deeply about their position?  As soon as the conversation becomes tense, redirect it back to that goal, the heart, of the conversation.<h3> 2) Seek and Share Background Information</h3>What is the background knowledge of the person you&rsquo;re meeting with?  What are their experiences, strengths and skills that they can contribute to the conversation?  This is also a great time to insert your history, to build influence, but also to make connections with the person you&rsquo;re meeting with.  Any time you can make a connection with someone, and then point back to the heart of why you&rsquo;re meeting, it more closely aligns you as a team rather than as opponents.<h3> 3) Suggestions are Taken Seriously</h3>When you know you&rsquo;re going into a high-stakes meeting, it&rsquo;s natural to have planned out a list of points that need to be made or decisions that need to go in your favor.  Not everything that is suggested can be followed up on, but when you &ldquo;give&rdquo; in one area, you have a greater ability to &ldquo;take&rdquo; in another.  At the point where tough decisions are being made, take suggestions seriously and act on them quickly. Remember that this meeting is usually a starting point for future interactions.<h3> Valuing someone now can lead to a valuable relationship later.</h3><h3> 4) Show Genuine Concern</h3>Finish the meeting by sincerely asking, &ldquo;Aside from what we&rsquo;ve talked about already, what can I do to help you?&rdquo;  This is one more way to connect with the heart, and to show that you truly mean to serve and give your best for everyone involved.In the end, the goal of a high-stakes meeting needs to be for everyone to remember that it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;us vs. them&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;us working together&rdquo;.  Having an entire group of people working toward the same goal is much more effective&hellip; and much more fun!","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 19:42:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 19:42:51.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_q9wf5fd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/microwaving-relationships-building-influence-within-one-high-stakes-meeting/\", \"post_id\": \"5052\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 19:42:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 19:42:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"microwaving-relationships-building-influence-within-one-high-stakes-meeting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5051\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2274\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/meeting-720x340.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"560\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438166700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2230,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: 5 Ways to Overcome Client Procrastination","link":"advisors-5-ways-to-overcome-client-procrastination","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You&rsquo;ve just nailed your latest appointment. Your newest clients-in-waiting are on board. They see the value of the advice you&rsquo;re providing. They&rsquo;re clear on the costs and the process. Their financial problems are on the verge of being dealt with. All that remains is a spot of data gather, a few applications, a little bit elbow grease and they&rsquo;re on the way.</p><p> Days pass. You call. No response. An email. Same result. Another phone call goes to voicemail with no call back. Soon enough, weeks have passed and the client remains lodged in your pipeline like a barnacle on a boat.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve been caught in the Procrastination Zone.</p><p> Procrastination is yet another one of those issues that holds back not just advice businesses, but also clients. In many ways, it&rsquo;s a bit like paying bills. Many of us naturally hold off until the last minute before paying them, regardless of the fact we could do so earlier. Often we run the risk of missing the due date, incurring late fees in the process.</p><p> The same can be true of advice, the difference being that waiting too long to implement the right advice can mean missing the opportunity altogether.</p><p> From working with advice businesses, I&rsquo;ve found that getting on the front foot in addressing client procrastination is a good habit to adopt. It helps create better engagement, demonstrating to the client a mastery of &ldquo;getting it done&rdquo; and a deeper commitment to making sure they take real action that is in their best interests.</p><p> So, what practical steps can you take to help clients avoid putting off key decisions until tomorrow?</p><p> <strong>  1. Never end a meeting without asking &ldquo;What do I need to explain better?&rdquo; </strong>  In making a decision to engage your services, there are two factors that influence a person&rsquo;s decision. One is known as buyer acceptance, the other is buyer reluctance. Buyer acceptance is achieved by the client accepting the upside of what you have to offer and your ability to deliver. Buyer reluctance is about the client rationalising all the reasons that may exist that would stop them from engaging. Of the two, the latter is more powerful. If you don&rsquo;t address all those reasons in the clients head as to why they shouldn&rsquo;t pay your fees, take your advice and send back the information you ask for, there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;ll fall into procrastination. The solution is to make sure you are extracting via questioning all the things they don&rsquo;t really understand about what you&rsquo;re proposing but won&rsquo;t admit until skilfully prompted.</p><p> <strong>  2. Follow up within 24-48 hours. </strong>  Client enthusiasm for acting is never greater than the moment they walk out of meeting with you. Every moment that passes reduces their likelihood of acting. If you want to find the root cause of the reason why a client has been stuck in pipeline limbo for the past six months, it usually lies in what is done within the first 24-48 hours after meeting. A summary email, identifying specifically defined action items for both your business AND the client is a great way of turning a discussion into action.</p><p> <strong>  3. Ask for a preferred communication medium. </strong>  Some people live on email. Others never set foot near a computer but carry a smartphone with them everywhere. Many hate texting but will gladly answer a call. Some will answer a call but only at certain times. By taking time to inquire what might be the best way to get in contact, not only do you maximise your chances of choosing the right medium, but you also prime the client to expect contact.</p><p> <strong>  4. Ask for permission. </strong>  We all have the greatest of intentions. I don&rsquo;t purposefully ignore my accountants email asking me to get back some piece of information they need. In fact, I appreciate his persistence, but I end up feeling guilty about not coming back to him and so the procrastination cycle continues. A simple solution is to ask, &ldquo;Do I have your permission to keep following you up?&rdquo; By asking permission it transforms incessant pestering into a service provided with the purpose of achieving a commonly agreed objective.</p><p> <strong>  5. Talk about the effort required. </strong>  Behind the scenes of your business, a lot of stuff goes on that clients have absolutely no idea about. Sometimes they may even think that it&rsquo;s so simple that they can leave you to your own devices with no need for their input. This is a perception that can be addressed head on by talking to the client about the level of input required at each stage of the process. If there is clear understanding that you need a significant amount of their input early on, but not so much later on, it puts the emphasis on the need for them to act promptly when needed.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 19:37:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 19:37:21.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_5Bigijt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-5-ways-to-overcome-client-procrastination/\", \"post_id\": \"5050\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 19:37:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 19:37:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-5-ways-to-overcome-client-procrastination\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5049\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2273\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438016920686-9bccd253c785.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"477\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438170300,"author_id":456,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2229,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Social Security Benefit Update: Are You Leaving Money on the Table?","link":"social-security-benefit-update-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table","source_link":null,"content":"<p> At a recent conference, I asked a room full of successful professionals this question: &ldquo;Who here still has a personal pension plan?&rdquo; Three hands out of 50 went into the air.  <br/> <br/> My next question: &ldquo;Who here has a pension plan that provides monthly income as long as you live; adjusts for inflation; offers spousal, survivor, and divorced spouse benefits--and is guaranteed by the federal government?&rdquo; Even the three raised hands went down.  <br/> <br/> What I said next surprised everyone in the room: &ldquo;Every single hand in this room should be raised. Because every one is this room is entitled to Social Security benefits. Even more, when managed effectively, your Social Security could be your largest retirement asset, providing a level of income that may exceed your 401(k) plan and any other retirement savings you&rsquo;ve accumulated to date. For many, Social Security may offer $1 Million or more in lifetime income benefits.&rdquo;  <br/> <br/> That news surprised everyone in the room. If it surprises you as well, this fact may too: According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://nationalsocialsecurityassociation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   National Social Security Association, LLC  </a> </u> , over 90% of recipients leave money on the table when it comes to claiming Social Security benefits. In fact, many people receive tens of thousands--in some cases, even hundreds of thousands of dollars--less than they should over the course of their retirement. Here&rsquo;s why: </p><li> <strong>  Social Security rules are extremely complex. </strong> While most retirees adhere to the basic guidelines,  there are more than 2,700 rules governing Social Security . With so many rules--many of which are specific to very unique situations--it takes years of study to learn how and when to apply them. </li><li> <strong>  Misinformation is everywhere. </strong> While these rules can be navigated, they are often difficult to interpret. As a result, the media and even many professional advisors are misinformed about how to leverage Social Security rules to gain maximum benefits. </li><li> <strong>  Social Security personnel can&rsquo;t help. </strong> While it seems obvious that your local Social Security office would be the best place to get guidance, just as the IRS doesn&rsquo;t help with income tax preparation, Social Security staff is prohibited from offering planning advice regarding your benefits. </li><li> <strong>  Formal training in Social Security benefits is rare. </strong> Finding a qualified accountant to help decipher the tax codes is usually an easy task. Few advisors across the country, however, have received the in-depth training and passed the necessary exam to obtain a National Social Security Advisors (NSSA) designation. </li><p> <br/> <strong>  Rise above the confusion to boost your retirement income  </strong> <br/> <br/> Despite the obvious challenges, it is possible to maximize your benefits and claim your full benefit. While navigating all 2,728 rules requires the help of a trained professional, here are just a few that can have a significant impact on the amount you receive in retirement every month: </p><li> <strong>  Get guidance before claiming your benefits. </strong> Your initial social security income election is a  permanent election , which means even a small mistake could lock you out of a portion of your benefits--for life. The wrong election could potentially cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost income. </li><li> <strong>  File your claim at the optimal time. </strong> While benefits may be claimed as early as age 62, your benefits jump considerably by waiting until Full Retirement Age (FRA), which is 66 or 67 depending on your birth year. After FRA, your benefit increases by 8% plus cost of living adjustments (COLA) for every year you postpone distribution until age 70. This can mean an increase of as much as 76%, plus COLA, if you wait to receive benefits until age 70. </li><li> <strong>  When you do file, select the best possible option. </strong>  If you wait until FRA to file, there are options that can even further increase your income, depending on your specific situation. The two most common strategies are  <strong>  &ldquo;File and Suspend&rdquo; </strong> , which delays distribution so your benefits increase at 8% per year, but allows your spouse to begin receiving benefits immediately; and  <strong>  &ldquo;File and Restrict&rdquo; </strong> , which allows married or divorced individuals to restrict benefits to a &ldquo;spousal benefit&rdquo; amount and enable their own benefit amount to continue to grow at 8% per year. </li><li> <strong>  Take full advantage of spousal and dependent benefits. </strong>  Many people don&rsquo;t realize that Social Security benefits are available to the spouse and dependents of the claimant. Dependents 18 and under are eligible for as much as 50% of the claimant&rsquo;s benefits. Spousal benefits also typically equal about 50% of their partner&rsquo;s full benefit amount. But you must file a claim to receive these benefits. </li><li> <strong>  Widowed, divorced, or both? Don&rsquo;t miss out on available benefits. </strong>  If your spouse is deceased and you were married at least 9 months, you may file to receive full benefits (again, pay attention to timing and filing options to receive the maximum benefit). If you are divorced but had been  married for at least 10 years and divorced for at least two years  you may be eligible to claim benefits based on your ex-spouse&rsquo;s benefit amount, as long as you are not remarried. If you have married again, you are not eligible for ex-spouse benefits unless your later marriage ended in divorce or death of your spouse. Note, however, that if you remarry after age 60 and your ex- spouse dies, you are eligible for ex-spouse survivor benefits. </li><p> <br/> Of course, with thousands of Social Security rules to navigate, this is only the beginning. The important thing to understand is that leveraging the rules to your advantage can increase your retirement income for the rest of your life. With careful planning, a typical couple could receive more than $1 Million in combined Social Security benefits, far exceeding the average retirement savings of most Americans, as well as the expectations of most retirees.  <br/> <br/> So the next time someone asks if you have a personal pension plan, raise your hand high, and then put a plan in place to get that million dollars (or more) off the table and straight into your own pocket. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 19:31:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 19:31:42.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_WXBZ48U.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/social-security-benefit-update-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table/\", \"post_id\": \"5048\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 19:31:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 19:31:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"social-security-benefit-update-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5047\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2272\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2ff74bc.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1566\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438178400,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}

Online copy, after all, should attract your ideal clients to your business and make it easier for them to decide to buy your product or service.</p><p> Online copy is so important, in fact, that the way you write signals to your audience that you really understand who they are and what appeals to them.  If you sound like everyone else, you will lose your audience&rsquo;s attention. Think about it this way, a sales person sells to people 1:1, but your brand copy sells to hundreds and thousands at one time. Don&rsquo;t you want to make sure you get it right? If you don&rsquo;t, you could potentially be losing hundreds and thousands of new clients with poorly crafted content.</p><h3> Here are the seven deadly sins of corporate copywriting. Avoid them so that you don&rsquo;t lose potential opportunities: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. A Corporate Robot Tongue </h3><p> <br/> This is one of the most effective ways to lose a potential client. Instead of using corporate speak, what words, phrases and style do your clients use? Tap into their style so you can incorporate more of them into your brand&rsquo;s voice. If you need help in this area, consider sending your clients a simple open-ended survey asking them some questions about who they are and their experience with your product or service. Review their responses closely and incorporate their language into your copy. People trust the opinions of their peers and current users over a corporate mouthpiece. So leverage client testimonials when you can in your copy and use client stories to illustrate a value, benefit or usefulness.</p><h3> 2. A Focus on Features</h3><p> <br/> Hello. I think we all know in our heads that benefits are far more important to highlight in copy than features, but many of us still fail to put it to action. And the highly regulated industries of healthcare and financial services continue to be hog-tied by compliance that make it much more difficult to say anything that could even remotely resemble a promise. That being said, all industries need to find a way to talk benefits. Even compliance can&rsquo;t say boo about the benefits of your client service or personalized care.</p><h3> 3. The Preoccupation with Self Promotion</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t talk about yourself. Let me repeat: Don&rsquo;t talk about yourself! If your website sounds anything like, &ldquo;We are the leaders in&hellip;.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Our business is founded on the principles of&hellip;..&rdquo; STOP! I am already bored and so are your ideal clients. It&rsquo;s not that what you&rsquo;re saying isn&rsquo;t important; it&rsquo;s that everyone is saying it that way and you MUST sound different. Instead, talk about your clients and make them the focus of your copy and what they&rsquo;re looking for. If you&rsquo;re too busy promoting, you&rsquo;re not connecting with your audience.</p><h3> 4. Words That Lack Useful Purpose</h3><p> <br/> Since your copy should be about your ideal clients and not about you, are you providing value? Are you helping to answer a question or solve a problem with your copy? The answer needs to be yes. The more useful your copy, the more time an ideal client will spend with it and the more likely they are to share it with someone else. Usefulness leads to action, so be useful.</p><h3> 5. Long-Windedness</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s important that your content makes it point as quickly as possible. People just don&rsquo;t have the attention span to read tons and tons of tedious copy. Craft a killer headline that is specific and telling of the content beneath and then write as quickly as possible to get your main point across. Website content should not be a George R.R. Martin novel. Make it short and sweet.</p><h3> 6. Pages of Monologues &amp; Lectures</h3><p> <br/> Your copy is the opportunity to actually engage your online audience in a conversation with your content. Therefore, wherever you see the pronouns &ldquo;We&rdquo; and &ldquo;Our,&rdquo; strike them! Replace them with &ldquo;You&rdquo; as much as possible. Have a conversation with your target audience through copy, not an uninspired monologue about yourself &hellip; to yourself.</p><h3> 7. The Veil of Vagueness</h3><p> <br/> Good content is easy to read, easy to act, and easy to know to whom you are writing for. Great content also always answers, &ldquo;Why.&rdquo; For all the brands out there that are scared about getting specific about your target audience, don&rsquo;t be. Better to clearly identify your ideal client and attract more just like them than risk losing business that&rsquo;s not a good fit in the first place. Again, make it easy for people to get it and make sure you answer why you instead of someone else? Why now instead of later? Why this product or service over your others?</p><p> It&rsquo;s time all brands ditch the corporate robot and embrace the human. It&rsquo;s what makes each of us quintessentially unique and leads to some powerful and effective brand copy.</p><p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 19:27:03.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 19:27:03.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_ESFj9fy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-7-deadly-sins-of-corporate-copywriting/\", \"post_id\": \"5046\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 19:27:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 19:27:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-7-deadly-sins-of-corporate-copywriting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5045\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2271\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437915160026-6c59da36ede2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"798\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438169400,"author_id":311,"chart_url":""}

One of the many reasons this kind of marketing is effective today is because it is heavily data-driven. Whether you&rsquo;re piecing out how to write a blog headline or figuring out your response rate for social media engagement, numbers are always available to guide your decision-making and provide context for why you do what you do.<u> <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/online-marketing/email-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Email marketing </a></u> &mdash; the process of keeping touch, educating and converting leads through email campaigns &mdash; is no exception.

Using it effectively is another thing entirely. Here&rsquo;s a look at writing email marketing emails from the perspective of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud&rsquo;s <u> <a href=\"http://www.pardot.com/blog/the-2015-email-marketing-landscape/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  marketing report </a></u>:<li> Email content and design (79 percent), campaign management (74 percent), and contact management (74 percent) rank as the three most critical aspects of an email.</li><li> Marketers rank the 3 most effective aspects of an email as email content and design (66 percent), templates (59 percent), and quality control (58 percent).</li><li> MailChimp reports  <u>  <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-subject-line-comparison/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   straightforward, non-salesy email headlines  </a> </u>  outperform their opposites time after time.</li><li> MailChimp also reports that  <u>  <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/help/best-practices-for-email-subject-lines/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   short, descriptive headlines  </a> </u>  (under 50 characters) perform best overall and that list quality and list frequency can also play a major role in email marketing list performance.</li><li> Salesforce finds that a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.exacttarget.com/blog/50-email-marketing-tips-and-stats-for-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one-column layout  </a> </u>  works best in both aware and responsive design.</li><li> Finally, according to HubSpot,  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/how-long-should-my-email-be?__hstc=268771694.b3fc5611831d1ecfcca72d8aa6dad2b6.1427823328539.1437510704146.1438111047208.10&amp;__hssc=268771694.1.1438111047208&amp;__hsfp=2363212444\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   there&rsquo;s no perfect formula for email length  </a> </u> . It will vary according to your audience, the purpose of the email, and the kind of email it is.</li><h3> Statistics for Sending Email Marketing Emails</h3>Sending email marketing emails is another data-rich endeavor because email marketing clients have the capability to track and compare everything from send times to open rates. Here&rsquo;s a look at useful statistics for planning the launch of your campaign:<li> Newsletters (66 percent), promotional content (54 percent), and welcome series emails (42 percent) rank as the top three uses of emails.</li><li> Mobile opt-ins (76 percent), birthday emails (75 percent), and transactional emails (74 percent), on the other hand, rank as the most effective emails.</li><li> MailChimp data indicates that  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.mailchimp.com/insights-from-mailchimps-send-time-optimization-system/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   no single weekday  </a> </u>  is best for response and open rates.

{"original_id":2226,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Five Leadership Essentials Every Effective Leader Must Possess","link":"the-five-leadership-essentials-every-effective-leader-must-possess","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidpottruck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   David Pottruck  </a> </u>  </p><p> At a recent fireside chat, I was asked if leadership could be taught. I answered emphatically: YES!</p><p> Absolutely leadership can be taught, because there are so many different styles. There&rsquo;s the big personality, the kind that fills a room. They walk with this amazing air of self-confidence.</p><p> Then you have the humble &mdash; maybe even shy &mdash; authentic leader who people admire and believe in. They come from a place in their heart of gratitude, presenting a character that inspires everyone around them.</p><p> With so many styles, nobody is disqualified from being a leader. You just have to find your voice. Of course, other skills are required. Here are five leadership essentials, regardless of style.</p><h3> 1. Courage and prudent risk taking.</h3><p> There is no leadership without courage. You have to be willing to put yourself out there and take the blow. You need to take responsibility. You need to be willing to be held accountable. Even if it&rsquo;s not your fault, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. You also must be willing to walk the path less traveled, to try new things, to risk failure. And to bounce back when failures inevitably happen.</p><h3> 2. Authenticity.</h3><p> I believe my authenticity comes from my willingness to talk about all the things I&rsquo;ve failed at, and so I become more credible. My book, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stacking-Deck-Breakthrough-Change-Against/dp/1118966880/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436762385&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Stacking+the+Deck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stacking the Deck  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; is more believable because most of the stories are things that didn&rsquo;t go well, and how I learned from them. If I spent all of my time talking about my successes and saying how great I am, people would tune me out.</p><h3> 3. Communication.</h3><p> You must learn to communicate with empathy and humility. Fundamentally, this comes from actually being both empathetic and humble in your soul. It&rsquo;s a journey. It would be wise to seek out the mentorship of someone who has done it before you. Just make sure they&rsquo;ve done it well. I hired Terry Pearce to coach me and help me grow. It's been a long journey, and I am still 20+ years later a work in progress.</p><h3> 4. Listening.</h3><p> You need to be a great listener. It takes practice. You must get feedback. And then practice some more.</p><h3> 5. Earn a Following.</h3><p> You must be worthy of followership. Your title doesn&rsquo;t give that to you. Your position doesn&rsquo;t give that to you. It gives you authority, but it doesn&rsquo;t give you followership. You earn that from your character. A leader is nothing without followers and without a team of collaborators. Very few successes are crafted by a single leader. Certainly anything I have ever accomplished came from a team.

{"original_id":2225,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Deal with an Angry Employee","link":"how-to-deal-with-an-angry-employee","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It takes all kinds of people to work together to make a team perform at its best. Unfortunately, at times some of these people can be disgruntled, discouraged or overtly upset employees&ndash; either with you as the boss or with the company. It can take just a few people or at times even just one upset employee to derail a project or cause upheaval in your workplace. Hence, having a method of handling frustrations and a process for dealing with irate employees is essential for ensuring your workplace productivity and morale. </p><p> <strong>  Recognizing Signs and Behavior </strong> <br/> People who are upset can act out in a variety of ways. Some might come into your office and yell and curse, while others adopt a passive-aggressive stance and don&rsquo;t admit they are upset, but are not productive. Others can turn the anger or frustration internally and become depressed and function at a lower rate. As a leader, it&rsquo;s important both to recognize the signs of an employee&rsquo;s increasing anger and frustration as well as the subsequent behaviors he or she will exhibit and to know how to deal with that individual effectively. Telling someone who is yelling at you to &ldquo;just calm down&rdquo; for example, isn&rsquo;t going to work very well.</p><p> <strong>  Reasons for Anger in Employees </strong> <br/> Why do employees get angry in the first place? Let&rsquo;s first uncover some of the reasons behind this emotion.</p><p> <strong>  1) Perceived Inequality: </strong> <br/> Sometimes employees get angry because of perceived inequality. For example, an employee could perceive other employees as being less productive or effective but being rewarded or supported more often. This sense of inequality whether it is perceived or real, can lead to a lack of self-confidence as well as frustration and resentment against management that provides the rewards and support.</p><p> <strong>  2) Poor Fit for Tasks or Roles: </strong> <br/> Sometimes an employee gets upset because they are given tasks or a role in the company that they are ill-suited for. The introvert who gets stressed by interacting with people and who is asked to go sell for company may go do it, but stews inside at being asked to step so far out of his or her natural comfort zone.</p><p> <strong>  3) Being Targeted or Picked On: </strong> <br/> It is easy for people to annoy each other quite quickly. However, when employees purposefully irritate their colleagues for an extended period, talk down to them, or provide incorrect information, they may be sabotaging their colleagues. The employee who receives such subtle or overt negative behavior, will grow angry at being picked on or targeted.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  4) External Pressures: </strong> <br/> In other cases, an employee is undergoing personal issues and dealing with something outside of the workplace that impacts his or her attitude in the workplace attitude. Issues such as divorce, difficulty managing children, sickness in a child, parent, partner or family member can all become sources of stress that manifest into anger, particularly when the employee doesn&rsquo;t feel they are being supported by their boss or the workplace.</p><p> <strong>  Learn to Notice Behaviors </strong> <br/> These upset, frustrated and angry employees can come across in different ways. As a leader, you want to watch your employees for signs of changes in behavior. Does someone seem to sulk in meetings more often? Are they giving short clipped answers when they were formerly a talkative person? Are they responding to innocent questions with hostile answers? Most employees shift their behavior in subtle ways at first, and then more noticeably, if the behavior goes unchecked. As the leader, you want to be sure you are in touch with the behavior of your staff or encouraging your managers to know what&rsquo;s happening with each of their people. Anger that isn&rsquo;t noticed and addressed can turn into one of the dramatic cases where someone ends up getting hurt by the angry employee.</p><p> Once you have identified the shift in behavior, or you decide to address an employee who is constantly nasty or negative, there are a few things you want to do in order to deal with the person effectively:</p><li> Seek to understand.  A common response to negative employee behavior is to squash the angry behavior, but there can be many reasons why your employee is angry as outlined above. Many people have also never been taught to deal with uncomfortable or negative emotions. They don&rsquo;t know how to manage themselves and so they act out in ineffective ways. While you can&rsquo;t condone the negative, angry behavior in your workplace, you can first approach the employee with compassion and an observation that something must be wrong. You can start by saying something like, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not like you to be so sullen in our Monday meetings, Hugh. Is there anything going on that is impacting you negatively?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit concerned. I&rsquo;ve observed you speaking in a very angry tone to Stella, our receptionist, and she has mentioned being afraid to talk with you. Has Stella done something? Is there a problem we need to address?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important to get the dialogue going without being accusatory, but rather by uncovering the origin of the anger.</li><li> Identify specifically what the employee is doing. Don&rsquo;t just say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with the lousy attitude lately, Mark?&rdquo; Your definition of &ldquo;lousy attitude&rdquo; may be different from Mark&rsquo;s. Sometimes people know exactly what they are doing, but often they do not. Be clear and specific: &ldquo;I detect a negative undertone to a lot of your comments lately. For example, in today&rsquo;s meeting you said&hellip;&rdquo; Or &ldquo;The customer from the North End called and said you were behaving in an angry manner. She said you used four language when you couldn&rsquo;t get the computer to work. Is that true? What happened?&rdquo; The more specific and clear you can be in how you communicate, the better it will be for the employee to understand his or her behavior.</li><li> Deal directly with the employee.  Instead of discussing the issue at hand with colleagues to find out what&rsquo;s going on, deal directly with the employee. Too many times managers or business owners will ask around to try and learn information about the employee in question. They seek input from a friend or colleague of the person &ndash; something like, &ldquo;Hey, do you notice anything strange about Ed lately? What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; It can seem innocent, as if you are just trying to validate your interpretation by asking others, but it is very disruptive and hurtful to the employee you are querying about. If you want to know what&rsquo;s going on, go right to the source.</li><li> Model the behavior you want to see.  Many times people in charge don&rsquo;t realize the messages they are sending by the behavior they favor. If you tend to outbursts in meetings, speak harshly to employees when they do something wrong, or &ldquo;stew&rdquo; when you are upset about things going on in your company, your employees will get the message that this type of behavior is okay. They might even interpret it as the favored approach. Watch your own behavior, get feedback on it and see what your employees see. <br/>  </li><p> Most people don&rsquo;t learn how to handle their emotions, especially negative ones. It&rsquo;s very likely that at some point you will be faced with an employee whose behavior you reject. Try using one or more of these approaches and see if you can&rsquo;t turn their negative behavior into something more positive.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 19:07:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 19:07:23.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_uw6uMby.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-deal-with-an-angry-employee/\", \"post_id\": \"5040\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 19:07:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 19:07:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-deal-with-an-angry-employee\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5039\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2268\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAbrAAAAJGQzZTEzNGEzLWY3MDctNDZiMS1iMzBjLTYxMzI3ZDdiYTE1Mw.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"879\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438173000,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2224,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Ways to Avoid Being Judgmental Towards Employees","link":"7-ways-to-avoid-being-judgmental-towards-employees","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Performance reviews are a tricky business. They&rsquo;re intended as a judicious, constructive assessment of an employee&rsquo;s performance over time, but subjectivity gets in the way. A  <u>  <a href=\"https://resources.globoforce.com/globoforce-blog/infographic-the-startling-truth-about-performance-reviews\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Globoforce study  </a> </u>  found that 63% of employees believe that performance reviews aren&rsquo;t a true indicator of performance. If they&rsquo;re inaccurate, they&rsquo;re not helpful, which explains why so many of us dread them.</p><p> Much as we might try, it&rsquo;s impossible for managers to be fully objective. We&rsquo;re all biased. Call it human nature, but we just can&rsquo;t approach a performance review without bringing our own experiences, perceptions, and personalities to the table.</p><p> When it comes to delivering a successful review, a number of strategies can help you put biases on the back burner. Sure, you won&rsquo;t ever be able to achieve total objectivity, but you can approach the process with effective ways to combat your own subjectivity.</p><h3> Go Beyond the Personality</h3><p> Personality and performance are two very different ball games. Personality speaks to a person&rsquo;s characteristics and qualities, while performance speaks solely to outcomes and results. Don&rsquo;t conflate an employee&rsquo;s personality with their performance.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t like the way they&rsquo;ve approached a particular aspect of their job, ask yourself if there&rsquo;s a personality difference in play. Does the behavior you&rsquo;re seeing actually have a negative impact on their job performance, or is it just not what you would do? People handle situations and processes in a wide range of ways, but those differences aren&rsquo;t inherently bad.</p><h3> Go Beyond the Recent</h3><p> When putting together a review, it&rsquo;s natural for an employee&rsquo;s most recent behavior to stick out. Psychology calls this phenomenon the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100407678\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recency effect  </a> </u> , defined as \"the tendency to remember better information that was more recently learned.&rdquo;</p><p> If an employee fumbled a major project in the last month, that will overshadow a year&rsquo;s worth of stellar work. In order to get an accurate picture of their performance, you need to look at results pulled from a longer period of time.</p><h3> Go Beyond the Past</h3><p> There&rsquo;s a flipside to that last point. Focusing too much on job performance from ages ago can distort a performance review just as much as excessive focus on the recent. Performance often changes over time. If an employee demonstrated growth in particular over the last few weeks or months, that&rsquo;s the most relevant information. On the other hand, if they&rsquo;ve slipped in an area in which they&rsquo;ve historically performed well, don&rsquo;t look the other way. It shouldn&rsquo;t negate past strong performance, but it&rsquo;s still worth addressing.</p><h3> Go Beyond a Singular View</h3><p> In the sciences, reasonable conclusions come from collecting a range of data. The same principle applies to performance management. Seeking input from others helps tremendously in building a clear picture of an employee&rsquo;s successes and shortcomings.</p><p> Use peer reviews as a tool to inform your own assessments. Since they work side by side, peers have insights about each other that you may not miss. Even if you require just one peer review to accompany every performance review you give, letting another voice weigh in helps you see beyond your own biases.</p><h3> Go Beyond the Good Cop</h3><p> Excessively positive feedback inhibits a well-rounded assessment. It&rsquo;s more comfortable to focus on the positive while glossing over the negative in a performance review, but the manager who fears voicing criticism is an ineffective one. Without constructive criticism there can be no growth, so don&rsquo;t neglect to discuss areas that need improvement. The long-term payoff will far outweigh the discomfort of delivering negative feedback.</p><h3> Go Beyond the Bad Cap</h3><p> By the same token, an overwhelmingly negative performance review, even if it&rsquo;s all constructive, fosters discouragement, demoralization, and resentment. As an employee engagement survey conducted by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/press/employees-stay-longer-company-bosses-showed-appreciation-glassdoor-survey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Glassdoor  </a> </u>  revealed, 81% of employees are motivated to work hard when their boss shows appreciation for their work. A successful performance review delivers praise for what was done well, so don&rsquo;t neglect to give credit where it&rsquo;s due.</p><h3> Go Beyond Your Workplace</h3><p> In order to accurately gauge an employee&rsquo;s performance in their role, look outside your own workplace to find out what they should be aiming for. Job expectations make sense in a larger context. What are the required competencies for employees in comparable roles? What behaviors do successful employees exhibit, and how are those behaviors measured? A firm grasp on the industry landscape helps you create reasonable standards by which to measure your own employees&rsquo; success.</p><h3> Go Beyond Subjective Standards</h3><p> A sound performance review begins with setting up measurable standards. To successfully assess employee performance, you need to create questions that produce quantifiable, concrete answers. You can ask, &lsquo;&rsquo;Is Sally a problem solver?&rsquo;&rsquo; but to answer that you first need to ask, &lsquo;&rsquo;What are some ways in which Sally demonstrated the ability to problem solve?&rsquo;&rsquo; The former requires you to draw a subjective conclusion, whereas the second draws out examples to prove the same conclusion. Measurable standards encourage objectivity, making it easier to keep your biases in check.</p><p> With such a high percentage of employees believing that performance reviews are inaccurate, working on ways to improve accuracy contributes to satisfaction in the workplace. The  <u>  <a href=\"https://resources.globoforce.com/globoforce-blog/infographic-the-startling-truth-about-performance-reviews\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Globoforce study  </a> </u>  referenced above also found that employees who view reviews as inaccurate are twice as likely to be looking for new jobs. In the effort to invest in employee retention, providing accurate reviews becomes especially crucial. Thus, setting biases plays a role in long-term engagement.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 19:04:25.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 19:04:25.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_VrviDes.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-ways-to-avoid-being-judgmental-towards-employees/\", \"post_id\": \"5038\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 19:04:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 19:04:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-ways-to-avoid-being-judgmental-towards-employees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5037\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2267\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/80608146.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"987\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438182000,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

Instant gratification has become a cultural norm. But sometimes, waiting can provide greater satisfaction in the long run. For those of you (and/or your spouse) that are offered a Traditional and Roth 401(k) option through work, the decision on which plan to fund essentially comes down to whether you want the income tax benefit now or later. Specifically, does it make more sense to receive a tax deduction this year or tax-free income later? A quick summary of tax benefits and timing for each plan type follows.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"132\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-28-at-9.24.06-AM-2.png\" width=\"579\"/></p><p> <strong>  How to Choose? </strong>  If you believe that your tax bracket is higher now than it will be when you expect to withdraw the funds in retirement, then it likely makes more sense to take advantage of the current-year tax deduction you would get by contributing to a Traditional 401(k). If, on the other hand, you believe that your tax bracket is lower now than it will be when you plan to withdraw funds, then you might be better off funding a Roth 401(k).</p><p> It's also important to consider the value of an income tax deduction throughout your working years. Deductions become more valuable as your income goes up. If you are just starting out and believe your income is lower than what it will be in later years (insert prayer emoji here, flesh color of your choice) then the deduction may be more valuable in the future.

{"original_id":2222,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Enough About Passion: Let's Talk About Purpose!","link":"enough-about-passion-lets-talk-about-purpose","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  Dr. Heidi Maston </u></p><p> <strong>  Lately, every job post I read on LinkedIn, every college tip advice article I see, and every pop culture reference to the Millennials in the workplace seem to espouse the strength of finding passion. </strong> Passion, it appears, seems to be the hottest and coolest buzzword of 2015. Apparently all the trendy and cool kids are out chasing this golden Unicorn of immediate gratification and, dang Skippy, the dopamine rewards must be intoxicating! Find your passion, flash it around a bit, and light up the room: The world will be yours!</p><p> Except when it isn&rsquo;t. Except when you get tired of sustaining that energy level. Except when you lose focus. Except when maybe that wasn&rsquo;t your true passion and there is a messy breakup and tears. Those are powerful events that naturally occur when a person runs out of the highly addictive, romantic love and intimate love referred to as Eros by the Ancient Greeks. Eros can make you feel alive, initially, but it takes a lot more than an immediate pleasure hit to win the long race of success. There has to be more than passion, there has to be purpose.</p><p> It takes all forms of love to get you through the long nights of successful professional, and personal, development. These love stages include eros, storge, philia, and agape. For those of us who have long forgotten our Greek, let me provide a quick refresher compliments of our friends over at Wikipedia:</p><p> &ldquo;Eros (/ˈɪrɒs/ or /ˈɛrɒs/; Ancient Greek: ἔ&rho;&omega;&sigmaf; &eacute;rōs &ldquo;love&rdquo;) is is one of the four words in Ancient Greek which can be rendered into English as &ldquo;love&rdquo;. The other three are storge, philia and agape. Eros refers to &ldquo;intimate love&rdquo; or romantic love; storge to familial love; philia to friendship as a kind of love; and agape refers to &ldquo;selfless love&rdquo;, or &ldquo;charity&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Rather than burn out the flame of passion and console yourself with (yet again) another pint of ice cream therapy, how about committing to the long run through decisive action based on meaning? Let&rsquo;s talk about purpose. Purpose is defined by our friends at Thesaurus.com as: &ldquo;noun intention, meaning, aim.&rdquo; Some of its synonym friends include: &ldquo;ambition, desire, determination, function, goal, idea, intent, objective, plan, principle, project, reason, scheme, scope, target, view, wish, animus, bourn, calculation, design, destination, dream, drift, end, expectation, hope, mecca, mission, object, point, premeditation, proposal, proposition, prospect, resolve, will, big idea, intendment, ulterior motive, whatfor, where one&rsquo;s headed, whole idea, why and wherefore.&rdquo; This is a strong and powerful list of the entry points of purpose and what is just as interestingly ironic on the original site listed above, at no time is the word &ldquo;passion&rdquo; used. Not once, that I could find, did passion ever come close to dancing with purpose. Go check it out for yourself, I can wait.</p><h3> Illuminating, wasn&rsquo;t it?</h3><p> <br/> Setting aside the immediate gratification of passion, we find that there are three other types of love that lend themselves to developing and sustaining purpose. These are, as listed above, storge (familial love), philia (friendship love), and agape (selfless love and charity). As anyone who has experienced these forms of love can tell you, after the flash of eros, it takes the next level of personal commitment to keep the love alive! Why, then, do we tell people to seek passion and follow THAT?</p><p> Here is where it gets real.</p><p> It is easier to tell people to find their passion and send them on their way than it is to invest in the same person with time, resources, and real assistance in order to prepare them for the journey of a lifetime of purpose.</p><h3> Yes, we are the guilty ones. All of us.</h3><p> <br/> Why do we do this? When we innocently export our responsibility of engagement and we place the burden solely on the individual in front of us, we can comfortably extract ourselves from their potentially messy outcomes. In simpler terms, not only are we not obligated to invest in another person&rsquo;s time consuming development, we keep our hands clean, too. How many times have you heard (or said) this phrase, &ldquo;Go find your passion, Jimmy. When you find it and show measurable success, give me a call.&rdquo; This isn&rsquo;t good, kind, or helpful as it leaves &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; standing on the other side of the door wondering where to find said passion and guessing how to quantify it even if he did.</p><p> What is the difference between passion and purpose? Purpose, for the purpose of this article (ahem), is simply a process of identifying something an individual wants to change, grow, impact, investigate, etc. See the list above. Purpose is that moment when a person sees that thing they want to dance with, court, and enmesh themselves in. Purpose is that thing that makes a person want to know all about it examine it from all angles, and find a way to make it better. Purpose is agape love: selfless and of charity.</p><p> Purpose is what keeps us looking ahead to the potential of our tomorrow when the challenges become very, very hard rather than quitting because that passionate eros feedback isn&rsquo;t coming as strong as it once was.</p><h3> Purpose creates meaning: passion demands meaning.</h3><p> <br/> Please, with all due respect to those with the best intentions at heart, stop advising people to find their passion and help them identify, and pursue, their purpose. The world will thank you for it and so will all of the &ldquo;Jimmy&rsquo;s&rdquo; in your lobby, in fact they will love you for it!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 15:35:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 15:35:02.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_VOAzJcY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/enough-about-passion-lets-talk-about-purpose/\", \"post_id\": \"5033\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 15:35:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 15:35:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"enough-about-passion-lets-talk-about-purpose\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5032\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2265\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/iStock_000040022706_Medium-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"763\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438185600,"author_id":152,"chart_url":""}

If you are fine with losing your chance to retain the next generation after your current clients transfer their wealth, do nothing different.  You can count on 66% of your client&rsquo;s heirs taking their business elsewhere.  If you would like to change the odds for yourself, you need to do a lot more than &ldquo;get to know your client&rsquo;s family&rdquo;.</p><h3> That vague advice will not result in adult children of your current clients seeing you as a desirable person to trust.  </h3><p> <br/> If you want to establish relationships with the heirs, take the advice of those who have researched this problem of client flight and do more.</p><p> &ldquo;Bringing up wealth transfer with clients shows them you care about the future success of their children; it can be a huge differentiator,&rdquo; said Diane Doolin, an adviser with Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, speaking to Investment News. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about advisers losing assets when the clients die, it&rsquo;s about taking the current relationships to a deeper level.&rdquo;</p><p> As we see it at  <a href=\"https://aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   AgingInvestor.com  </u>  , </a>  having a plan to prepare your client&rsquo;s heirs for wealth transfer is an essential ingredient in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/webinars/#iwtransfers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   successful transfers  </a> </u> .  That means that you will have to spend time with your client to develop understanding of their plan for  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/webinars/#iwtransfers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wealth transfer  </a> </u> . Who are the heirs?  Where are they? Are both your client and the heirs willing to meet to discuss the plan for the future and to learn how to become good stewards of the wealth?</p><p> Once you learn who the players are and determine that your client is willing to put time into their potential success with the inheritance,  you will need to establish a method for the heirs&rsquo; education.  This is not a simple, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/webinars/#iwt_meetings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   have a couple of family meetings  </a> </u> &rdquo; approach. Rather, we advocate a thorough, hands on, goal-specific series of meetings with the intended recipients of their parents&rsquo; wealth to teach them how to best handle every part of that legacy. This includes the parts of the estate that the advisor does not personally manage. That may include the family business, real estate investments, and other holdings.</p><p> The advisor has the opportunity to take a leadership role in bringing the family&rsquo;s existing managers and experts into the conversations.  If the family doesn&rsquo;t have enough capable teachers among those managers, develop some experts of your own in these fields, people you can trust to offer the needed guidance to help heirs. Any heir who understands the complexity of the wealth she will be obligated to manage after it changes hands has an improved chance of maintaining or growing that wealth.  You, as the advisor can play a key role as leader and facilitator.</p><h3> If this sounds like a big and time consuming venture, it is.  </h3><p> <br/> Depending on how much is at stake, it will be well worth it to establish yourself as a leader and resource for the family so that they can learn how to best preserve and wisely use what their elders have created.</p><p> As Williams and Preisser have concluded after researching wealth transfers among thousands of families, the family fortune is lost by the heirs 70% of the time with the first wealth transfer and 90% of the time by the second generation transfer.  If you want your client&rsquo;s family to succeed and they want to succeed also, you have a golden opportunity to be a prime mover in educating these heirs.</p><p> Being an advisor to your client is one thing. Bringing the children and grandchildren into the conversations about how to handle and preserve wealth is another.  If you want to play a prominent role in leading the way to the family&rsquo;s understanding of their assets and responsibilities, you can.  Not every client will be willing. But for those who accept your leadership, you have a chance to establish yourself as an important and critical player in bringing about a successful wealth transfer plan and at the same time, you maximize your relationship with the heirs.</p><p> That relationship gives you the best chance to keep the next generation of clients.  Remember that most of your clients&rsquo; heirs who do not want you to continue to manage the assets after your client passes will leave you because they don&rsquo;t have a relationship with you. They want to work with someone they know and trust.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 15:23:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 15:23:55.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Wfyx13u.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-will-you-get-fired-by-your-clients-adult-kids/\", \"post_id\": \"5031\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 15:23:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 15:23:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-will-you-get-fired-by-your-clients-adult-kids\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5030\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2264\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438012940875-4bf705025a8a-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"595\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438167600,"author_id":155,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2220,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Reasons Why Gold Isn't Behaving Like Gold Right Now","link":"3-reasons-why-gold-isnt-behaving-like-gold-right-now","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As many of you know, I was in San Francisco the week before last where I had been invited to speak at the MoneyShow, one of the biggest, most preeminent investor conferences in the world. Over the past couple of decades, I&rsquo;ve spoken at many MoneyShows all around the country and have covered many different topics. Gold investing is one that often draws a big crowd. Not this year. Guess which natural resource stole the show?</p><p> The commodity that attracted attendees&rsquo; attention is one that until pretty recently could only be grown and harvested under the shroud of secrecy. Marijuana. Currently legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia, medical marijuana generated $2.7 billion in 2014 and is expected to bring in $3.4 billion this year. Investors are taking notice. The cash crop is even starting to change intranational migration. Whereas many retired seniors flock to warmer climates in which to live out their golden years, others now factor in whether a state will permit them to self-medicate in order to treat their arthritis, according to a recent Time article.</p><p> Investors themselves who might have suffered from arthritis attended the pot presentation at their own risk, as it was standing room only. They couldn&rsquo;t have been pulled away even to sit comfortably in the scarcely occupied room next door. Sentiment toward gold was indeed very bearish at the MoneyShow, as it is around the world right now.</p><h3> Gold Hits the Reset Button</h3><p> <br/> Gold is universally recognized as a safe-haven investment, a go-to asset class when others look uncertain. Following the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, the metal&rsquo;s price surged, eventually topping out at $1,900 per ounce in August 2011.</p><p> But last week proved to be a particularly rocky one for the metal, even with Greece and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/does-your-muni-bond-fund-own-puerto-rico-bad-debt/#.VbJrTP50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Puerto Rico&rsquo;s debt dilemmas  </a> </u> , not to mention the recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/chinas-market-correction-in-three-easy-charts/#.VbJra_50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Shanghai stock market  </a> </u>  decline, fresh in investors&rsquo; minds. Gold traded down for 10 straight sessions to end the week at $1,099 per ounce, its lowest point in more than five years. Commodities in general dropped to a 13-year low.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-24/COMM-Commodities-Drop-to-a-13-Year-Low-07242015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Commodities-Drop-to-a-13-Year-Low\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-24/COMM-Commodities-Drop-to-a-13-Year-Low-07242015.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> Gold stocks, as expressed by the XAU, also tumbled.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-24/COMM-gold-stocks-slide-to-a-multi-year-low-07242015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"gold-stocks-slide-to-a-multi-year-low\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-24/COMM-gold-stocks-slide-to-a-multi-year-low-07242015.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> The selloff was given a huge push when China, for the first time in six years, revealed the amount of gold its central bank holds. Although the number jumped nearly 60 percent since 2009 to 1,658 tonnes, markets were underwhelmed, as they had expected to see double the amount.</p><p> Then in the early hours last Monday, gold experienced a &ldquo;mini flash-crash&rdquo; after five tonnes appeared on the Asian market. Initially this might not sound like a lot, but five tonnes equates to 176,370 ounces, or about $2.7 billion. It also represents about a fifth of a normal day&rsquo;s trading volume. Suffice it to say, price discovery was effectively disrupted. In a matter of seconds, gold fell 4 percent before bouncing back somewhat.</p><p> Reflecting on the trading session, widely-respected market analyst Keith Fitz-Gerald noted: &ldquo;Far from being a one-day crash, this could represent one of the best gold-buying opportunities of the year.&rdquo;</p><p> The last time the metal descended this quickly was 18 months ago, on January 6, 2014, when someone brought a massive gold sell order on the market before retracting it in a high-frequency trading tactic called &ldquo;quote stuffing.&rdquo; Last month I shared with you that we now know  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/theree28099s-a-huge-disparity-between-how-regulators-deal-with-gold-and-stock-market-manipulation/#.VbJJR_50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   who might have been responsible  </a> </u>  for the action&mdash;and many others that preceded it&mdash;and pointed out that the accused party&rsquo;s penalty of $200,000 was grossly inadequate. Last Monday I told Daniela Cambone during the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/in-the-news/frank-holmes-golds-selloff-is-a-great-short-term-opportunity/#.VbJi7v50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gold Game Film  </a> </u>  that such downward price manipulation seems to result in little more than a slap on the wrist. But if manipulation is done on the upside, traders could get into serious trouble.</p><p> Besides apparent price manipulation, other factors are affecting gold&rsquo;s behavior right now, three in particular.</p><h3> 1. Strong U.S. Dollar</h3><p> <br/> Like crude oil, gold around the world is priced in U.S. dollars. This means that when the greenback gains in strength, the yellow metal becomes more expensive for overseas buyers. With the U.S. economy on the mend after the recession, the dollar index remains steady at a 12-year high.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to recognize, though, that gold is still strong in other world currencies, including the Canadian dollar. As such, our precious metals funds have hedged Canadian dollar exposure for Canadian gold stocks, which has benefited our overall performance.</p><h3> 2. Interest Rates on the Rise?</h3><p> <br/> Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen continues to hint that interest rates might be hiked sometime this year, perhaps even as early as September. When rates move higher, non-yielding assets such as gold often take a hit.</p><p> As you can see, the 10-year Treasury bond yield and gold have an inverse relationship.

The conversations were going so well that, even though I love consulting full time, I found myself drawn to the challenge. And the CEO was interested enough in my background and what I could bring to the table that she was offering to make arrangements that would allow me to continue to service my independent clients. It sounded like my perfect dream job.</p><h3> But then the unexpected happened.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve always believed in interviewing a potential employer as carefully as they interview me. As a consultant, the &ldquo;fit&rdquo; is critical&mdash;I want to be certain I can deliver true value, not just close the business. As a potential full-time employee, that fit is even more important. If I&rsquo;m going to spend most of my waking hours collaborating with a team, I want to be sure there&rsquo;s synergy on every level, and that I&rsquo;ll have the support I need to apply my skills, deliver what&rsquo;s needed and, hopefully, take the challenge beyond what was ever expected.</p><p> At this particular company, I thought that&rsquo;s exactly where I was headed. The CEO seemed to have a strong vision. The executive team was energetic and seemed cohesive in their outlook for the future. But something was amiss. Outside the executive offices, there seemed to be tension.</p><p> Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t jump right in. I asked if I could meet privately with a few of the employees who would be on my team if I agreed to take the helm. I began to interview the company&rsquo;s people in earnest. And that&rsquo;s when the truth came out. The words I heard made me run&mdash;not walk&mdash;from the building, and never come back.</p><h3> The words that made me run from the building.</h3><p> <br/> First, I asked the head of development what his biggest challenge was each day. Honestly. Here&rsquo;s what he said:</p><p> &ldquo;Every day, I come in knowing what I need to accomplish. And every day when I walk in that door, I&rsquo;m given a completely new task&mdash;one that is absolutely impossible. And I&rsquo;m told it needs to be done by the end of the day.&rdquo; He stopped for a moment and looked at me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being told I need to move this eight-story building four inches to the left. By 6:00 p.m.&rdquo; He stopped again, and the look on his face was pure frustration. &ldquo;Four inches to the left. Not only can&rsquo;t it be done, but the building is fine right where it is.&rdquo;</p><p> With that theme in mind, I talked to four more people. They all had the same story. There was lots of drive, but no consistent vision. Every day, someone would come in with a new idea based on something they&rsquo;d read in  <u>  <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/\" target=\"_blank\">   The Wall Street Journal  </a> </u>  or heard on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MSNBC  </a> </u> . And every day they were certain this new idea would be the key to making the new company the next Wall Street darling. I ran out the door and never looked back.</p><h3> When it&rsquo;s right, you&rsquo;ll know it.</h3><p> <br/> I made that decision to walk away as easily as I made one to join a little company called  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manugistics\" target=\"_blank\">   Manugistics  </a> </u> &mdash;back before the company was a Wall Street darling. I had just moved to Washington D.C. from Los Angeles. Accenture wanted to keep me. KPMG was courting me. But I interviewed for a job at this small, 300-employee, family-owned business in Rockville, MD. And the first thing I noticed as I sat in the lobby that morning was that everyone coming in the door looked happy. Excited. Joyful. They were there because they wanted to be. There was vision. There was team collaboration. As a result, I found a dream job, and what followed was great success.</p><p> And while this won&rsquo;t surprise anyone, I haven&rsquo;t heard a word about that little startup in California since I bolted from the lobby&mdash;on Wall Street or otherwise. I can only hope the employees I spoke with ran as fast as I did and, with a little luck and persistence, found shiny new jobs that were, in fact, their dream jobs.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 13:55:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 13:55:34.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_bknCzE6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-know-when-that-shiny-new-job-is-not-your-dream-job/\", \"post_id\": \"5027\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 13:55:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 13:55:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-know-when-that-shiny-new-job-is-not-your-dream-job\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5026\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2262\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1438026979266-4918f93a4006-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"746\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438189200,"author_id":89,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2218,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"9 Things I Tell My Little League Player About Baseball That Are True About Life","link":"9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My son started playing little league baseball this year and it&rsquo;s been a learning experience &ndash; for both of us.</p><p> We started throwing a baseball a few years ago, but he never played seriously. Then last summer I realized that he had developed quite an arm. This season, he started playing Little League ball.</p><p> Baseball has been a favourite pastime for generations. I never played baseball myself (well, I played some softball) and I was a on (early 1990s Blue Jays) and off (ever since then) fan over the years. But as my son gets into the game more, it&rsquo;s starting to grow on me again.</p><p> Baseball, like many minor league sports, is a metaphor for life. How we deal with baseball is a reflection on how we deal with ourselves, our success and failure, our teammates, our role as team players, pressure and stress, etc. The game is a remarkable combination of mental alertness AND physical ability. The whole gamut of life&rsquo;s challenges is encapsulated in baseball.</p><p> Take the concept of making mistakes. No one likes to make mistakes, but my son is right up there among the perfectionists. He HATES to make mistakes &ndash; not unlike his father, it should be pointed out.</p><h3> Baseball is all about the errors&hellip;and how you recover</h3><p> <br/> And yet, baseball is all about mistakes &ndash; fielding errors, strike-outs, pop flies, walked batters, bad throws, etc. In fact, mistakes happen more often than not in baseball. Good batters only hit the ball 3 or 4 times out of 10, which means the other 6 or 7 times they are failing to hit the ball.</p><p> How we learn to manage mistakes and failure in life is often the key to our success &ndash; and it&rsquo;s most certainly the key to success in baseball.</p><p> Here are a few things I would find myself saying to my son about baseball that would apply to life:</p><h3> 1. Everyone makes mistakes. </h3><p> EVERYONE. Sometimes, the winning team is the team that makes a few less mistakes. Even ONE less mistake. A winner is just a loser that tried again.</p><h3> 2. A winning team has (at least) nine players. </h3><p> While some positions are more glamorous and get more attention in baseball (eg., pitching or catching), successful teams require each player to play their position well. Even if you&rsquo;re sitting out in left field and you get one or two hits to field in a game, playing that position as well as you can is the first and most important way you can support your team. This goes for every team in every endeavor.</p><h3> 3. We need to learn from our mistakes. </h3><p> In fact, that&rsquo;s how we learn everything. We try and fail, then make corrections until we succeed. It can be frustrating and painful at times, but I am not aware of any other way to become really good at something without making lots of mistakes.</p><h3> 4. Some people make more mistakes than others. </h3><p> We are all on a different path of learning. Some guys can really hit, but can&rsquo;t throw or are not smart on the base path. Other guys can&rsquo;t hit well, but they get walked a lot and are smart on the bases and score runs. We need to support our teammates and help them to do better in the areas where they need help.</p><h3> 5. We can learn from our teammates. </h3><p> As a corollary to the previous point, we all have strengths and weaknesses. Working as a team means learning from those that are better at certain things, while helping those that need it. Ask the guy who&rsquo;s a great hitter for some tips, then offer the guys who&rsquo;s afraid of the ball some support.</p><h3> 6. Don&rsquo;t get down on yourself. </h3><p> It&rsquo;s normal to feel frustrated with yourself for making a mistake and letting your team down, but don&rsquo;t get down on yourself. Holding yourself to a high expectation of performance is good, but you need to learn how to transform this emotion into productive energy and move forward.</p><h3> 7. Recover quickly from your mistakes. </h3><p> Often, what you do right after you make a mistake on the field is more important than the mistake itself. You bobble a ball, but you recover quickly and pick up the ball and throw the guy out. Or you swing on a terrible third strike pitch, but the catcher drops it so you alertly run down to first. Sometimes, we just need to let go of our mistakes and move on &ndash; to the moment, the next pitch, the next at bat, the next game, the next season.</p><h3> 8. Games are supposed to be fun. </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re not having fun, you&rsquo;re doing something wrong. Figure out how to make whatever you do more fun and chances are you&rsquo;ll do better at it. This is a life lesson, if ever there was one.</p><h3> 9. It&rsquo;s just a game. </h3><p> It&rsquo;s important and it matters in a certain context (i.e., it matters in the game itself). But in the bigger picture, it&rsquo;s just a game. It&rsquo;s just a project. It&rsquo;s just a business deal. It&rsquo;s just whatever. If you&rsquo;re truly fortunate, you have your health, you&rsquo;ll come home to a good meal with friends and/or family and you&rsquo;ll live in a peaceful country full of opportunity. Have some perspective.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-28 01:37:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-28 01:37:09.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_oAsrRvF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"post_id\": \"5025\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-28 01:37:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-28 01:37:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5024\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2261\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-6.36.24-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"557\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/07/9-things-i-tell-my-little-league-player-about-baseball-that-are-true-about-life/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438196400,"author_id":219,"chart_url":""}

In the long run, we shape our lives and we shape ourselves. The process never ends until we die. And, the choices we make are ultimately our own responsibility.</p><p> &ndash; Eleanor Roosevelt</p><p> There&rsquo;s quite a lot of talk these days about the importance of knowing your &ldquo;leadership philosophy&rdquo;. What are your core values? Your guiding principles? Your beliefs? Your purpose? Incredibly important stuff. And yet a &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; alone, in my humble opinion, falls short.  How many people do you know who believe one thing and yet behave contrary to their beliefs?</p><h3> How many people do you know who  believe  one thing and yet  behave  contrary to their beliefs? <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s easy to  believe  in positive reinforcement &ndash; until someone&rsquo;s not hitting their numbers.  It&rsquo;s admirable to  believe  in open communication &ndash; until you have to say something that&rsquo;s uncomfortable.  It&rsquo;s one thing to  believe  that all people are worthy of respect and dignity, and yet quite another thing to  champion  respect and dignity for all.</p><p> To believe requires nothing of you. You can sit and believe.  And believe. And believe.  And that changes nothing.  There is no impact.</p><h3> To believe requires nothing of you. You can sit and believe and that changes nothing.   <br/>  </h3><p> To actually champion requires you to put yourself out there. To fight for what&rsquo;s right. To question. To look deeply. To seek alternatives. To bring people together. To bridge differences. To explore. To intervene.  To shake things up. To push ahead. To shatter perspectives. To heal. To poke holes. To lighten up. To celebrate. To tolerate. To expand. To forgive. To invite. To act. It requires you to act. You cannot champion from the sidelines.  You cannot champion without taking action.</p><p> Excavating your leadership philosophy is a critical first step &ndash; it is the process that allows you to get clear about your thinking and begin the process of uncovering internal need &ndash; the thing that drives you.  But powerful leadership requires more than understanding yourself. It requires not just identifying, but committing to the authentic, constructive actions that fall out of internal need.  Which takes something.</p><p> In the theatre world, the thing that gives an actor a sense of presence &ndash; that intangible magic that makes you hang on every word and completely believe that a character is real &ndash; is the actor&rsquo;s commitment to two things: honesty and action.</p><p> <strong>  Honesty: </strong> Actors (or rather good actors) are relentless truth seekers. They are continually challenged to understand themselves &ndash; to tell themselves the truth about their deepest motivations, greatest fears, and driving needs &ndash; and about  <u>  <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/blog/2015/05/26/whats-your-mess-to-own-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   how honestly they&rsquo;re showing up  </a> </u> . They own when they&rsquo;re not being real. They own, when they&rsquo;ve made a bad choice. They don&rsquo;t hide it &ndash; they own it. They stay curious about themselves &ndash; recognizing that understanding is always evolving.  <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/blog/2015/06/15/need-permission-to-be-imperfect-here-it-is-my-imperfect-tedx-talk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   They&rsquo;re honest with themselves  </u>  . </a></p><p> They&rsquo;re also honest in their interactions with others. They reach inside and, with great courage, have the vulnerability to take down their mask and allow themselves to be seen. Really seen. Honestly.</p><h3> How honest are you with yourself about yourself? How honestly do you allow yourself to show up with others? <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Action: </strong> A good actor is always focused on doing what it takes to overcome the obstacles in their path and achieve what their character wants most &ndash; what we call their Super Objective. A Super Objective is active &ndash; and it&rsquo;s communicated in active language.  To champion.  To build up.  To engage.  To rally.  Active verbs that set you on an active path and require action.  You cannot achieve a Super Objective by simply believing or thinking &ndash; you must DO.  Actors who are too much in their head or who are just saying the words but not  <u>  <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/blog/2015/04/20/commitment-without-guarantees-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   committed 100%  </a> </u>  to the actions they&rsquo;re taking, are boring to watch &ndash; they have no presence (and thus they&rsquo;re typically unemployed). Leaders, whose words and beliefs aren&rsquo;t manifesting themselves in consistent and constructive action, aren&rsquo;t trusted. The people around them hold their best effort back. They don&rsquo;t put themselves on the line. They won&rsquo;t be honest. They&rsquo;re not loyal. They keep their passion, energy, excitement, ideas, and commitment locked away inside.</p><h3> Are your actions truly consistent with your words and beliefs? <br/>  </h3><p> A clear leadership philosophy is a good start but you&rsquo;ve got to get it out of your head and have it show up in your actions or it does you no good.  The people you lead need you to be and bring your best real self &ndash; what I call brave &ndash; to your leadership game.  You are here to make an active difference.</p><p> As I asked in  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgCBVGBHGx4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   my recent Tedx talk  </a> </u> , what is the impact you are here to have?

{"original_id":2215,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Get a Standing Ovation","link":"how-to-get-a-standing-ovation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> From <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Science of People  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  Oh, the Standing O. It&rsquo;s coveted by speakers. It&rsquo;s hoped for by audiences. It&rsquo;s the ultimate reward for a speech well-given. </strong></p><p> Why is that some speakers can move us so deeply that we stand to our feet in triumph? Here at the Science of People we study the hidden forces that drive our behavior. We love looking for patterns to hard questions. And the science and psychology of a standing ovation is certainly one of them.</p><p> I&rsquo;m going to show you how to wow your audience.</p><p> After studying hundreds of hours of TED Talks, we have found that there are patterns between the most popular speakers&mdash;the ones who can get the standing ovation and the ones that are great, but can&rsquo;t quite wow their audience to their feet.</p><p> To get a standing ovation you have to capture the minds of your audience by dominating the 3 areas of a speech:</p><li> Your Message: The best speakers are able to package a strong message into piercing take-aways for the audience.</li><li> Your Verbal Approach: The best speakers also have specific verbal patterns that they use to capture the imagination and hearts of their audience.</li><li> Your Nonverbal Cues: The best speakers use nonverbal signals to energize their audience and cue the brain to take note.</li><p> <br/> In this post I want to go through the mechanics of each area to get a standing ovation worthy speech.</p><h3> Your Message:</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s start with your message. Speakers package their message in a very unique formula to make sure it is heard by the audience. Here&rsquo;s how:</p><h3> 1. Oh Golly Gee!</h3><p> <br/> Here is the number one mistake speakers make:</p><p> Thinking credible means unemotional.</p><p> Many speakers who are trying to come across as professional and serious think that they have to deliver direct, emotionless speeches. This is the problem with most of the least popular TED Talks. They are interesting, well-presented speeches that are stiff and boring! Having emotions, caring about your work and fusing energy into your talk does NOT make you more professional. It makes your professional message more palatable.</p><p> Emotions are the condiments of speeches.</p><p> Emotions add spice, flavor and personality to your talk, your stories and your ideas. Here are the most common emotions speakers can add to their talks:</p><li> Passion</li><li> Vulnerability</li><li> Awe</li><li> Regret</li><li> Excitement</li><li> Fear</li><li> Power <br/>  </li><h3> 2. The Solvable Problem</h3><p> <br/> I hate to say it, but there is a formula to standing ovation worthy speeches. This formula taps into 2 fundamental human needs&mdash;that we don&rsquo;t want to feel alone with our suffering and that someone can offer us a solution.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470632011/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470632011&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rrulecom-20&amp;linkId=27FWMGUNOHTOUG75\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nancy Duarte </a>  analyzed hundreds of the top speeches from history. She looked at everything from Steve Job&rsquo;s iPhone announcement to Martin Luther King&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo; speech. She found that all of them follow a simple structure:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470632011/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470632011&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rrulecom-20&amp;linkId=27FWMGUNOHTOUG75\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p><p> All good speeches start with a problem we all recognize&mdash;this instantly taps into a common pain that we can relate to and want solved. It is the problem of &lsquo;what is&rsquo; or what is happening right now that is wrong. This peaks attention. Then the speaker promises a solution for this problem&mdash;which alleviates worry and provides relief to the audience. This is the &lsquo;what could be.&rsquo; The best speeches go between problems and solutions, taking the audience on an emotional journey. (See her full AMAZING TED talk if you want the details:)</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1nYFpuc2Umk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"661\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-11.20.51-AM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> Example: Martin Luther King&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Have a Dream Speech&rdquo;:</p><li> Problem: &ldquo;America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked &ldquo;insufficient funds.&rdquo; &ldquo;</li><li> Solution: &ldquo;But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we&rsquo;ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Anyone can do this with large or small lectures. For example, I do this with body language in every presentation I give.</p><li> Problem: &ldquo;How many times have you walked into a party or a networking event and instantly felt awkward and uncomfortable?&rdquo;</li><li> Solution: &ldquo;The best way to combat your awkwardness is with a success routine.&rdquo;</li><li> Problem: &ldquo;The hardest part about sales is building trust. You love your product, you love your brand, but you have no idea how to share this love with a potential client without coming across as spammy or aggressive.&rdquo;</li><li> Solution: &ldquo;There is an incredibly easy way to fix this. They are called trust indicators.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> 3. A Greater Future</h3><p> <br/> As you take your audience on a journey of problems and solutions, you culminate your message with a promise of a greater future. The best speakers paint the picture of the best possible future that their message can provide. In other words, if every audience member uses your tips and solutions what will their life look like? What will their day look like? What will change for them? This can be both small and large&mdash;perhaps it&rsquo;s the future of how they use their phone (if you have a new app) or the future of better health (if you have a new diet). You want to show them the outcome that proves why your solutions are worth the effort.</p><li> <a href=\"http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=70&amp;page=transcript\" target=\"_blank\">  President Franklin Roosevelt </a>  addressed Congress in 1941 with a powerful speech that promised: &ldquo;Freedom from fear&ndash;which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor&ndash;anywhere in the world. That is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation. To that new order we oppose the greater conception&ndash;the moral order. A good society is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear.&rdquo;</li><li> Steve Jobs promised audience members: &ldquo;So, today, we&rsquo;ve added to the Mac and the iPod. We&rsquo;ve added Apple TV and now iPhone. And you know, the Mac is really the only one that you think of as a computer. Right? And so we&rsquo;ve thought about this and we thought, you know, maybe our name should reflect this a little bit more than it does. So we&rsquo;re announcing today we&rsquo;re dropping the computer from our name, and from this day forward, we&rsquo;re going to be known as Apple Inc., to reflect the product mix that we have today. The Mac in 1984 is an experience that those of us that were there will never forget. And I don&rsquo;t think the world will forget it either. The iPod in 2001 changed everything about music, and we&rsquo;re going to do it again with the iPhone in 2007.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> Your Verbal Approach:</h3><p> <br/> What are some of the verbal tactics of the best speakers? Here I break down the most powerful word strategies you can use from stage:</p><h3> <br/> 4. Once Upon a Time</h3><p> <br/> Have you heard the writing advice &ldquo;Show, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rdquo;? The same applies for speakers. Speakers can tell audiences the problems and solutions, but showing the problems in real life and the solutions in action requires stories. Stories are incredibly powerful because our brains eat them up!  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1137370122/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1137370122&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rrulecom-20&amp;linkId=WWOGPTSYUCRSH57T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Research has found </a>  that as you tell a story, the listener&rsquo;s brain activates as if they themselves were in the story! Not only does this capture people&rsquo;s attention, but it also makes your points more memorable. Let me tell you a story about the importance of stories.</p><p> I love science and used to put as many studies and facts into my presentation as possible. My slide deck was filled with nifty charts and stunning graphs. At one speaking event, I showed up and their projector wasn&rsquo;t working&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t show my slides. I basically had to wing it. I was so nervous and worried I almost canceled the event. I thought it was ridiculous to cancel an event just because my slides weren&rsquo;t working so I pulled it together and warned the organizers that it would probably be one of my worst presentations. Since I had no visuals to go off of I had to explain the experiments as stories (without numbers) and rely on examples from real people I taught instead of formal case studies. At the end of the speech the room burst to their feet&mdash;it was a small room of about 25 people, but still I was floored! I got some of the best feedback from that speech than I had ever gotten. Why? I used stories to show my points instead of dry facts and figures.</p><li> Think of the 3 main problems in your speech. Now think of stories to demonstrate them.</li><li> Think of the 3 main solutions in your speech. Now think of examples of people who used them. <br/> ​</li><h3> 5. A Laughing Mindset</h3><p> <br/> I am not going to tell you to put a bunch of jokes in your speech&mdash;although it would be great if you did, I know that it is almost impossible to try to come up with jokes that don&rsquo;t come naturally. So instead I am going to ask you to consider a laughing mindset. We noticed that the best speakers&mdash;the ones that got standing ovations had people smiling and mentally smiling throughout a Talk even when it was serious. What I mean by mentally smiling is that the speaker set-up inside jokes and a congeniality with the audience that felt like sitting with an old friend.</p><p> Watch Ken Robinson&rsquo;s Ted Talk. He does an amazing job of keeping the laughing mindset. He does tell jokes, but he also gives you the feeling that you are an old friend and you are about to have a good time:</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iG9CE55wbtY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-11.54.02-AM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how you can create a laughing mindset:</p><li> Create an inside joke. Stand up comedians do this really well. I went to hear one stand up comedian and at the very beginning he started off with, &ldquo;Oh brother, you know what happened to me today?&rdquo; Then he told an amusing&mdash;but not laugh-out-loud story. Then he did it again. &ldquo;Oh brother, you know what happened to me yesterday?&rdquo; and continued with another story. By the end of the routine, he could just say, &ldquo;Oh brother.&rdquo; And the audience would laugh. He created his own inside joke with the audience&mdash;both funny and powerful.</li><li> Act it out. Sometimes a well-placed eyebrow raise or an exasperated sigh can loosen up the audience to the laughing mindset. Think of some of your stories that you came up with in point #3. Can you act out any aspects of your stories? Did your kid give you a hard time about something? Can you mimic them? Did you stumble into a bar late one night? Wink, wink, nudge nudge. Try to punctuate your words with expressions of your points. This pulls the audience towards you.</li><li> Smile to inspire. When you smile you cue the audience to relax and smile. As you will see below, smiling also helps your perceptions of intelligence. <br/>  </li><h3> 6. Rhetoric &amp; Metaphors</h3><p> <br/> Researcher  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/06/learning-charisma-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  John Antonakis </a>  analyzed speech patterns and found that the most charismatic speakers use more metaphors. Why? These get the brain engaged. Rhetorical questions also keep your audience awake and helps them understand your main message.</p><li> Rhetorical Questions: A rhetorical question is a question you ask of the audience without requiring a response. Something like, &ldquo;Do you know how this tip can work for you?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How many of you have felt like the man in the story?&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t need people to actually raise their hands (although they might). The reason these are so powerful is because any kind of question engages people mentally; we are programmed to respond to questions even if it is just internal. <br/>  </li><h3> Your Nonverbal Cues:</h3><p> <br/> Your body language is an incredibly important ingredient for your speech&rsquo;s success. We are giving off nonverbal signals all the time&mdash;you have to make sure they ADD to your message and not take away from it. I have talked about nonverbal cues before, so in this post I want to summarize the most important body language cues for speakers.</p><li> Metaphors: Metaphors are like mini-stories. You tie something that someone understands to a new idea or concept. I LOVE metaphors&mdash;I think they are the most powerful way to get ideas across. For example, I teach people how to read microexpressions and liken the ability to decode the face to watching life in High Definition&mdash;all of a sudden you see things that you didn&rsquo;t notice before. In other words, I turn the skill of decoding facial expressions into a metaphor with the connection to HD TV. WHENEVER I use this metaphor with live audiences people will either audibly say, &ldquo;oh&rdquo; or &ldquo;ah&rdquo; or nod their head yes, as if it clicked for them. That&rsquo;s the power of a good metaphor.</li><p>  </p><h3> 7. Nonverbal Credibility</h3><p> We took some time in our lab to analyze the body language of internet experts&mdash;those online celebrities who have massive cult-like followings. They have the equivalent of standing ovations on their 1 million plus viewed videos. I identified 7 patterns from 7 leading experts that you can use:</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6ct0zVSn2qo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"666\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-11.56.53-AM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><h3> 8. Nonverbal Charisma</h3><p>  </p><p> Remember our TED Talk experiment? One of the patterns that became apparent when comparing the most popular TED Talks with the least popular TED Talks was how speakers used their hands. The more hand gestures, the more successful the Talk. There was a direct correlation between the number of views on a TED Talk and the number of hand gestures.</p><li> The bottom TED Talks had an average of 124,000 views and used an average of 272 hand gestures during the 18 minute talk.</li><li> The top TED Talks had an average of 7,360,000 views and used an average of 465 hand gestures&mdash;that&rsquo;s almost double!</li><li> By the way, Temple Grandin, Simon Sinek and Jane McGonigal topped the hand gesture charts with over 600 hand gestures in just 18 minutes. <br/>  </li><p> When you speak with your hands it&rsquo;s like you are engaging your audience&rsquo;s brain on 2 different tracks. You are explaining your ideas with your words AND your hands. This is both memorable and engaging.</p><h3> 9. Nonverbal Engagement</h3><p> <br/> Nonverbal communication isn&rsquo;t just about body language, its also about vocal cues. We had our evaluators rate the TED speakers on vocal variety, or the amount of fluctuation in their voice tone, volume and pitch. Again, the relationship was clear. The more vocal variety a speaker had, the more views they had. When you are practicing giving your speech or your next presentation, try saying your words at least 5 different ways. Practice putting emphasis on different words, slowing and speeding up your pace and varying your volume on important points.</p><li> It&rsquo;s OK to memorize your speech, but it&rsquo;s better to internalize it. When your speech feels so natural that it is ingrained in your mind, you will deliver it like it is your own personal story.</li><li> Scripts kill. Don&rsquo;t ever, ever script your speech. There is no way you can read with the same natural vocal charisma as a speech that is conveyed without a script. You can bullet point, but don&rsquo;t script and don&rsquo;t read! <br/>  </li><h3> 10. Smile Tall and Smile Proud</h3><p> <br/> This finding is the only pattern that goes against the current research. Studies on smiling have found that leaders typically smile less. Nonverbal scientists believe that smiling is actually a low power behavior. However, in our research we found that the longer a TED speaker smiled, the higher their perceived intelligence ratings were. Those who smiled at least 14 seconds were rated as higher in intelligence than those who smiled for less. Doesn&rsquo;t this seem counter-intuitive? When we think of an intelligent person, we usually think of someone very serious. But even when TED Talkers were speaking about a serious topic, like Sheryl Sandberg&rsquo;s talk on women leaders, smiling still helped her intelligence ratings.</p><li> No matter how serious your topic, find something to smile about.</li><li> Always smile upon being introduced and during your applause (hopefully, your ovation). Start on a high and end on a high. <br/>  </li><p> Watch this video to understand how we found our TED patterns:</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wkfYzs2Qv-M\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-12.56.29-PM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></p><h3> Conclusion:</h3><p> Utilize these tips, internalize these tips and practice these tips until they become your own.

{"original_id":2214,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Active, Passive and Personal","link":"active-passive-and-personal","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Building Better Investment Strategies by Putting the Client First</h3><p> <br/> Our Chief Investment Officer, Sean Clark, recently participated in a panel at the CFA Institute&rsquo;s June Symposium in Philadelphia to discuss the merits of active and passive investing. Investment managers with a one-sided view can get pretty heated on the topic and, unfortunately, when investors see the passive camp trashing the active camp and vice versa, it implies that one methodology is right and the other is wrong. Fortunately, what made the CFA panel constructive was its ability to shed light on the merits of both active and passive investment strategies.</p><p> All of the panelists at the event agreed that asset allocation must come first, before any discussion of the kind of instrument used to implement the asset allocation. After all, as Sean pointed out, asset allocation determines more than 90% of returns over time.1</p><h3> Unravelling the One-Size-Fits-All Approach</h3><p> <br/> Vanguard&rsquo;s Jack Bogle, who pioneered low-cost indexing, kicked off the conference. Mr. Bogle sits squarely in the passive camp, advocating long-term, buy and hold investing in index funds. In other words, buy in, sit tight and ride out the market&rsquo;s ups and downs. While this might be the best approach for investors who have a strong appetite for risk and the fortitude to withstand tumultuous market environments, time has shown us that many investors panic and sell out of the markets during a downturn, locking in losses. When clients cash out of their investments during a downturn, they jeopardize their ability to meet their goals &mdash; even though market downturns are natural, sometimes even healthy, events.  <strong>  No two investors are alike, and we believe a disciplined, diversified and personalized approach can help investors keep their calm through bear markets. </strong></p><p> Jack Bogle telling investors to sit tight and buy low-cost index funds is a little bit like the FDA telling Americans to eat right and exercise to stay healthy. In theory it sounds right but in practice, well &hellip; some of us could use a more active approach. After all, everyone has a different genetic makeup, different levels of self-discipline and different predispositions to health conditions. A one-size-fits-all approach is not always best for everyone.</p><p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.ccmg.com/?p=1239\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A Healthy Serving of Active and Passive  </a> </u> , I compared the active vs. passive debate to America&rsquo;s diet obsession. Fad diets (we&rsquo;ve all heard of the grapefruit diet and the cookie diet) might work at first, but they leave the body malnourished and can lead to the development of harmful habits.</p><p> The same holds true for one&rsquo;s investment allocation. Cutting out one style or type of investment entirely in favor of another can increase risk and derail an investor&rsquo;s long-term plan. A more moderate, diversified approach has a higher likelihood of success. It&rsquo;s all about creating good habits, because bad habits can slowly build up and undermine the chances of achieving one&rsquo;s goals. As Warren Buffet said, &ldquo;Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.&rdquo;</p><p> Without diversification, portfolio risk goes up and we can be tempted to put all of our assets into a single investment style or the asset class outperforming its peers at a given time. When we search for shortcuts, we can easily lose track of the long-term benefits of investing and make bad decisions in the here and now.</p><h3> Oversimplification Is Rife with Risk</h3><p> <br/> No approach to investing is a silver bullet by itself, but investors can be tempted to go all-in with one approach if it seems as if that approach is winning. As humans, we seek simplicity, and we prefer to take the shortest route possible towards our goals.</p><p> The loudest talkers &mdash; and the ones who can simplify investing down to its most granular level &mdash; are the ones that are winning right now. Passive, low-cost investing is the clear winner in the headlines right now. Should that surprise anyone? We are 6+ years into a bull market! Many of today&rsquo;s investors might be hopping on the train when the next stop is a bear market. The S&amp;P 500 index, for example, has tripled from its 2009 lows.2</p><h3> Putting Clients&rsquo; Needs First Helps Build Better Investment Strategies</h3><p> <br/> Clark Capital&rsquo;s advice is to start with the investor&rsquo;s needs and goals first. Begin by gaining a solid understanding of how they think about money, their ability to handle stress and volatility in the markets, and their long-term aspirations. Only then can you begin to craft an investment strategy that can truly meet the needs of an investor in good times and bad. We call it a client-first approach. It centers the conversation on the client&rsquo;s goals rather than financial products. And instead of active or passive, the investment is personalized. The goal is to keep the clients within their personal risk comfort zone so they can stay in the markets and don&rsquo;t sell off in a panic. In other words, they can stay &ldquo;in it to win it.&rdquo;</p><p> According to Sean, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe active and passive should be an &lsquo;either or&rsquo; decision for an advisor or client, and they should not be mutually exclusive investment styles in a portfolio. In fact, the 2013 Nobel Prize for Economics was shared by world-renowned professors with opposite views. In one corner was Eugene Fama, who is an advocate of passive, investing; and in the other, Robert Shiller, who is an advocate of active management. The two styles complement each other and help to build a more robust portfolio; they aid in risk management and diversification.&rdquo; </p><p> The world&rsquo;s markets are complex, filled with risk, uncertainty and opportunity and are constantly changing. We believe the best approach is one that can help a client stay focused on the future, while confidently pursuing their goals.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-27 18:21:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-27 18:21:07.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_bJf8xtt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/active-passive-and-personal/\", \"post_id\": \"5013\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-27 18:21:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-27 18:21:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"active-passive-and-personal\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5012\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2257\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Nav-Insights-Picture-for-Active-Passive-Personal.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"742\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438084800,"author_id":376,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2213,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Best Prescription for RMD Woes","link":"the-best-prescription-for-rmd-woes","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My accountant likes to remind me that I shouldn't be upset that I have to pay more in taxes in a given year. It just means that you've made more money, he tells me, and how can you be upset by that?</p><p> Well for someone like myself, who's still working and can manage these fluctuations, it's not a big deal. But for people who are in retirement, the impact of investing success results in unexpected higher required minimum distributions, or RMDs, that can significantly impact their income levels and nest eggs.</p><p> I recently spoke with James Merklinghaus of JM &amp; KM Wealth Management and he described a situation that he's seeing more of with his clients:</p><p> \"I had a retired couple come to me because the upcoming tax hit on their required minimum distribution seemed incredibly unfair. Here they were, both still freelancing in their dream professions, in fabulous health, and with a brood of kids and grandkids they had hoped to leave an inheritance to. They had forgotten about the RMD on their combined half-million dollar 401(k)s and IRAs, and they saw their future and that of their heirs quickly disappearing in checks made out to the IRS,\" Merklinghaus recounted.</p><p> Merklinghaus does point out that these clients were in the enviable position of not needing to spend their retirement money, and instead wanted an investment strategy to minimize and delay taxes. But for other clients, who depend on a level flow of income, the tax bite of RMDs can provide for unplanned fluctuations that could lead to an impact on their lifestyle.</p><p> Fortunately for Merklinghaus and his clients, he uses his experience to work with his clients before retirement by designing strategies that address their specific situations and consider RMDs into all planning scenarios. Because of that, he may use different strategies to counter the potential impact of RMDs for clients.</p><p> \"In this couple's case, they didn't need the income from the RMD yet, and they didn't want to pay the forced taxes &mdash; that's the perfect set-up for a qualified longevity annuity contract (QLAC),\" Merklinghaus said.</p><p> QLACs came on the scene a few years ago precisely for people who wanted to keep investments in place, tax-free. In 2014 it was an investment approved by the Department of the Treasury and the IRS to use inside 401(k)s and IRAs.</p><p> You don't want to mess with the RMD because the penalty for failing to take the RMD is 50% of what you should have taken out, plus the tax. If this couple had failed to take their combined RMD of $30,000, they would have owed a $15,000 penalty, plus taxes on $30,000. Instead, they were able to invest in a QLAC, and defer paying taxes on the money until they turn 85, when they will be in a more favorable tax bracket.</p><p> With a QLAC, participants can defer $125,000 or 25% of the account balance (whichever is less). This reduces the RMD each year during the deferral period and the tax due on that amount of distribution.</p><p> There are  <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/why-the-new-qualifying-longevity-annuity-contract-qlac-rmd-regulations-for-dont-mean-much-for-retirement-income-yet/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  some restrictions with a QLAC </a> , but if you have concerns about RMDs, it may be something to discuss with your financial adviser.</p><p> Another approach that Merklinghaus uses where appropriate is the \"stretch IRA,&rdquo; which isn't a type of individual retirement account, but rather it is a feature used in estate planning or a financial strategy that allows people to stretch out the life &mdash; and therefore the tax advantages &mdash; of an IRA.</p><p> Having a problem with RMDs might seem to be an enviable position, but discussing these options with your financial adviser can provide options to consider.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-27 18:14:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-27 18:14:49.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_m93E17j.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-best-prescription-for-rmd-woes/\", \"post_id\": \"5009\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-27 18:14:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-27 18:14:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-best-prescription-for-rmd-woes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5008\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2255\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Prescription-Writing.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"622\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438095600,"author_id":205,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2212,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Drivers of Value: Maximize What Your Advisory Firm is Worth","link":"drivers-of-value-maximize-what-your-advisory-firm-is-worth","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Today, we are looking at a wave of transition and consolidation among Independent Investment Advisors. With a multitude of advisors rapidly approaching retirement age and also facing the challenges of technology updates, now is the right time to step back from the fray.</p><p> For many advisors, equity in the practice is the foundation of their retirement plan. They need to maximize the value of their practice before they sell&mdash;a process that can take as much as five years. So where should advisors start?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at the main drivers of valuation for an advisor&rsquo;s practice and how each can be improved.</p><h3> Growth</h3><p> <br/> There is no more important element of practice valuation than growth&mdash;both in total size of a practice and in profitability. A healthy practice steadily brings in new clients and increases earnings, year after year. Not only does growth counteract the natural attrition of clients&mdash;who move, divorce, pass away, etc&mdash;but it also provides a future for the firm&rsquo;s staff, who can advance and take on additional responsibility. An advisor who doesn&rsquo;t devote his or her firm to growth will have a much harder time selling the practice.</p><h3> Client Loyalty</h3><p> <br/> A 2012 study by NFP and Aite found that &ldquo;one in three advisors who acquired a practice as part of building their own book of business reported that the acquisition resulted in a client retention rate of less than 50%.&rdquo; A key to getting one&rsquo;s money&rsquo;s worth from an acquisition is to carefully match service models and philosophies and to pay attention to the stickiness of the client list. This is good for the seller as well as the buyer, as it will improve the earn-out at the end of the deal.</p><h3> Team</h3><p> <br/> In financial services, people are the product&mdash;their intelligence, training, diligence and organization are the foundation of success. Advisors need to make sure their team has appropriate certifications and licenses, which will add to the overall credibility and attractiveness of the firm.</p><p> In addition, an advisor&rsquo;s service team has strong relationships with clients. Are they staying with the practice? To improve valuation, they should be offered incentives to stay on board for at least a year after the transition to new ownership. This will help with client retention.</p><h3> Process</h3><p> <br/> The way a practice is organized will determine, in large part, the success of a transition to new ownership. Philosophies of client service and investment management should be a good match. But so, too, should be record keeping, software platforms, client relationship management and communication styles. Process is what enables the new advisor to learn the clients quickly and continue serving them without missing a beat. An advisor who is looking to sell a practice should make sure that technology is up to date, client data is complete, workflows are uniform and documented, and people in the office know every procedure.</p><h3> Brand</h3><p> <br/> Advisors who take time to build a brand for their firm&mdash;in addition to bolstering their personal reputation&mdash;will have an easier time transitioning a practice.

{"original_id":2211,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Learn Why Your Digital Assets Matter","link":"learn-why-your-digital-assets-matter","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/estateassistus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Estate Assist  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  The digital revolution is moving almost everyone in developed countries into a paperless society. </strong> For the majority of us, meaningful documents such as bank transactions and stock trades happen exclusively in the digital realm. In a similar way, memories captured through photography or videography are no longer subject to tangible media such as paper, scrapbooks, DVDs, VHS cassettes, and cumbersome film. Having a paperless life also means everything that has transactional meaning is often behind a password and, in some instances, fully secured within a two-factor authentication platform. After all, the corporations that are leading the way into the digitalization of information want your information to be both private and secure.</p><p> We know that your digital assets are important to you, and chances are you interact with many of them on a daily basis. Some have financial value; others are purely sentimental in nature but deeply important to you as well as your loved ones. Aside from making certain your digital assets are safely stored, it makes sense to put together a plan to transition your digital assets to an heir in the event of your death; or to make them available to your spouse or partner, should you become ill and unable to manage the day-to-day affairs for which your digital assets exist. Before we take a closer look at the best ways to organize, centralize, transfer, and share your digital assets, let&rsquo;s take a moment to identify the types of digital assets that are likely to have value for you in your daily interactions, and to those you love, to help them transition when you are no longer around.</p><h3> Photography</h3><p> <br/> Photography is perhaps one of the most meaningful digital assets. In most instances, the value is purely sentimental, as it helps tell the stories that weave the fabric that makes families strong. In the past, family pictures were transferred from parents to children in boxes, albums, and frames, and it was not uncommon to witness family feuds over who was going to keep what. The rise in digital photography has radically changed the rules of the game, facilitating endless sharing among family members. Unfortunately, many beautiful digital memories are lost forever due to careless archiving or when someone passes away, and the original files are behind a password unknown to others.</p><p> Beyond the sentimental aspect, many photos have economic value due to their artistic qualities, or because they capture a moment in history. If you are a photographer who is capturing images as an art or as part of your profession as a photojournalist, then safekeeping of your images is a matter of stewardship and legacy.</p><h3> Email and Instant-Messaging Communications</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t be too quick to dismiss the value of your email communications. Within your email archives, you are likely to have a beautiful narrative of your personal life, or in some instances priceless information and opinion related to your profession. Keeping your email archives is useful when someone needs to transition job responsibilities. Those left in charge will find valuable nuggets of information that will help them contextualize the current state of affairs, or find reference points when making fiscal decisions associated with the business organization they are tasked with leading. Think about the way emails become part of the archives stored by presidential libraries, or how universities are often the recipients of the rights to archive communications of well-known academics, celebrities, and scientists. In a similar way, instant messages may contain information that is key in understanding how to handle future business interactions, or as a way to remember someone we loved once they are no longer with us.</p><h3> Illustration, Animations, Drawings, and Logos</h3><p> <br/> Not every person has a penchant for art and graphic design, but those who do must be extra careful about storing and archiving the original digital files associated with their work. It is valuable in the here and now and has great potential moving forward. Many visual artists have fully abandoned traditional media and mainly work using digital tools. Having a good digital record of original works is useful when dealing with unauthorized use, and as a basis for secondary work. The quality of digital artists continues to rise more and more. Just a few minutes spent browsing at the work available at  <a href=\"http://www.curioos.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  www.curioos.com </a>  are enough to fully understand how digital artistry is both meaningful and valuable.</p><h3> Written Work, Presentations, Research, and Spreadsheets</h3><p> <br/> Written media is relevant to all areas of life. Blogs, digital books sold through Amazon Kindle, digital files associated with professional presentations and complex spreadsheets capturing business-relevant data, and providing formulas that track behaviors are just a few examples of digital assets that have value for families, business partners, stockholders, and academic institutions. Having access to files of this nature can mean the difference between a chaotic situation and a seamless transition. In some instances, the rights to a digital asset or intellectual property such as a book may create a constant source of income for your heirs. Make double sure you are tracking intellectual property, and have processes in place to make it available to those that may need to use it when you are no longer around.</p><p> To store, organize, and archive your digital assets, you will need to have a consistent tagging and metadata method that others can use and understand, and a source of storage that is durable, secure, centralized, expandable, and transferable. <strong>  A digital safe deposit box is only as good as the quality of information that you store within it. </strong> Make it a point to audit and track all your digital assets, and begin moving them to your digital safe. Decide who needs to access your data fully or partially in the present, and who is likely to need to access it when you are no longer alive. Storing and transferring digital assets is just one element of proper estate planning, but many experts agree that doing it right will likely have a positive emotional and financial impact on the lives of those that you love and are left behind to deal with the realities of life without you.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-27 17:53:11.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-27 17:53:11.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_hwRFldG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/learn-why-your-digital-assets-matter/\", \"post_id\": \"5005\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-27 17:53:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-27 17:53:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"learn-why-your-digital-assets-matter\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5004\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2253\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437282124659-ee218f408c4c.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"417\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438080300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

This strength involves an active interest in life experiences and includes novelty seeking, exploration, and openness. </p><h3> Here are five ways you can use curiosity to help you bring more passion, presence, and purpose to your life and relationships. </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Draw upon Curiosity to help you make decisions, even small or simple ones.  </strong> Last week, I stopped into one of my favorite home decorating stores, where I always find something new and exciting. Within minutes, I had found several things I wanted. As I carried a few items around the store, I started asking myself questions. How much do I like each item? Where will it go in my home? What purpose will it serve?  Will I still love it in a year?  I have been on a personal mission to declutter my home, simplify my spaces, and part with items that don&rsquo;t bring me joy. Allowing myself the time to reflect on these questions before leaving the store, I saved myself a trip to the return counter and I saved room in the donation box for something else.   <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Leverage Curiosity to learn about yourself and increase your self-awareness. </strong>   I realized that one of my three core values no longer &ldquo;felt right&rdquo; so I set aside some time last week to reflect on this. I&rsquo;ve been making it a priority to ensure all of my personal and professional intentions and goals align to my values, so I really wanted them to be accurate. I came up with three possibilities then got out my journal to explore each of them further. I got curious about how these different values had been showing up in my life lately. Through this process of discovery, I was able to quickly clarify which one of the three was most prominent and made the adjustment to my top three core values.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Use your curiosity to explore and open yourself to new experiences.  </strong> I attended a gong bath last week. The novelty of this had piqued my curiosity a few months ago. Since I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what a gong bath was or what to expect, I went with noexpectations. It turned out to be a meditation to the sound of a gong. During the meditation, I let go of mental distractions and through my presence, allowed myself to be open to the whole experience. I noticed bodily sensations, I felt emotion as I connected to Spirit, and I left feeling peaceful and calm.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Get curious to de-escalate issues, clear up misunderstandings, and deepen relationships. </strong>  When I found myself getting frustrated during interactions with other people, I became curious about my reactions and reflected on what was triggering me. Rather than sticking with my story, assumptions, and beliefs, I made an effort to ask the other person questions to understand their perspective. I also asked myself, &ldquo;How might it be possible that I&rsquo;m not right in this situation?&rdquo; Doing this helped me quickly de-escalate issues, change my perspective, and get out of my own way to strengthen the relationship.   <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Explore to bring more focus and intention to your work. </strong>  I reflected on what the mission of my business is and where I want to focus my time and energy. I brought clarity to the different ways I&rsquo;d like to make an impact and I generated a whole new list of ideas about how I might go accomplishing my mission. I spent time in inquiry, wondering how all of my Signature Strengths interact to make be a more effective coach and facilitator, and how to leverage my character strengths and my passions in the pursuit of my mission. Now I have a new, purposeful action plan that excites me! <br/> <br/> Curiosity helps us explore and learn about ourselves and other people. We increase our wisdom as we become more open to new experiences and make new discoveries. How can you bring focused attention to the strength of curiosity this week?  Here are just a few ideas.</p><li> Choose a new topic to explore</li><li> Try a new activity</li><li> Look at a problem with a new perspective</li><li> Bring renewed energy or focus to a mundane task by finding novelty in it</li><p> <br/> <strong>  &ldquo;May you experience each day as a sacred gift woven around the heart of wonder.&rdquo;  -John O&rsquo;Donohue </strong></p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-27 17:37:50.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-27 17:37:50.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_NyfCGTt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-ways-to-use-the-strength-of-curiosity/\", \"post_id\": \"5001\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-27 17:37:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-27 17:37:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-ways-to-use-the-strength-of-curiosity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5000\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2251\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437943085269-6da5dd4295bf.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"745\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438110900,"author_id":468,"chart_url":""}

Whether we&rsquo;re at work or going shopping, having a meeting with the kids&rsquo; teachers or taking the car to be serviced&hellip; we all want to be heard, we want to feel valued, and we want to improve our lot in life.</p><h3> Integrity is critical</h3><p> <br/> Whether you employ one person, a hundred or a thousand, the way you deal with customers, vendors and other people is closely scrutinized by your employees. If you say your company values are one thing, but your actions say another, how can you expect those who work for you to act with integrity? Customers experience your values through your employees, so make sure your employees, from the C-Suite on down, understand what&rsquo;s expected of them and walk the talk.</p><h3> Open communication and listening</h3><p> <br/> Just as you want to have an open dialogue with customers, it&rsquo;s important to do the same with employees. Nothing shuts an employee down faster than closing the door and making them feel shut out&mdash;that their opinion doesn&rsquo;t matter. Companies that encourage open dialogue and collaboration will score higher in employee satisfaction&mdash;especially when they show with actions (not just words) that they&rsquo;re listening. Employees who feel valued for their contributions are much more likely to go out of their way to advocate for the brand.</p><h3> Make work easier and reward effort</h3><p> <br/> Stress is one of the biggest contributors to workplace dissatisfaction&mdash;especially when job security is an issue or an employee feels that their job is made too difficult to complete successfully. When high expectation of performance is coupled with poor practices and lack of adequate tools, job stress is the natural outcome. This is where better communication and listening on the part of the employer is critical. Because your employees work your systems every day, all day, they know where the bottlenecks are and should be your first line of inquiry when smoothing out business practices. Listen to their suggestions. Give them the tools they need to get their jobs done more efficiently and be responsive in praising their efforts, and you&rsquo;ll have happier, more productive employees.</p><h3> Empower social sharing</h3><p> <br/> Your customers share their experiences with your brand on social networks, and if you&rsquo;re doing things right, they&rsquo;re sharing good experiences. Making it easy for them to share your content and spread the word in their networks is a great way to scale positive brand perception. The same can be said of your employees.  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/ror-companies-must-allow-employees-to-use-social/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Censoring employees  </a> </u>  on social media only hurts your company. They&rsquo;re going to talk about their work experiences in their own social networks anyway, so wouldn&rsquo;t you want them to share positive things?

{"original_id":2207,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Four Ways to Lead Through Failure","link":"four-ways-to-lead-through-failure","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;Failure is NOT an option!&rdquo;</p><p> This unspoken NASA creed was in understood to be in effect during every mission, especially the Apollo 13 Houston-We-Have-a-Problem episode.</p><p> While this quote makes a great motivational mantra to build team enthusiasm, it is not reality. In fact, failure is ALWAYS an option. The Apollo 13 astronauts could have easily launched themselves on an endless journey into deep space. Whether internal error or outside occurrences beyond our foresight or control, failure happens. But what are we to do as leaders in the midst of failure?</p><h3> 1. Maintain enthusiasm </h3><p> &ldquo;Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.&rdquo; &ndash; Winston Churchill</p><p> A good leader keeps her or his head up during tough times. The leader is called to stand on a parapet and look out towards the horizon, discovering possibilities. Shoegazing at the problem at hand will not inspire confidence, lead the troops, or promote outside-the-box thinking needed to find solutions. When, as a leader, you take this higher view, you can maintain enthusiasm without becoming a false, rah-rah cheerleader, and this you must not become. Your team will disregard inauthentic attempts at motivation. Instead, be honest, stating clearly, &ldquo;I know things are rough,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Okay, we did experience failure on this project.&rdquo; But quickly let them know that though this battle may be lost, there are more battles coming which are quite winnable.</p><p> Churchill, one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century, experienced colossal failures in individual battles, yet he kept a can-do attitude. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going through hell, keep going,&rdquo; he said, as well as his famed statement on adversity:</p><p> &ldquo;Never give in&ndash;never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Shape the story</h3><p> Failure is often measured by the numbers&ndash;a poor profit statement, an abysmal product launch, or a bad department review. But know this, no data is ever perceived in an entirely objective manner. Everyone sees the data through their own colored lenses and shapes their views of the current situation within the context of their internal narrative. This is always true, no matter how analytical a person appears to be. In bad (and good) situations, as a leader you should never pitch data &ldquo;neutrally&rdquo; before your team without context. Recent studies have shown they won&rsquo;t receive it without bias. Instead, as the leader, you must shape the context by telling the story that surrounds the data. Leaders articulate, &ldquo;Here is what the data means, and here is our response to this challenge or failure.&rdquo; To maintain morale, be sure to tell the story of past obstacles that have been overcome through your team&rsquo;s smart and diligent efforts. Include historical stories of those who faced incredible failure and saw the cards stacked against them, yet they succeeded. (See Abraham Lincoln, Apollo 13, and the WWII Allies if you need fodder.)</p><h3> 3. Encourage Failure</h3><p> Wait, what? Yes, good leaders encourage micro-failures to avoid macro-failures. Applying creative efforts that have a chance of failing to the smaller scope of a problem is crucial to overcoming over-arching failure at the highest levels. Encourage your team to think beyond traditional solutions while providing them safe boundaries to work within. In this way, if things go south, one area of the project is affected by the creative effort&rsquo;s failure, but, hopefully, cross-infection into other areas of the project can be avoided.</p><p> Many businesses have team members who are so afraid of the reaction from on high, they become paralyzed, unable to come to any viable solution when failure or problems occur. Reward your team members for innovative efforts regardless of the outcome. Today&rsquo;s botched solution may become tomorrow&rsquo;s genius idea.</p><p> Have team members or departments share their failures with other team members without reprisal. Of course, before they share it, you will want to vet their presentation to help them shape the context and narrative. Good leaders are always story-shapers. Having those under your leadership hear others say, &ldquo;We hit a huge pothole. The wheels came off, and here is how we are putting them back on,&rdquo; is a way to ensure your team stays nimble in their thinking when failure does occur.</p><h3> 4. Keep a Failure Catalog</h3><p> Failure is rarely an end in itself. It is simply a means for a great leader to say, &ldquo;Ouch, let&rsquo;s learn from that and not allow that to happen again.&rdquo; Keep a catalog of your failures with the story of how you overcame each of them attached. This record will give you great hope when a new failure or problem arises. You can view a situation that seems insurmountable, and reflect back as you realize many other problems appeared to be the Mount-Everest-of-all-failures in their time. You survived and grew from those failures. You&rsquo;ll grow from this one, as well.</p><h3> Remember</h3><p> Failure IS always an option. In fact, to fail is human, and every leader, at last check, was human. Press forward when failure happens, using your talents and skills to lead through adversity&mdash;maintain enthusiasm, tell stories, encourage failure, and keep a catalog. It is this type of leadership that will inspire your team and, should a large enough problem occur, place your name in the history books alongside other great leaders. Remember, failure is merely a means to better the story of future success. </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-27 17:29:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-27 17:29:47.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_g1gHEh7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/four-ways-to-lead-through-failure/\", \"post_id\": \"4997\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-27 17:29:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-27 17:29:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"four-ways-to-lead-through-failure\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4996\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2249\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Krawcheck-Sallie-1024x682.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"379\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438099200,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;m sure you have. But, have you ever compared an older car to the brand new floor model? If you have you know how the &ldquo;same features&rdquo; can look completely different. Sure you may have the same features on your older website, but we are here to tell you that it may not be converting as well as you&rsquo;d like it to. Just like cars, websites have a resale value as well&mdash;and this is a big make-or-break point in customers purchasing from your online site.</p><h3> Are you up-to-date?</h3><p> <br/> If you aren&rsquo;t getting the traction or the conversion you want, chances are your website may need some tweaks. Design is one of the single biggest factors in getting customers attracted to your work. Have great content? Wonderful. Does your page look like you spent about twenty minutes on it, and have lackluster design? If so, it&rsquo;s more than likely that your  <u>  content </u>  won&rsquo;t get read no matter how good it is. Just like in every other aspect of life, people go with appearances they like&mdash;they aren&rsquo;t the only factor of consideration, but they can play an important role in decision-making.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s all about testing</h3><p> <br/> Your website is a central office for your  <u>  business </u> , the more customers you get &lsquo;through the door&rsquo; the more chances you have of getting conversions. A 1% increase in traffic could pay huge dividends in terms of thousands of dollars in increased sales each month for your company. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s as simple as putting a security verification symbol at your checkout page, or adding a different opt-in button. Whatever the case may be, if you aren&rsquo;t getting the kind of traffic you want, it never hurts to do some testing. Test the limit of your website and see what people like or don&rsquo;t like about it. Try making small minor changes and gradually add up to a larger website reboot over time.</p><p> Sometimes it&rsquo;s not necessary to do a complete site overhaul. Other times, it&rsquo;s extraordinarily easy to get major spikes in traffic just by redoing your website.</p><p> As content creators and designers, we realize how difficult it is to get this type of work completed. However, we also see the benefits of this for our customers on a daily basis. We work closely with entrepreneurs and website owners every day who can attest to the life-changing effects of having a good website.</p><p> But good looks aren&rsquo;t the only thing that are working for good websites, new features that are familiar on your competitors updated websites may make your older site look outdated. This is definitely a real concern that we need to keep in mind as new themes and design styles increase in popularity. Showing your customers that you can stay up with the times is a great way of showing them that you care and value market trends.</p><h3> Sometimes the best strategy is a new strategy</h3><p> <br/> Revamping your site is an exciting time because its all about creating a better experience for your  <u>  audience </u> .  This is your opportunity to jump into the shoes of your target audience and guide them toward solutions to their problems.  We find that most companies get re-ignited at this stage by getting behind their purpose and hone in on what makes them unique.  A revamp is a great time to not only draw in new prospective clients but to reconnect with your existing customers.  Make them apart of your journey through their testimonials or case studies.</p><p> Remember you only have seconds to leave a lasting impression so make it count by creating a better experience for your audience.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-27 17:16:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-27 17:16:09.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_luJk8gE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-revising-your-website-could-be-the-key-to-your-success/\", \"post_id\": \"4995\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-27 17:16:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-27 17:16:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-revising-your-website-could-be-the-key-to-your-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4994\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2248\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-10.15.20-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"482\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438102800,"author_id":271,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2205,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Triumph of Selling Over Marketing","link":"the-triumph-of-selling-over-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> How good is your marketing? Many advisers believe they are doing great marketing because they are consistently getting new clients. In many cases, though, they are actually poor marketers. What they are good at is selling.</p><p> What's the difference, as long as new clients keep coming on board? Relying on selling (and having a weak marketing plan) makes you work harder and exposes you to long-term risks that reduce the value of your business.</p><p> Here are a couple quick ways to tell whether you have this problem:</p><li> You cannot quickly and succinctly describe your ideal clien</li><li> You find prospective clients by reaching out to them one at a time</li><li> Your clients cannot easily describe your target market</li><li> There are lots of people in your target market who don't know who you are <br/>  </li><p> I knew one particularly gifted business development officer who worked for a financial advisory firm. If he got in front of someone there was a very good chance that person was going to become a client of the firm. But that was exactly the problem. It limited the firm in a couple significant ways.</p><p> Selling happens one-on-one. When this guy was on vacation, no new people were being introduced to the firm. He wasn't scalable.</p><p> Selling is persuasion. This business development officer had a real gift for connecting with people and getting them interested in what the firm had to offer. The problem was that he would tailor the message to whatever that client responded to. There was no overriding and consistent message. Ask five or 10 of the clients he brought in what was special about that company and you would get four or five different answers. It's really hard to build a brand when that's the case.</p><p> I see a lot of this in the advisor business. As long as revenue and profit goals are being met, most advisors never question the efficacy of their marketing. But there is very little marketing going on. I call it the Triumph of Selling.</p><p> There are even bigger implications on succession planning. I used to work at a firm where two of the founding partners were the rainmakers. That's pretty common. They sold the firm to a larger financial institution. The flow of new clients decreased to a trickle. A smart buyer would do some due diligence into where new clients come from. If they find out that every new client is the result of you going out and getting them, and your retirement would mean a serious decline in the rate of the firm's revenue growth, that's going to take a serious bite out of the value of your business.</p><p> Marketing and selling are both important to the health of a business. You cannot succeed without selling. Marketing sets the stage for selling. Marketing can build a brand and a reputation that gets people interested in having the selling conversation. Marketing is one to many. Marketing continues to work when you go away for the weekend. Effective marketing means that you can walk away from the business and the clients will continue to arrive.</p><p> Here are a few ways you can recognize a professional marketing effort:</p><li> The firm offers services that are tailored to us perspective markets needs or interests</li><li> The firm has a brand that communicates consistently one primary message that is distinct from the competition</li><li> The firm regularly appears in places its target market is likely to see it &ndash; magazines, newspapers, events, social media</li><li> When you describe the target market to a prospect or client they immediately think of someone specific that they know <br/>  </li><p> How do clients find your firm?

{"original_id":2204,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"9 Worst Job Search Mistakes by Recent College Graduates","link":"9-worst-job-search-mistakes-by-recent-college-graduates","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As young adults about to enter the day-in-and-day-out lifestyle, you&rsquo;ll quickly discover there are basically three types of people in this world: those that don&rsquo;t, those that do, and those that do effectively. You&rsquo;ll need to be part of the latter group to succeed at your very first professional job search.</p><p> The truth is the title of this article should be  Nine Things Every Person Does Wrong When Job Searching . That title doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;grab&rdquo; because the veterans of the day-in-and-day-out lifestyle are very busy between the day-in and day-out part. Recent college graduates without a job to interrupt their days, however, might have a bit more time to read this. Of course, there&rsquo;s also the freak-out factor. So, when titling our weekly posts, we bloggers tend to cater to those we think will read it. (I&rsquo;m human too.)</p><p> On a serious note, these are bloopers and blunders and you better fix them quickly if you want to get off your parents couch anytime soon. (I assume your parents have over the last few years slowly removed the furniture from your bedroom as mine did so many years ago. It helps them cope when they do it slowly. It turns out they&rsquo;re human too.) Speaking of humans&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t interact with humans. </strong>  The Internet is fabulous, but by itself is generally ineffective. I don&rsquo;t win business simply by sending someone an email. You don&rsquo;t get a job interview simply by submitting your resume via the torturous Applicant Tracking System that has become the bane of your existence. Certainly search and send your resumes, but follow up with a call or voicemail. Why? Guess how many of your peers do it? You wouldn&rsquo;t need all your fingers let alone your thumbs before you hit the number. It is not how many people apply. It&rsquo;s how many people apply, follow up, and follow through. All of sudden, that indicator on the website showing the &ldquo;number of applicants&rdquo; who has applied for the position becomes a meaningless representation of who is truly in the race. Make the call. You&rsquo;ll thank me.</p><p> <strong>  More on humans. You don&rsquo;t develop your professional or personal networks properly. </strong> I&rsquo;m going to apologize for all the &ldquo;adults&rdquo; who made you live in the world of instant gratification. Sorry. I truly am. Developing your network is not solely about finding an accountant who can get you that first accounting job. It&rsquo;s a lifelong, diverse process. In the short-term, however, you need to build your second-degree connections. Those are your friends&rsquo; friends. One of your friends might get you a job interview, but it&rsquo;ll more likely come from one of their friends. If you&rsquo;re an accountant, in addition to thinking  where can I find other accountants , think  where can I find influential people with lots of connections . Like, for example, me or your widely successful aunt, uncle, cousin, or anyone else who knows a lot of good people.</p><p> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t network online effectively. </strong> Unless you&rsquo;ve been living in a dorm cave, you&rsquo;ve heard of LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and so forth. Most people think those sites connect individuals. They do. What most people don&rsquo;t realize is that those sites (and others) are great for connecting with interest groups, meet-up groups, alumni groups, and so. Don&rsquo;t just build your network of online individuals. Build your network of online groups as well. &ldquo;One&rdquo; online connection can mean access to hundreds of thousands of people sharing the same interest.</p><p> <strong>  You look for jobs not companies. </strong> I realize you want a job, but you actually join a company not a job. Look for companies that would benefit from someone with your abilities and studies. If you&rsquo;re an engineer, look for engineering or technology companies regardless of whether they have a job posting. One of the best exercises is to identify companies that are growing. Search lists such as the Inc. 500 and Inc. 5000 or Best Small Companies. Those companies are on those lists for a reason. And, of course, they&rsquo;re growing and hiring people. I know this because they can&rsquo;t get on those lists if they&rsquo;re not hiring people. You&rsquo;re inexpensive. Embrace it. Don&rsquo;t worry about whether they have a job posting that matches something you&rsquo;re qualified to do. Call them. Ask for the Human Resources or Recruitment Department. Tell them you&rsquo;re interested. Send them your resume. It works. (Hey, there&rsquo;s that human thing again.)</p><p> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t leverage your university or college. </strong> I realize these days that the university career offices aren&rsquo;t what they use to be. Everything is online and they basically leave you to your devices. Even so, there are usually websites that the university offers for alumni, companies that are willing to post jobs to those sites, and so forth. LinkedIn also has school alumni groups that share ideas and job listings. Be aggressive when identifying opportunities for your alma mater to aid you.</p><p> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t research enough. </strong> We&rsquo;ve already touched on a few research items related to people and jobs, but mapping your network is a critical research exercise worth its own discussion. In addition to researching and reviewing job openings and companies, you should also make a relationship map as part of that exercise. Here&rsquo;s an example that we used previously. Sure, accountants know other accountants. But, the lawyers and doctors and real estate agents you know use accountants. Business owners know accountants. There are intertwined relationships in the business world. If you can&rsquo;t connect the dots, then ask Mom, Dad, big brother, big sister, cousin Hank, Uncle Bob, or whoever&rsquo;s a Magellan fan to draw you a map of the corporate world.</p><p> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t take to social media fully. </strong> Social media is fun and fabulous. It can provide all kinds of help and get you into all kinds of trouble. Perhaps you saw my recent article called  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/time-for-a-social-media-shower/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Time for a Social Media Shower?  </a> </u>  Breeze through it to ensure you deodorize yourself so you can start your job search April fresh. Most people will leverage the social sites to network or look for jobs. I&rsquo;m okay with that. But, you can also use social media to build your social platform. This can be your elaborate online resume. Start creating your LinkedIn Profile, Twitter Account, Website, Blog or whatever other platforms you enjoy. If you have a cohesive message&mdash;especially if it offers some insight related to your interests&mdash;it could be helpful. I realize my platform leverages three decades of work experience and a significant amount of personally-developed content, but you can review it as an example and align yours accordingly. If you haven&rsquo;t developed much content, you can share articles of interest, comment on them, and be a connector. You might be thinking,  but I have nothing to say . If that&rsquo;s the case, start building your platform by connecting to those with similar interests. This is extremely easy to do on Twitter because you can follow whomever you want. Be a spy first and then go from there.</p><p> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t thank. </strong> Thanking someone is a lost art. In your life, you&rsquo;ll forget to thank many with no other consequence than a disappointing thought from your friends and loved ones. During your job search, it becomes more fatal. Knowing how to thank is one thing. There are many samples ( <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/write-thank-note-gets-job/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How to Write a Thank You Note That Gets You the Job  </a> </u> ). Knowing  whom  to thank is a different story. I&rsquo;m sure 99% of you won&rsquo;t go to this level of effort, but I would suggesting sending thank-you notes (that&rsquo;s an actual piece of paper) to anyone who does  anything  for you during the search. That includes your dad&rsquo;s friend who had lunch with you to provide guidance (you know who you are), the acquaintance who provided a referral for you, the cousin who gave you helpful material to read, your friend who reviewed your resume, and the guy who held the door for you when you went to the restroom. Buy a big stack. Send them out. You think everyone hates paper? Maybe. You know what I do with the thank-you cards I receive? I place them nicely on my desk or bookshelf. I never worry about running out of room because so few people ever bother to send me one. I look at them daily and never forget those who sent them to me. I n-e-v-e-r forget and I meet four thousand new people year in and year out. That&rsquo;s not an exaggeration. Make yourself one of one, not one of four thousand.</p><p> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t optimize your day or focus. </strong> If you only ate hamburgers, you&rsquo;d be fat. If you slept all day, you&rsquo;d never get anything done. This is analogous to what most people&rsquo;s job searches looks like. They&rsquo;re excessive in all the wrong directions or nonexistent. Like everything in life, a balanced and well-planned daily diet will be beneficial. Your day needs to be planned&mdash;effectively. It needs to be executed&mdash;effectively. (I realize you might be working a part-time job, so feel free to adjust accordingly.) It needs to look something like this. How much time you spend in each area might be different each day, but a steady diet of each will serve you well!</p><li> Wake Up. Make sure you&rsquo;re still alive.</li><li> Morning ritual. Do whatever gets you excited&mdash;exercise, meditate, yoga, read, write, eat, shower (please), and coffee.</li><li> Research: Find jobs and companies and build your relationship map.</li><li> Apply: Send your resume to wherever you think is appropriate. This can be directly to a potential employer or acquaintances or friends. Circulating your resume is the key.</li><li> Network. Human interaction! Yay! Call relevant people (or leave voicemails), meet (yes, get up from behind the computer), schedule appointments to meet, etc.</li><li> Write Thank-You Notes: Make sure you keep a list and the bigger the list the better. The more people you need to thank, the more productive your day was. If you&rsquo;re empty here, you had a bad day. Don&rsquo;t fool yourself. The number of people you have to thank on a given day is one of the very best indicators of how productive your day was.</li><li> Plan For Tomorrow: Don&rsquo;t wake up tomorrow thinking about what you need to do. Know in advance. Make it happen!</li><p>  </p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-27 17:06:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-27 17:06:27.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_YgvqcZp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/9-worst-job-search-mistakes-by-recent-college-graduates/\", \"post_id\": \"4991\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-27 17:06:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-27 17:06:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"9-worst-job-search-mistakes-by-recent-college-graduates\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4990\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2246\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAN0AAAAJDFlNTQwNWNhLTJhYmUtNDYxZi05ZTU2LTk0MzFkYTJlYjU5MA.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"488\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438102800,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}

A deeper dive of the survey results further confirms that firms that adopt technology are not only more likely to experience positive AUM growth, but also are growing at faster rates compared to firms that do not adopt any technology systems.</p><p> <strong>  Below are the average 2014 AUM growth rates for each technology adoption category: </strong></p><li> 0 Technology systems: 18%</li><li> 1 Technology system: 27%</li><li> 3+ Technology systems: 40% <br/>  </li><p> While 2014 was undoubtedly a strong year for investment adviser AUM growth regardless of the rate of technology adoption, it&rsquo;s evident that firms that made an aggressive investment in technology experienced significantly higher growth rates. In particular, firms that we consider to be aggressive adopters of technology defined as firms utilizing three or more technology systems, grew AUM more than twice as much as firms utilizing no technology systems.</p><p> Be sure to check back in the coming weeks as we release more sneak previews from our upcoming RIA industry report on growth, technology, investment styles, and advisory fees.  <u>  <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=64c2e3e3-0b41-4d24-a8ce-e8a60d719b51&amp;placement_guid=d51d1631-f03e-4c76-90c0-563a6aaad6be&amp;portal_id=305003&amp;redirect_url=APefjpFO1jjv_r_JmI3O9oE_8Oe_7ugQJxn5O6ws2gEJbzcIEhBVN9gD80hjf2meBYy7gxGUPx4w3qhGY0v-_hk5Arp7bFJIn2ise7cHl3hwYwfNJbYe33CBrliHy0h4Q9sYZVK-yY_mHZrdqIukNVpooWkDQuEDDPeKCqfKfKYhGTwPidYJlGWVqkxgdFKZoJrOYL637fyVOLU633s6AaBK7Wt1RgWH2zPAlzqZHHXUc05srQSUpWDFFRw9hY0WDhwGv-WJblkwNbFBQkUTQEy3iWkHRZhRPmMAYnqvDq8vh4UWBLr-Ic30LwyvjB0wWnJon7m-2A3yd9OlYOp1_OTKM0ooR5HIxA&amp;hsutk=f539e5b784fdee5527ab6158b29f4d57&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fria-firms-that-adopted-technology-grew-aum-faster-in-2014&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fria-firms-that-adopted-technology-grew-aum-faster-in-2014&amp;__hstc=69624975.f539e5b784fdee5527ab6158b29f4d57.1432824585204.1436973233850.1437923994198.8&amp;__hssc=69624975.7.1437923994198&amp;__hsfp=4028816937\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Ten Critical Features of an RIA Technology System  </a> </u></p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-26 15:24:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-26 15:24:23.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_685xuGx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ria-firms-that-adopted-technology-grew-aum-faster-in-2014/\", \"post_id\": \"4987\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-26 15:24:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-26 15:24:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ria-firms-that-adopted-technology-grew-aum-faster-in-2014\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4986\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2244\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-26-at-8.34.29-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"934\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438029900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2201,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Have Banks Made a Fatal Mistake With Apple Pay?","link":"have-banks-made-a-fatal-mistake-with-apple-pay","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I was sitting the other day thinking about the good old days.</p><p> In the good old days, if something was big and challenging, banks would get together and create a co-operative to solve the problem. SWIFT, Visa and MasterCard were all bank created co-operatives.  Admittedly, times have changed and now Visa and MasterCard are private entities, but originally they were created to solve problems that a single bank could not tackle like making global payments and processing billions of card transactions.</p><p> Since the good old days, <strong>  I wonder if banks have taken their eye off the ball. </strong>   A good example is Alipay, Yandex and PayPal.  As the internet took over, banks decided to ignore the need for online payments and let these startups take over.  Now the startups are more than upstarts, as they have taken a major chunk of online transaction processing.</p><h3> Take PayPal&rsquo;s latest exploits. </h3><p> <br/> Last Monday 20th July, PayPal split from its mother ship eBay and rocketed rapidly to a $50 billion valuation. The last time PayPal was trading  publicly in 2002, just before eBay acquired the business, it was valued at $1.5 billion.  That&rsquo;s some explosion of business, especially as the mother ship is worth less than its baby.  eBay was trading at just over $34 billion market cap as PayPal split.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no wonder as PayPal has almost 170 million active users in over 200 markets trading in 57 currencies.</p><br /><p> The thing is that banks should have been creating a collegiate version of PayPal for global online payments. The nearest you get to that is something like the domestic Dutch payments system iDEAL, created to lock out PayPal.  Meanwhile, Sweden has upstarts like Klarna solving the problem in an even better way, and one that doesn&rsquo;t involve using cards.</p><h3> Why didn&rsquo;t the banks cooperate to create a global online payments system?</h3><p> <br/> So now we have Apple Pay in the UK and USA, and banks have been slobbering to get in on the  <u>  <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204916\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   action  </a> </u> . </p><br /><p> I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if, in a few years, every bank is somehow wrapped up in Apple&rsquo;s wallet.  Lovely.</p><h3> The thing is that Apple Pay achieves two things for Apple at the banks expense:</h3><p> <br/> (a)    They own the customer mindshare or relationship if you prefer; and</p><p> (b)   They have the banks completely at their control.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t believe the latter point, then just look at how all the US banks have reduced their fees to ensure they are part of the wallet.  This means that Apple could demand further  <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2682873/apple-pay-nets-a-discount-from-banks-walmart-says-no-thanks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  deep discounting </a>  in the future and, if they get this from one bank, then all the other banks will have to follow.</p><p> So here&rsquo;s where my thinking goes out there to the old days.  If banks could solve insoluble issues in the 1970s by working together, how come they couldn&rsquo;t work together in the 2010s to create a mobile wallet?</p><p> <strong>  Why haven&rsquo;t banks cooperated to create a global mobile payment system? </strong></p><p> The answer is that banks don&rsquo;t trust each other anymore.  However, because of this lack of trust, they&rsquo;re giving the game to the upstarts.  Well done guys.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-25 22:54:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-25 22:54:49.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_asZgC79.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/have-banks-made-a-fatal-mistake-with-apple-pay/\", \"post_id\": \"4985\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-25 22:54:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-25 22:54:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"have-banks-made-a-fatal-mistake-with-apple-pay\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4984\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2243\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-25-at-3.56.21-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"473\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438012800,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

Gates&rsquo; statement made an impact; as of Monday, July 13, &ldquo;the Boy Scouts announced that its executive committee had unanimously adopted a resolution that&hellip; would end the national ban on openly gay volunteer leaders.&rdquo;</p><p> If an institution that&rsquo;s as long standing as the Boy Scouts of America, with age-old policies against the inclusion of diversity, can change and become inclusive of multiple types of sexual orientation, then that sets the bar high for other organizations. For many of us, we&rsquo;re saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time!&rdquo; However, we know how difficult it is to make change happen, and sometimes being inclusive isn&rsquo;t common sense.</p><h3> That&rsquo;s why inclusive leaders need to be incredibly careful with their messaging when trying to bring about change to their businesses.</h3><p> <br/> It isn&rsquo;t enough for a business leader to say that all employees need to be inclusive of different races, sexual orientations and genders because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;the right thing to do.&rdquo; Though we think being inclusive is the right thing morally, it&rsquo;s not enough to sell people on it. As leaders, we have to respect that what we think is the right thing, might be thewrong thing for employees with different religious beliefs or life experiences.  </p><p> This is why Gates&rsquo; message was so effective. He didn&rsquo;t make a call to be inclusive of gay Boy Scout leaders because it was the right thing to do. Instead, &ldquo;his case for change was based on the challenges that he expected the organization would face if it didn't adjust its ways.&rdquo; Gates knew that using pathos to appeal to the audience&rsquo;s moral compass wasn&rsquo;t going to be good enough. In order to bring about change, he had to make it clear that, if they didn&rsquo;t adapt to the times we&rsquo;re in, surely the organization would crumble sooner or later.</p><p> In other words, changing policies to be inclusive of gay male leaders is a good business move for the survival of a huge organization. Inclusion doesn&rsquo;t always have to be the right thing morally (though it&rsquo;s definitely a plus!), but it&rsquo;s always the best thing for the survival and growth of our organizations and companies.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t waste another minute&mdash;be more inclusive of diversity in your office!</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-25 22:30:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-25 22:30:23.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Y5m85fv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/creating-the-message-for-change-what-we-can-learn-from-the-boy-scouts-of-america/\", \"post_id\": \"4983\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-25 22:30:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-25 22:30:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"creating-the-message-for-change-what-we-can-learn-from-the-boy-scouts-of-america\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4982\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2242\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-25-at-3.32.03-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"681\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438002000,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2199,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Surprising Leadership Qualities Financial Planning Clients Look For","link":"surprising-leadership-qualities-financial-planning-clients-look-for","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Do you expect a financial planner to be a strong leader?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Most clients&mdash;89%, in fact&mdash;do. </strong> This finding, from a survey conducted last fall by Advisor Impact for the Financial Planning Association, is hardly surprising.</p><p> What is surprising, however, is the way survey participants described leadership. They said a strong leader should have these four qualities: expertise, skill as a guide, deep understanding, and vulnerability.</p><h3> 1. Expertise.</h3><p> Leaders typically have a strong base of professional expertise that goes beyond general knowledge of their field. This is why continuing education is paramount to good financial planning.</p><p> Even more important, leaders have wisdom, which is the combination of knowledge and experience. A new college graduate has knowledge. A 30-year planner has a high probability of having wisdom.</p><p> Clients want a planner to be an expert, to have knowledge about all things financial, and to know how to apply that knowledge to clients&rsquo; unique circumstances.</p><h3> 2. Skill as a guide.</h3><p> Guiding is the ability to use expertise and wisdom to help clients go, not where the planner thinks they should go, but where they want to go. An effective guide first finds out where clients want to go and then devises the safest, most effective route to get them there and leads the way.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t know of any academic courses that teach financial planners how to guide. It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s learned experientially. Planners learn it by walking the walk, treading the same path for themselves that they will lead their client on.</p><h3> 3. Deep understanding.</h3><p> What&rsquo;s surprising about this quality is the word &ldquo;deep.&rdquo; Certainly, leaders need to understand their followers. But to understand someone deeply is much more intimate and encompassing than a superficial understanding of a person&rsquo;s general needs, intentions or desires.</p><p> Deep understanding comes through hours of genuine  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/weekly-column/clarify-financial-planning-advice-with-reflective-listening\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  listening </a> , asking probing and thoughtful questions, and having a genuine concern for the client&rsquo;s well-being. It establishes a deep sense of belonging and acceptance.</p><p> For most financial advisors, the capacity and skills to understand someone deeply are not intuitive. They need to be acquired by learning and especially by experientially applying the principles of Motivational Interviewing, Appreciative Inquiry, and Positive Psychology. This training is rarely part of financial planning or finance programs.</p><h3> 4. Vulnerability.</h3><p> This was the most surprising quality listed for a leader. My image of a leader is that of a General Patton or President Lincoln: strong, resolved, visionary, courageous. Not vulnerable. Yet, in truth, vulnerability requires incredible strength of character, vision, and courage.</p><p> Financial advisors who are comfortable with their vulnerability are able to expose their humanity and failings. All of us can relate to someone who has screwed up. None of us can relate to someone who hasn&rsquo;t. Planners willing to admit their errors beget trust and confidence in those around them. The strength to be vulnerable cannot be acquired academically; it comes from spending a lot of time in self-reflection and personal growth.</p><p> Of the four qualities people look for in a strong leader, only one, expertise, can be learned academically. The other three&mdash;skill as a guide, deep understanding, and vulnerability&mdash;are learned experientially. If you&rsquo;re looking for a comprehensive, client-centered planner, keep in mind that someone with academic qualifications such as a masters in financial planning, a CFP&reg;, or a ChFC, has gained only 25% of the skills you may want. Someone who adds a degree in counseling conceivably has 50% of the skills.</p><p> To find a planner who can become a trusted leader and advisor, look further. Such advisors need to develop and apply in their own lives the relationship skills and leadership they offer to clients.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-25 21:44:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-25 21:44:20.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_j67mOCt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/surprising-leadership-qualities-financial-planning-clients-look-for/\", \"post_id\": \"4981\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-25 21:44:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-25 21:44:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"surprising-leadership-qualities-financial-planning-clients-look-for\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4980\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2241\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-25-at-2.59.27-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"495\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437994800,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

Unhappy clients have a plethora of choices from dispute resolution schemes and professional bodies complaints processes, through to litigation.   In each of these domains somebody, or a group of somebodies, must assess what is at the heart of the client&rsquo;s unhappiness.  Is it the result of product non-performance? Is it simply an unwanted, but not unanticipated, market aberration?  Is it because the adviser missed the mark and didn&rsquo;t provide an appropriate solution? Is human error or pure negligence responsible?</p><p> Regardless of the forum for the dispute, and regardless of the essence of the client complaint there is a key question that lies at the heart of determining whether the adviser has done the job to a satisfactory standard or not:</p><h3> Why was the advice appropriate for the client at that time?</h3><p> <br/> The adviser responsibility essentially swings upon establishing a suitable course of action after taking into account the clients circumstances, instructions, and the range of appropriate choices.  It is about suitability.</p><p> An adverse market outcome is not necessarily a shortcoming on the part of the adviser or the advice if it was understood to be one of the range of possible outcomes, and accepted as such.  Non-coverage of an insurable event is not negligence on the part of an adviser if a deliberate decision to ignore that possibility was made by the client.</p><p> The secondary question therefore that establishes a defensible advice process is:</p><h3> Can you evidence why it was suitable?</h3><p> <br/> These two relatively straightforward questions are the ones that will ultimately determine whether advice passes the test of objective professionalism.

The ranks of tech entrepreneurs are being staffed with all races and ethnicities, and women have emerged as powerful moguls in all areas of business. Teenagers and college students have been forming billion-dollar app companies, and Third World countries have even stepped it up as successful IT business incubators.</p><p> In 2015, the nontraditional entrepreneur is more empowered to make their vision a reality, especially in the world of high tech. Let&rsquo;s take a peek at some of the trends that are changing the traditional image of who&rsquo;s a tech mogul.</p><h3> Women: Kick-Start Your Start-Ups</h3><p> <br/> According to a 2014 white paper by  <u>  Dow Jones </u> , women&rsquo;s technology ventures are the hottest investments on Kickstarter.  <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kickstarter  </u>    </a> is the fundraising site where backers are invited to put cash into a plethora of projects, often in exchange for rewards.</p><p> Despite the fact that only 8% of women serve as CEOs of venture-backed companies, they continue to outpace men in raising funds for gaming and technology start-ups on this platform. In fact, women are 13% more likely to meet their Kickstarter financial goals than men. Dow Jones says that is primarily because these women-owned ventures are attracting the support of other women.</p><p> The average women-sponsored technology campaign on Kickstarter raises around $90,000. That&rsquo;s a drop in the bucket when compared to venture capitalist companies, which raise $600,000 to $3 million in their initial funding efforts. However:</p><li> 90% of the women with successful Kickstarter technology campaign projects were still afloat 18 months later</li><li> One-third of them reported revenues of at least $100,000 <br/>  </li><p> That&rsquo;s a powerful argument for putting your money where the girls are.</p><p> Another cash cow for start-up projects,  <u>  Crowdfunding </u> , says this about its female users:</p><li> They are 61% more likely to meet their financial targets</li><li> They make up 41% of the small business, technology, and other campaigns that meet their overall financial goals on the site <br/>  </li><p> While women still only sit on 17% of the Fortune 500 boards, women like Carrie Hammer are making waves as technology entrepreneurs. Carrie was named to the 15 Female Entrepreneurs to Watch in 2015 by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241760\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Entrepreneur  </a> </u>  magazine. Hammer is making tech news in 2015 by launching the first 3-D body scanner to track human fitness metrics, including BMI and body volume.</p><p> Other tech savvy women making the list include:</p><li> Kit Hickey, co-founder of  <u>  <a href=\"http://ministryofsupply.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ministry of Supply  </a> </u> , a technology-based men&rsquo;s clothing line that helps regulate body temperature</li><li> Laura Costa, CEO of Prima-temp, whose technology monitors core body temperature to help with sleep loss, disease detection, and fertility <br/>  </li><p> These are just some of the women casting aside traditional molds to create new technology in the marketplace. But they&rsquo;re not the only ones.</p><h3> Too Young to Vote: Start a Business Instead</h3><p> <br/> Technology entrepreneurship isn&rsquo;t just for adult women. Check out Vivienne Harr, Chief Inspiration Officer at  <u>  <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/a-10-year-olds-journey-from-lemonade-stand-to-silicon-valley/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   Make a Stand  </a> </u> . Make a Stand has a new mobile app that helps you launch fundraising campaigns for charity</p><p> Vivienne has experience raising funding for projects like this; she raised more than $100,000 for a human rights nonprofit. That may not sound like a lot of cash, but she did it by selling lemonade. She is, after all, just 10 years old.</p><p> At 15, Catherine Cook created  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.meetme.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   myYearbook.com  </a> </u> , a social networking site that allows teens to meet new people and play games. In 2010, they had $23 million in global revenue. In 2014, the company merged with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/201205/liz-welch/catherine-cook-and-geoff-cook-myyearbook.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Quepasa  </a> </u> , a publicly traded company that offers social networking sites for Latinos. It was a $100 million deal ... which we are pretty certain was just enough for Catherine to go to college at Georgetown.</p><h3> Forget &ldquo;Third World Country&rdquo;: Come in First in Innovation</h3><p> <br/> These days, Anesi and Osine Ikhianosime are typical teenagers. Ages 13 and 15 respectively, they live in Lagos, Nigeria. They&rsquo;re concerned about all the typical teenage things &mdash; soccer, friends and also ... coding, technology, and creating a faster mobile web browser. Called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bet.com/news/national/2015/06/08/nigerian-teenagers-create-popular-web-browser.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Crocodile Browser Lite  </a> </u> , it&rsquo;s being hailed by tech geeks as faster than Google Chrome, especially on non-smartphones.</p><p> This teenage duo are self-taught coders, using educational websites such like  <u>  Code Avengers </u>  to create Crocodile Browser Lite that critics are hailing as the best mobile app on the market. Anesi and Osine are planning on attending MIT &mdash; so it&rsquo;s safe to safe they&rsquo;re just getting started as tech entrepreneurs.</p><p> From teenagers in Lagos to business incubators in Nairobi, the African continent is abuzz with tech entrepreneurship. In early 2014,  <u>  <a href=\"http://news.microsoft.com/2013/10/24/microsoft-enters-into-cooperation-agreements-to-accelerate-african-innovation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Microsoft  </a> </u>  announced three partnerships with African incubators focused on tech business development, increased access to software, skills development, and capital investment in start-up companies. The partnership &ldquo;will support the development of sustainable and scalable working environments across the continent, such as technology hubs and incubation centers, to stimulate entrepreneurship and support African startups.&rdquo;</p><p> Some of the  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2014/02/04/30-most-promising-young-entrepreneurs-in-africa-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   top innovators  </u>    </a> in the country include:</p><li> 26-year-old Julie Alexander Fourie from South Africa, founder of iFix, a company that repairs and services all Apple products</li><li> Nigerian Uche Pedro, who, at age 29, founded BellaNaija, a new media company that delivers streaming content to audiences around the country</li><li> Isaac Oboth, the founder of Media256, a film and television production company in East Africa</li><li> And ClaimSync founder, Seth Akumani, from Ghana. Claim Sync offers claims processing software that enables hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities around the world to process electronic claims and automate patient records <br/>  </li><p> The times, they are a-changin&rsquo;, and in the world of tech start-ups, they&rsquo;re evolving in a very positive direction for the nontraditional entrepreneur. Advancements in technologies, education, and the creation of new fundraising outlets have changed the look of these businesses.</p><p> More and more companies are creating opportunities for a wider audience of entrepreneurs. Organizations such as  <a href=\"http://www.code2040.org/mission/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   CODE2040  </u>    </a> are specifically geared toward creating opportunities for Black and Latino tech entrepreneurs.  <u>  <a href=\"http://women2.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Women 2.0  </a> </u>  focuses on educating and creating networking opportunities for female tech entrepreneurs.

{"original_id":2196,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"#Startups—Do You Need a Board of Advisors?","link":"startups-do-you-need-a-board-of-advisors","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Much confusion exists with regard to the board of advisors, mostly concerning its role and responsibilities. </strong> For the most part, the board of advisors is an optional body of outside advisors that exists solely at the discretion of the CEO. Unlike the board of directors, the board of advisors has no legal liabilities for its advice to the CEO or company. This lack of legal liability can sometimes foster healthy and free-flowing exchanges of useful information. A board of advisors does not replace or compete with the regular board of directors. A suitable size for the advisory board is three to five members.</p><h3> A board of advisors is established to provide advice and knowledge in specific areas.</h3><p> <br/> For example, the board of advisors of a company mostly involved in providing financial services may wish to establish a financial board of advisors comprised of people with special skills and knowledge in, for instance, accounting, law, exchange rates, international financial matters, etc. Of course, technology companies would be advantaged by choosing technical advisory board members with strong backgrounds in pertinent areas of technology, product design, manufacturing, etc. An ideal board of advisors would have experience and knowledge in areas that the company anticipates encountering in the near future or the next stage. The ability of the executive team to tap into others who have &ldquo;done that before&rdquo; can be invaluable.</p><p> <strong>  An advisory board member should not simply be looked at as an unpaid consultant; </strong> rather, the advisory board member should be of a caliber and personality that can make a difference to the company because of his/her special experience, knowledge, skills, abilities, etc. The amount of time devoted to the duties of board members is typically minimal if unpaid, and often, the only requirement is for the board members to facilitate contact with other people and provide specific advice within their areas of expertise. In their capacity as advisory board members, they may be expected to take calls from the CEO, CTO, or CFO in regard to particular issues they could be expected to answer directly or, with a little time, provide answers or direction. The board of advisors may take on larger issues involving more of their time, often working as a team to reduce the workload to any single member.</p><p> There are no particular rules or procedures followed by a board of advisors. Formal meetings are not typically required, although a once-a-year meeting and dinner would be wise to express appreciation, promote camaraderie, and allow the CEO (and other executives) to outline the company&rsquo;s strategic plans and needs related to their advisory purpose.</p><p> As with the board of directors, the advisory board members can be compensated for their contributions and availability through the provision of stock options. As a rough guide, the board of advisors could be considered as equivalent to a quarter of a key person, but that depends a great deal upon what is being asked of them. If more is expected, then compensation should be correspondingly increased. If the board of advisors has extraordinary requirements placed on them involving significant work or time, then paid compensation (in addition to stock options) should be considered.</p><p> Members of the advisory board must not have conflicts of interest and must be prepared to sign confidentiality and noncompetition agreements. Their length of service is determined by mutual agreement; however, a specific short &ldquo;standard&rdquo; term that is renewable may work best for both the company and the advisory board member so as to permit the CEO to have flexibility in retaining an advisory board member, or not, and changing the specific attributes of the board over time.</p><p> People enlisted to be on the board of advisors are, or should be, people who have an interest in the business or technology and would like to contribute their special advice with the ultimate desire to be a small but important part of a successful enterprise. <strong>  The pool of candidate advisors should not include family members or anyone with an emotional or financial interest in the company (apart from stock options) unless there is a justifiable reason. </strong></p><p> The advisory board reflects the needs of the CEO and executive management team, and its ability to contribute is directly a function of how much effort is put into the relationship.

I mean think about your own purchases &ndash; whether you&rsquo;re in the market for a new car, a new house, or even a dinner out with the family &ndash; what&rsquo;s the one common component of your own buying decisions? <strong>  Budget, right? </strong></p><p> So it makes sense that all of your prospects have a budget consideration as well. But be careful because the price objection doesn&rsquo;t always mean that your prospect can&rsquo;t afford it. In fact, the price objection is often the biggest smokescreen objection of all &ndash; meaning that prospects throw it out to hide what the real objection is. And the reason they use it is because it works: again, everyone understands budget concerns because we all have them&hellip;</p><h3> Top producers know how to go beyond this smokescreen objection and uncover what the real objection is.</h3><p> <br/> And once you understand what the price objection really means, you will gain a unique insight into how to deal with and overcome it. Here are five &lsquo;hidden meanings&rsquo; your prospect doesn&rsquo;t want to reveal when they tell you that your price is too high &ndash; and what you should do about them:</p><h3> 1) They don&rsquo;t see the value in what you are selling. </h3><p> Often when a prospect tells you that the price is too high, what they&rsquo;re really saying is that based on what you&rsquo;re telling them they&rsquo;re getting, they don&rsquo;t feel the spend is justified. This often means that you either:</p><p> a. Didn&rsquo;t completely understand their buying motives and so didn&rsquo;t show how your solution addresses them, or: <br/> b. You didn&rsquo;t build enough value in the results they are going to get as a result of making the purchase.</p><p> <strong>  Solution:  </strong> After you&rsquo;ve clarified that this indeed the case, then it is up to you to go back and build that value by pitching specific points and tying them down to make sure your prospect sees and buys in to the value.</p><h3> 2) They believe they can get it cheaper somewhere else. </h3><p> With the Internet making your solution available to nearly anyone &ndash; or a solution your prospect thinks is the same &ndash; it&rsquo;s difficult to compete on price.</p><p> <strong>  Solution:  </strong> The solution here is in first discovering that your prospect has another option in mind and then doing the straight forward comparison of &ldquo;services for services.&rdquo; This used to be called an &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; close and it&rsquo;s still highly effective &ndash; if it&rsquo;s presented correctly. The key, however, is to be able to determine whether that&rsquo;s the issue and then use a properly worded script do the comparison.</p><h3> 3) They actually can get it cheaper somewhere else. </h3><p> This can seem difficult to at first handle, because after all if they can get it cheaper somewhere else, why wouldn&rsquo;t they do it?</p><p> <strong>  Solution: </strong>  To answer this question, just ask yourself what motivates you to pay a premium for a product or service you know you could get less expensively elsewhere. Reasons can include:</p><p> a. Getting it from a more well-known source often means that handling any problems, questions or returns is easier. <br/> b. Buying something from a person or company you respect or like is often another reason to go with a higher priced item. <br/> c. Convenience: Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier or less time consuming to buy a product or service from a source you know and trust &ndash; even if you have to pay a bit more. <br/> d. Quality of product. Often times a knock off or generic product is available, but those sometimes don&rsquo;t come with all the support, instructions, warranty, etc., that you can get buy paying a bit more from the manufacturer. <br/> e. You. The only place your customer can get you &ndash; your knowledge, your customer support, your belief and your desire to stand behind your product and make any problems right &ndash; is by buying it from your company and doing business with you. This is a powerful buying reason and one sales reps routinely underestimate&hellip;</p><h3> 4) Price is just a smokescreen hiding other objections. </h3><p> Often times prospects are not ready or willing to move forward with a purchase for a host of different reasons: If they are a business, then initiatives can change, or personnel changes, timing, scheduling, etc., also affect purchases. Or, for both individuals and companies, there can be multiple decision makers with different objectives, or prospects decide to keep looking or delay or postpone the decision for many other reasons as well.</p><p> When prospects don&rsquo;t want to reveal what is really stopping them from making a decision, they will often just throw out the price objection because it works. Revealing anything else would require an explanation, but saying it costs too much, or that they simply can&rsquo;t afford it, usually gets sales people off their back.</p><p> <strong>  Solution: </strong>  The key here is to find a way to get your prospects to reveal what is really behind their decision not to buy and then effectively deal with that.</p><h3> 5) They actually can&rsquo;t afford it. </h3><p> Sometimes the price objection is just as it sounds: your prospect can&rsquo;t afford &ndash; or chooses not to afford &ndash; your product or service. If this turns out to be the case, then it&rsquo;s something you should have addressed during qualifying.</p><p> <strong>  Solution: </strong>  Top producers always qualify for budget &ndash; among five other things &ndash; and they know in advance if a prospect can afford their solution. If you have qualified correctly in the beginning, and you still get the price objection, then you can be sure it&rsquo;s a smokescreen hiding items one through four above.</p><p> As you can see, the price objection isn&rsquo;t always about the price, but rather, it often means something else. Your job as a closer is to be prepared with a scripted approach to find out exactly what the real reason is, and so position yourself to overcome it.</p><p> If you would like some scripts to help you uncover what your prospects mean when you get the price objection, then  <u>  <a href=\"https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3031024072291266306\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sign Up  </a> </u>  Here for our brand new Webinar: <strong>  &ldquo;How to Overcome the Price Objection.&rdquo; </strong></p> ","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-25 15:17:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-25 15:17:58.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_UFU52F6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-the-price-objection-really-means/\", \"post_id\": \"4973\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-25 15:17:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-25 15:17:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-the-price-objection-really-means\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4972\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2237\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-25-at-3.09.35-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"519\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438027200,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2194,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Find an M&A Adviser without a Conflict of Interest","link":"how-to-find-an-ma-adviser-without-a-conflict-of-interest","source_link":null,"content":"<p> For over 15 years, I advised clients as a lawyer in complex business transactions. <strong>  My key advice was consistent, no matter the particulars of the business relationship: Make sure everyone&rsquo;s incentives are aligned. </strong></p><p> Following this basic rule is the best way to avoid conflicts of interest while hiring an M&amp;A adviser to sell your company. There are many different types of advisers and a host of issues to consider when hiring one, but if you create a relationship that aligns your incentives with your adviser&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ll minimize the chances for trouble later.</p><h3> Comparing Your Goals to Those of Your Adviser</h3><p> <br/> The first step is to look at what your interests are and how they differ from those of your adviser.</p><p> If you have chosen to sell or recapitalize your company, your goal is most likely to generate the highest after-tax value for your company. However, this simple sounding goal is more complex than you might initially think. Is your goal to create the highest value today or the highest value over time? Do you want to stay in the business or retire? What are the tax ramifications of various structures?</p><p> In contrast, your potential adviser&rsquo;s goal is pretty straightforward. He would like to generate the greatest possible amount of fees over the shortest amount of time. Because ultimately, advisers are selling their time, there is an important tradeoff to consider between fees generated by one transaction vs. fees generated overall.</p><h3> Retainer or Not?</h3><p> <br/> Generally, there are two components to an M&amp;A adviser&rsquo;s fee: an upfront retainer and a success fee.</p><p> I believe that a success-fee only model is the better way to align a business owner&rsquo;s incentives with his adviser&rsquo;s. As a business owner, you are retaining an adviser to sell or recapitalize your company. If your adviser succeeds by helping you achieve those goals, then you should be ecstatic to pay him! But, if he doesn&rsquo;t, then what has he delivered? Why would you pay him? And certainly, why would you pay him a fee upfront before he has done anything for you?</p><h3> But, the Adviser Needs Certainty as Well</h3><p> <br/> While I don&rsquo;t believe that retainers serve business owners well, there is a tradeoff to asking advisers to take risk. They&rsquo;ll want to make sure that your incentives are aligned with theirs as well. If you would like not to pay a retainer, don&rsquo;t be surprised if an adviser asks you for a significant exclusive period and a period of time after the exclusive period ends where their work is protected, and for other similar risk sharing mechanisms.</p><h3> Success Fee Percentages</h3><p> <br/> Historically, success fees have tiered downward as the value of a transaction increases. However, it is important to recognize the possible conflict this creates. Often, for large transactions, the incremental fee for the last dollars of the purchase price in a large deal is very small (1% to 2%).   The question this should raise for a business owner is whether this incremental fee incents the adviser to get the best deal. From an adviser&rsquo;s perspective, why push too hard for another million in purchase price if it will only generate another $10,000 in fees. Better to close the deal and move on to the next deal. Consider what the right incentive structure is for the transaction you are doing.</p><h3> The Conflict You Can&rsquo;t Avoid</h3><p> <br/> No matter how well you align yourself with your adviser, you&rsquo;ll never be able to avoid the final conflict &ndash; your adviser gets paid when your transaction closes. Consequently, at some point, his incentive will be advise you to complete the transaction, regardless of other considerations. At this stage, while you have hopefully established a trusting relationship with your M&amp;A adviser, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that you have other advisers that aren&rsquo;t similarly incented (e.g., your lawyer and/or your accountant).</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-24 19:45:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-24 19:45:55.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_TqzYCuW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-find-an-ma-adviser-without-a-conflict-of-interest/\", \"post_id\": \"4971\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-24 19:45:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-24 19:45:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-find-an-ma-adviser-without-a-conflict-of-interest\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4970\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2234\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-24-at-12.47.45-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"478\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437996600,"author_id":345,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2192,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Successful Executives Manage Worry","link":"how-successful-executives-manage-worry","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Worry is a killer&mdash;over time it harms our health and emotional well-being. </strong> It doesn&rsquo;t solve problems, nor does it make us better, faster, or more effective. Yet studies have shown our capacity to worry evolved in tandem with our intelligence.</p><h3> That means we&rsquo;re going to worry.</h3><p> <br/> So what do successful people do to manage their worry? Having assessed and coached many executives over the last decade, I&rsquo;ve seen some great worry-management habits that are worth sharing. Here they are:</p><h3> They Recognize That Worry is Optional and Manageable</h3><p> <br/> If you believe worry is something that &ldquo;happens to&rdquo; you, and that you have little or no influence over it, then it will be an ongoing problem for your health and well-being. Worry is the product of each of our unique patterns of negative thinking that has become habitual over the years. Look at any baby and realize that chronic worry is not &ldquo;original equipment.&rdquo; When you recognize this, you discover that those patterns, like a document or spreadsheet, are subject to editing with some deliberate, sustained conscious efforts by you, as outlined in the suggestions that follow.</p><h3> When a Worry Crops Up, They Catch it and &ldquo;Give it the Day Off&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> To manage worry, it&rsquo;s important to catch it in the act and shine the light of your awareness on it. Worries are gremlins lurking in the darkness of our unawareness, freely doing their damage.  That is until you flick on the light of your attention, as in &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m worrying about presenting at that meeting again.&rdquo; You can then take a few deep breaths and address the worry directly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving my worry about presenting at that meeting the rest of the day off.&rdquo; This usually does the trick, and repeated over time, can help with the pattern of worrying about presenting, for example.</p><h3> They &ldquo;Get&rdquo; Their Unique Pattern of Worry</h3><p> <br/> We tend to worry about certain types of things and not others. Our worry patterns are as unique as fingerprints&mdash;maybe you worry about conflicts, health, making mistakes, presenting, etc. Pay attention to yours and you will see your own patterns; the better you know them, the better you can manage them. The very fact that you worry about A types of things, and not B types of things is further proof that worrying is optional.</p><h3> They Get Enough Rest</h3><p> <br/> Rest is important in so many ways for health and well-being, including managing worry. Yet we are an under-rested, hyper-connected global society of 24/7. Being less rested amplifies worries. I notice I worry more when I&rsquo;m tired. Because it&rsquo;s impossible to avoid days when we lack rest, it&rsquo;s good to remember that our worries on those days may be higher than normal. I&rsquo;ve learned to tell myself when I&rsquo;m tired-worrying that &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m worrying because I&rsquo;m tired, so I&rsquo;m calling a time out to the worry until I rest.&rdquo; Get your rest!</p><h3> They Dismiss Worry&rsquo;s Potential Positive Value</h3><p> <br/> If you think your worries keep you sharp, motivated, or productive, join the club&mdash;that&rsquo;s a huge reason people hang on to worrying behaviors even though they know better. I&rsquo;ve heard it from my executive coaching clients. Successful leaders realize that they didn&rsquo;t get there because of their worry, but despite it, and decide at some point that worry is simply more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.</p><h3> They Develop Their Own Ways to Manage It</h3><p> <br/> For some, mindfulness meditation, exercise, or other zen-like activities work best. For others, keeping track of worries in their journal is the key. Some even limit their worry to a specific block of time each week, and dismiss it at all other times. The point here is that successful people take worry-management seriously, and develop healthy habits in terms of how they manage it&mdash;ones that fit their personality and style.</p><p> Take your worry management seriously (but don't worry too much about it!). It&rsquo;s important that you recognize how much of your time you spend worrying, and the extent to which you let your worries manage you, versus you manage them, and use these suggestions to minimize your worries which can&rsquo;t help but improve your health and well-being</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-24 17:54:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-24 17:54:27.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_cdpvJJ8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-successful-executives-manage-worry/\", \"post_id\": \"4967\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-24 17:54:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-24 17:54:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-successful-executives-manage-worry\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4966\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2232\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-25-at-3.13.14-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"396\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438000200,"author_id":131,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2191,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"I Went Viral! I Didn't Go Viral! Lessons From 1 Year on LinkedIn's Pulse","link":"i-went-viral-i-didnt-go-viral-lessons-from-1-year-on-linkedins-pulse","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My  <u>  first post on Pulse </u>  trended to 90k+ reads.  <u>  My second post </u>  above 20k. One of my more recent posts had  <u>  218 reads </u> . Welcome to my year long publishing experiment on Linkedin's Pulse, which is now up over a million writers btw. </p><h3> For those of you considering how you might be part of the push to 2 million writers, these are a few of the things I've observed in that time:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Snappy headlines are good, but you're fooling yourself if you think you can predict what people will respond to. </strong> I've read the advice posts about headlines, viewed the data about best times to publish and keywords that draw best response rates and they're all totally valid except for when they're not. And that's the whole point of creating content. You can't know what's going to resonate and what won't. Nor do you have visibility in real-time to effect any kind of A/B testing. So you're left with luck. Timing. A great picture. Your writing. And maybe more luck. Welcome to the joy of creating.</p><p> <strong>  2. Pulse is first and foremost about entertainment. </strong> That's not meant as a criticism, rather an observation. People may be on LI for a lot of different reasons, but the reality is that they've got a limited amount of time and want to cover a lot of ground. Your white paper on whatever subject may be awesome; but, in my experience, \"education\" posts do not draw readers the way entertainment does. </p><p> <strong>  3. Distribution is everything. </strong> Absolutely tweet to tips @LinkedInPulse. If your post doesn't get featured, no one's going to see it. Of course, even if your post does get featured, that doesn't mean that you'll get read by anyone. And, to that end, just because you tweet to @LinkedInPulse about your post, that doesn't mean you'll get featured, regardless. But tweeting's the best you can hope for. Bottom-line: you and a million others are hoping to be read and shared. I've seen a fair bit of complaining about this in some of the writer groups. Here's the reality: If you're not an influencer,  your part of the firehose of content. There's some opacity in the system. Deal with it.</p><p> <strong>  4. Have I mentioned there's a flood of content? </strong> I've observed a steady decline in the number of total reads of my posts (along with everyone else's) over time, surely a victim of the flood. Even if it trends, since you're not an influencer, your Pulse post will have a very short tail - 24 hours at best, and then it's going to fall into the great void that is the internet. Which means that a) you shouldn't waste too much time writing the perfect article;  b) you should focus more on writing more often; and most importantly, c) you should have realistic expectations about what success looks like.</p><p> <strong>  5. Speaking of which, define success ahead of time. </strong> This is a strategy no-brainer, but it's frequently overlooked by a lot of people. I have had lots of interesting and cool people connect with me after reading one of my posts. After my post about lying to James Cameron, I got INMAIL messages from people THANKING me for sharing the truth of their work experiences. For me, that was an awesome success point - if only because, as one person stated, INMAIL's cost money! Or the time I was at a client giving a workshop and one of the participants pulled me aside to tell me how much they agreed with me about  <u>  Millennials </u>  (336 reads). Success. A friend read my post on  <u>  Interviewing </u>  right before she had her own interview, and she said it helped her be more mindful of sitting forward and showing engagement in her interview. Success!</p><p> So there you have it. Should you be publishing on Pulse? If you enjoy writing, yes. Will it make you famous? Unlikely. Is it satisfying professionally? I can tell you that having 90k+ reads is more fun than having 100. <strong>  Will it get you work? Uh.... </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-24 17:31:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-24 17:31:09.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_UXe8W0l.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/i-went-viral-i-didnt-go-viral-lessons-from-1-year-on-linkedins-pulse/\", \"post_id\": \"4964\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-24 17:31:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-24 17:31:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"i-went-viral-i-didnt-go-viral-lessons-from-1-year-on-linkedins-pulse\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4965\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2231\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1432850252397-8be919d9ba23-copy_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"599\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438016400,"author_id":275,"chart_url":""}

You know it&rsquo;s your sweet spot when it feels easy and you feel at your best&mdash;nothing else matters while you are in your zone. Remember the last time you experienced this? You were the master of your universe and it felt pretty damned amazing&mdash;right?</p><p> Yet somehow, when it comes to tending to your financial life, you may feel quite the opposite of mastery. You may well have limited knowledge&mdash;and if you&rsquo;re like lots of people, you either avoid the situation to the greatest degree possible OR find someone you trust and hope for the best. Neither scenario is truly comforting. And deep down, you admit to yourself that other than paying bills, setting up your 401(k) plan and gathering tax information for your annual misery session, you really have very little comfort in this area. </p><h3> Your financial life becomes the opposite of being in your groove. But considering the confusion, complexity and corruption in the financial industry&mdash;why should you feel comfortable?</h3><p> <br/> Take Sean. He&rsquo;s a single 36 year old who earns a pretty decent living, but is far from set. Sitting in the middle of his cash flow statement was a significant outflow in the insurance category. When asked, he said that he was advised to buy a whole life insurance policy that would grow to a large amount in the future. Probing further, I discovered that Sean had no disability insurance, a tiny emergency fund and while he said he wanted to buy a condo in the next few years, had put very little toward that goal.</p><p> Sean&mdash;not knowing even what to ask&mdash;was &ldquo;featured and benefitted&rdquo; into buying an expensive policy even though he had absolutely no need for that coverage. He was told that the policy would accrue tax deferred and he could get the money any time. And of course the illustration he was shown displayed spectacular results. Meanwhile, he was paying out thousands of dollars for something he didn&rsquo;t need.</p><p> Sean trusted the agent and frankly was too intimidated to probe too deeply. His lack of knowledge led him to bad decisions and even farther away from getting his money to work best for him.</p><p> To get into your financial groove, pick one area where you have concerns and make a simple plan. The key? Start small and start strong.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s say you want to build up your savings. How can you start small and strong? <br/>  </h3><li> Examine your monthly expenses.</li><li> Pick out ONE or TWO areas where you have some control (also known as discretionary expenses&mdash;things like eating out or the cable bill).</li><li> Decide what you are going to cut out or cut back and quantify what that means in a dollar amount. For example, if you decide that you can do without the $5 coffee three times a day and opt instead to make coffee at home, you can save $15 per day.</li><li> At the end of each day, transfer $15 from your checking account to your savings or money market (or if you&rsquo;re still writing checks, write the check). At the end of the workweek, you should have a $75 increase in your savings and $300 at the end of the month.</li><li> Follow your progress each week and each month. After two months, you should have this habit down pat.</li><li> Now, look for other opportunities that can push your savings to an even greater level.</li><li> Make sure you are engaging in both sides of the transactions: not spending andactively <br/>  </li><h3> Nothing breeds success like success.</h3><p> <br/> Pretty soon, making sound financial decisions becomes easier because you started small and then expanded your capabilities. No world-class marathoner began running 26 miles at a lightning pace.</p><p> Getting into your money groove follows the same idea. One step at a time, you&rsquo;re always expanding your comfort zone with experience and understanding. All you need is the willingness to take the first step.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-24 16:44:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-24 16:44:46.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Demv0Vo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/get-into-your-money-groove/\", \"post_id\": \"4962\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-24 16:44:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-24 16:44:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"get-into-your-money-groove\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4961\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2230\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1435214581984-cc580b4758e2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"801\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1438023600,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

There are many memories of time spent pounding the pavement; not the least of which is that when I looked down, I slowed down, when I looked up, I sped up.These thoughts returned as I rambled through my summer reading, which included finding two references to the concept of getting to the balcony.Consultant Bob Greene writes that when in the midst of conflict, it may be time to go to the balcony. He writes, &ldquo;The balcony is a metaphor for a mental attitude of detachment. From the balcony you can calmly evaluate the conflict almost as if you were a third party.&rdquo; <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a> In a similar vein, Ronald A. Heifetz and Marty Linsky observe that, &ldquo;In order to remain effective when under attack, a leader must be able to get some distance from the challenging situation&mdash;by going to the balcony.&rdquo; <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [2] </a> These suggestions bring to mind a time when I was asked to be a judge at a business school strategy case competition. By use of a metaphor, I had observed that a particular team had developed and presented the perfect means of surviving and finding their way through a thick jungle&mdash;but no one had thought to climb the highest tree to determine that the jungle would end in a few hundred yards, only to be replaced by a desert!</p><h3> Among the attributes of successful leadership is vision. Vision requires perspective.</h3>When we allow ourselves to break away from the fray; to go&mdash;literally or figuratively&mdash;to a higher place, we can contemplate the end-state of what we are in the middle of now. We can look down on our work, not as a work in progress, but as a completed whole. We can stand downstream from a decision we are about to take and see that decision from that downstream place, and through that lens we can &lsquo;see&rsquo; if it has turned out the way we had hoped it would. We can see prospective paths to a solution that are not necessarily immediately visible from ground level.This conscious separation of oneself from the moment-to-moment demands of our work is not a luxury, but an absolute necessity. In fact we owe it to our organizations and stakeholders to do it. So, use some down time this summer to gain elevation &ndash; it may change your perspective. This may be one of the most critical changes in behaviour when moving into leadership &ndash; letting go of those activities which are no longer your job, and focussing on the bigger picture.<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1]</a>http://tsne.org/first-step-resolving-conflict-go-balcony<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [2]</a>Heifetz and Linsky, Harvard Business Review, April 9th 2002.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2018-07-03 17:07:31.000000","last_updated":"2018-07-03 17:07:31.000000","image_url":"uploads/2018/07/10-questions-your-financial-adviser-should-ask-you.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/?p=4958\", \"post_id\": \"4958\", \"post_date\": \"2018-07-03 10:07:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2018-07-03 17:07:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"time-to-get-to-higher-ground\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"42179\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2228\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/potential-impact-sales-tax-internet-sales.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"657\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"298\", \"custom_permalink\": \"financial-podcasts/10-questions-your-financial-adviser-should-ask-you\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2018-07-10\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/09/stop-marketing-build-relationships-influencers/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"78\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://traffic.libsyn.com/andrewlacivita/TipsForWorkAndLife-011-The9FastestWaysToBeAwesomeAtYourCraft.mp3\\n0\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"wpcf-homeslideroption\": \"1\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskw_text_input\": \"performance review phrases\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437753180,"author_id":377,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2187,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Important Aspects Of Effective Lead Nurturing","link":"4-important-aspects-of-effective-lead-nurturing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Nigel Reid | <u>  Econnexx </u></p><h3> Lead Nurturing Is A Vital Element Of Client Acquisition For Financial Firms</h3><p> <br/> Lead generation is no longer solely about obtaining contact details so you can call a lead. It now involves nurturing leads through content processes that are designed to move them from curiosity stage to buyer ready stage, promoting a more effective and rewarding sales process.</p><p> Lead generation has moved away from a single event, to initiating and maintaining a relationship that leads the prospect to understanding their options and choosing you to help them achieve their needs.</p><p> Here are 4 things an effective lead nurturing strategy should have.</p><h3> 1. Persistence</h3><p> Persistence is important when dealing with today&rsquo;s overloaded consumers. Don&rsquo;t give up after a single follow up. It often takes 3-5 attempts to reach a prospect who showed interest via an ebook, whitepaper, or other inbound activity. Waiting for them to call you back will only let their interest go cold and leave room for someone else to capture the attention you invested in developing. Don&rsquo;t misinterpret their lack of immediate response as a lack of interest.</p><h3> 2. Value</h3><p> Create value with your messages, but don&rsquo;t over-inform. Sending content-heavy communication risks losing your prospects. The information they receive should be easy to digest and relevant, with each follow up message designed to further understanding and interest. The first time they read something they don&rsquo;t understand, it will distance them and make them think you aren&rsquo;t a good fit. If they see value in your messages and content they will be more open to receiving more. The more they choose to consume the more likely they are to respond positively to contact.</p><h3> 3. Personal Interaction</h3><p> Your nurturing program should be a deliberate effort to break down barriers with your prospects, inform them, and also build a personal relationship with them. The human aspect of this is important because it is the richest form of communication at your disposal. Interacting with your prospects through targeted, personalised messages will reinforce and advance the opportunity.</p><h3> 4. Timing</h3><p> Finally, timing is extremely critical in your follow up. Plan the delivery of your messages within the right timeframe. Buyers are open to early engagement, and this is often when the real window of influence is possible and decisions are made. So, with your prospects, take the approaches that align with your buyers' actual decision patterns.   </p><h3> Final Thought <br/>  </h3><p> The key with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/get-more-site-visitors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   lead nurturing  </a> </u>  is to do something that takes someone who has provided their contact details and advance their interest before making contact. A nurtured lead is therefore a much more advanced lead and someone who is more likely to take positive action.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 19:32:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 19:32:55.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_5XDmEjA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-important-aspects-of-effective-lead-nurturing/\", \"post_id\": \"4954\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 19:32:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 19:32:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-important-aspects-of-effective-lead-nurturing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4953\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2226\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437634309345-22b02c1ae995-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"651\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437824700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2186,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Shocking Truth about Why Most Financial Planners Fail Miserably at Helping Their Clients","link":"the-shocking-truth-about-why-most-financial-planners-fail-miserably-at-helping-their-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You&rsquo;re smart, motivated, and hard working. So you figure you have everything it takes to help people. Right?</p><p> Well, not quite.</p><p> To explain why, let&rsquo;s do a little quiz. Let&rsquo;s see how you do:</p><li> Name the five wealthiest people in the world</li><li> Name the last five winners of the Miss Universe contest</li><li> Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer Prize</li><li> Name the last half dozen Academy Award winners for best actor and actresses <br/>  </li><p> The point: These are not second-rate achievers. They are the best in their fields. Still, none of us remember these statistics. Why? Because the applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are forgotten. Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s another quiz. See how you do on this one:</p><li> Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time</li><li> Name three people who have taught you something worthwhile</li><li> Think of three people who have made you feel appreciated and special</li><li> Think of three people you enjoy spending time with <br/>  </li><p> Much easier, right?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the lesson:</p><h3> The people who make a difference in your life are not the ones with the most credentials, the most money or the most awards. They are the ones who care.</h3><p> <br/> So, let me ask you this: &ldquo;Do you care about your clients?&rdquo;</p><p> You answered this question with &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, didn&rsquo;t you?</p><p> So, if you care about your clients, how do you think you can help your clients most?</p><p> If you&rsquo;re like most planners, you&rsquo;ll say something like: &ldquo;I help my clients most by making sure they are reaching their financial goals&rdquo;.</p><p> The only problem?</p><p> You aren&rsquo;t sure if that&rsquo;s what your clients really care about.</p><p> Because while many expert planners preach the virtues of &ldquo;goal-based-planning&rdquo;,  <u>  almost nobody tells you that 97% of your customers don&rsquo;t even have financial goals </u> .</p><p> As a result, many well-intentioned planners believe they are helping their clients by spending their precious time and money on what they  think  their clients care about.</p><p> In reality?</p><p> They fail miserably.</p><h3> Why Most Financial Planners Are Terrible Helpers</h3><p> <br/> First some good news: it&rsquo;s not your fault.</p><p> Let me explain by telling you a little story about the human mind (and why you believe you are helping your clients)</p><p> Because conventional wisdom says that our brain has two independent systems at work at all times. Plato said that in our heads we have a rational charioteer who has to rein in an unruly horse that &ldquo;barely yields to horsewhip and goad combined.&rdquo;</p><p> Freud wrote about the selfish id and the conscientious superego. More recently, behavioral economists dubbed the two systems the Planner and the Doer.</p><p> And I, Ronald Sier, financial planner (and not even an amateur-psychologist), likes to call it left- and right brain. The left-brain is the rational, reflective, conscious side. It&rsquo;s the part that deliberates and analyzes and looks into the future. While the right-brain is instinctive and emotional, always looking for instant-gratification.</p><p> However, the best analogy that captures our left-and right-brain, is laid out in Dan and Chip Heath&rsquo;s bestseller  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385528752/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0385528752&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;linkId=XLSVATTSD5JLZJC3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard  </a> </u> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0385528752\"/> :</p><p> &ldquo;Imagine an Elephant. And on top of the Elephant sits a Rider. The Rider and the Elephant are like the human mind. Our rational left-brain is the Rider and our emotional right-brain is the Elephant. Perched atop the Elephant, the Rider holds the reins and seems to be the leader.</p><p> However, the Rider&rsquo;s control is precarious because the Rider is so small relative to the Elephant. Anytime the six-ton Elephant and the Rider disagree about which direction to go, the Rider is going to lose. He&rsquo;s completely overmatched.</p><p> Most of us are all too familiar in which our own Elephants overpower our Rider. You&rsquo;ve experienced it if you&rsquo;ve ever slept in, overeaten, dialed up your ex at midnight, procrastinated, tried to quit smoking and failed, or skipped the gym.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve also experienced it with your clients. You&rsquo;ve experienced it when they didn&rsquo;t follow up on your advice, procrastinated, wanted to buy stocks when prices are high, not saving for retirement and so on.</p><p> In those situations it&rsquo;s the weakness of the Elephant that overpowers the Rider. It&rsquo;s the emotional and instinctive side that takes control and ignores the Rider.&rdquo;</p><br /><p> Still, financial planners like to think, that when it comes to helping people, our job is to analyze, to plan for the future, to be rational. In other words, we believe our job is to appeal to people&rsquo;s Rider.</p><p> And then we leave it at that (which is terrible for truly helping people).</p><h3> But what about the Elephant?</h3><p> <br/> Because the truth is that the Rider simply can&rsquo;t keep the Elephant on the road long enough to reach the destination.</p><p> In other words: the financial planner simply can&rsquo;t keep his client engaged long enough to help reach their financial goals. Because the Elephant&rsquo;s hunger for instant gratification outweighs the Rider&rsquo;s strength, which is the ability to think long-term, to plan, to analyze.</p><p> But here&rsquo;s a surprise: although the Elephant&rsquo;s hunger for instant gratification is a problem, the Elephant also has enormous strengths.</p><p> The Elephant isn&rsquo;t always the bad guy. Emotion is the Elephant&rsquo;s turf &ndash; love and compassion. Sympathy and loyalty. That fierce instinct you have to protect your kids against harm &ndash; that&rsquo;s the Elephant.</p><p> While the Rider tends to overanalyze and overthink things,  <strong>  it&rsquo;s the Elephant who gets things done </strong> . If you want to help people to make progress toward their financial goals, it requires the energy and drive of the Elephant. While you help your client&rsquo;s Rider by giving them planning and direction, you also need to engage their Elephant to provide the energy.</p><p> If you really want to help people, you&rsquo;ve got to appeal to the Rider AND the Elephant</p><p> If you reach your client&rsquo;s Rider but not the Elephant, your clients will have understanding without motivation, compassion or emotion. If you reach their Elephants but not their Riders, they&rsquo;ll have passion without direction.</p><p> And while you are very good at engaging with your client&rsquo;s Rider, most planners still need to use their right-brain to engage with their client&rsquo;s Elephant.</p><h3> How to Motivate the Elephant</h3><br /><p> In the 1980s, a major study of corporate change efforts found that financial goals inspired successful change less effectively than more emotional goals did. One manager at a glass company suggested, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to get excited about 15% return on equity&rdquo;.</p><p> Yet, many financial planners believe that people are  motivated  by helping them to reach their financial goals. In looking for a goal that reaches the Elephant &ndash; that hits your clients in the gut &ndash; you can&rsquo;t bank on financial goals.</p><p> It&rsquo;s like climbing Mount Everest. Most mountain climbers&rsquo; goal is to reaching the top. But what really satisfies them is the enjoyment and the challenge.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why you need to remember this:</p><p> Financial goals presume the emotion; they don&rsquo;t generate it</p><p> And I hear you think: &ldquo;What does?&rdquo;</p><p> In &ldquo;the Heart of Change&rdquo; John Kotter and Dan Cohen say that most people think change happens in this order: ANALYZE &ndash; THINK &ndash; CHANGE. And I believe most financial planners think it works this way too.</p><p> Financial planners analyze &ndash;  your clients think  &ndash; and then they change.</p><p> And this works pretty well when parameters are known, and the future is not fuzzy.</p><p> But most of our clients&rsquo; situations don&rsquo;t look like that, especially not with entrepreneurs. In most of their situations their future is quite fuzzy.</p><p> And because of that uncertainty, the Elephant is reluctant to move, and analytical arguments will not overcome that reluctance. (If someone is unsure about whether to marry her significant other, you&rsquo;re not going to tip her by talking up tax advantages and rent savings).</p><p> Kotter and Cohen observed that, to motivate people, the sequence is not ANALYZE &ndash; THINK &ndash; CHANGE, but rather  <strong>  SEE &ndash; FEEL &ndash; CHANGE. </strong></p><p> You have to present your clients with some evidence that makes them feel something. It might be a disturbing look at the problem, or a hopeful glimpse of the solution. It has to be something that hits them at the emotional level. It has to be something that speaks to the Elephant.</p><p> But which feeling?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the answer: A  <strong>  positive </strong>  feeling.</p><p> Something like hope, happiness, enthusiasm, pride, love, joy.</p><p> Why? Because it turns out that &ndash; while negative emotions tend to have a &ldquo;narrowing&rdquo; effect on our thougts, positive emotions are designed to  broaden and build  people&rsquo;s repertoire of thoughts and actions. Joy, for example, makes people want to play. Play doesn&rsquo;t have a script, it  broadens  the kinds of things we consider doing. And because joy encourages us to play, we are  building  resources and skills.</p><p> In other words, people will be open to new ideas.</p><p> Think about it. The positive emotion of pride for example, experienced when we achieve a personal goal, broadens the kinds of tasks we contemplate for the future, encouraging us to pursue even bigger goals.</p><p> So, why don&rsquo;t you start motivating  your clients  to reach their financial goals?</p><p> Wouldn&rsquo;t that be the ultimate satisfaction as a helpful financial planner?</p><p> There are several options. You might want to experiment by asking different kind of questions to each and every client. But that can take a lot of time to figure out.</p><p> But if you want to use a proven worksheet that &ndash; regardless of the type of clients your serve &ndash; works to motivate them to reach their goals and to follow up on your advice, I have something for you. And it&rsquo;s FREE.</p><p> If you truly want to help your clients, the only thing you have to do is to answer the following question:</p><h3> What motivates YOU to be a financial planner?</h3>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 19:20:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 19:20:15.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_sXLUF7E.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-shocking-truth-about-why-most-financial-planners-fail-miserably-at-helping-their-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"4952\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 19:20:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 19:20:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-shocking-truth-about-why-most-financial-planners-fail-miserably-at-helping-their-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4951\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2225\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/298007480_dd214c727f.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1444\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437821100,"author_id":409,"chart_url":""}

For one thing, it's easy to start a conversation with just about anybody - unlike on LinkedIn where you have to be connected first (or pay for premium access). And casual tweets and conversations can often reveal far more about a person - or a brand - than the lengthier, more structured interactions that tend to take place on LinkedIn.</p><p> To my mind the power of Twitter can best be summed up in a single word: &lsquo;serendipity&rsquo;. The Oxford Dictionary defines serendipity as &lsquo;the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way&rdquo;. For me, that&rsquo;s what makes Twitter irreplaceable as a B2B business tool and explains how it has opened up countless great new connections over the years, including some of my best clients.</p><p> And the beauty of serendipity Twitter-style is that success doesn&rsquo;t just have to come down to dumb luck. As legendary golfer Gary Player once said, &lsquo;the harder I practise, the luckier I get&rsquo;, and this applies every bit as much to social media marketing as it does to sporting success.</p><p> The good news, of course, is that you don&rsquo;t have to choose between LinkedIn and Twitter. So if you work in B2B but have ignored Twitter until now on the basis that it&rsquo;s not worth your time and effort, isn't it high time you had a rethink? Once you do, I&rsquo;ll be astonished if it doesn&rsquo;t start bringing you the same sort of &lsquo;lucky&rsquo; breaks that Twitter fans like me have been enjoying for years.   </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 19:12:29.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 19:12:29.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_wKDeSgE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/this-could-be-your-lucky-dayif-you-give-twitter-serendipity-a-chance/\", \"post_id\": \"4950\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 19:12:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 19:12:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"this-could-be-your-lucky-dayif-you-give-twitter-serendipity-a-chance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4949\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2224\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/spades_kevinl8888_ncnd.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"642\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437757200,"author_id":492,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2184,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Build Your Ideal Client Profile Through Case Studies","link":"build-your-ideal-client-profile-through-case-studies","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Build case studies to help people identify their financial blind spots and your ideal client profile and help people understand your ideal client profile. Reading your case study will help your prospects understand potential financial blind spots and showcase your ability to solve those potential issues. <br/> <br/> Case studies can be simple or complex, but telling a story is one of the most effective ways to explain why you do what you do, what you do and how you do it. A case study explains the why, what and how as it relates to finding ideal clients. Here is a simple exercise to help find your ideal clients. Take your top ten clients and select one or two of them to write a case study or story about them (changing their names and confidential information of course, and make sure compliance has read it over). <br/> <br/> First, choose from a segment that you want to work in to find more ideal clients. For example, you can focus on wealthy retirees, successful entrepreneurs, corner office executives, professionals, wealthy families or other categories. Then choose one of your top ten clients from this category and start the story. Make sure it is a topic you are well versed in and most passionate about. It will make it easy to tell the story and become inspirational. For example, as an advisor I always shared the story of retirees and second marriages and how one couple found themselves in a very challenging estate and family situation, unaware of what to do if one of them passed away. I became known as a person to talk to about retirees and second marriages and estate planning challenges. As a result, I was referred to by several retirees with friends who were in their second marriage. The audience selection here is part of your ideal client profile. The segment that will most likely benefit from this advice is&hellip;? What does this segment usually pay to solve these problems? What groups, associations or other social gatherings do they frequent? <br/> <br/> Category: A wealthy retired couple ___________________________________________ <br/> Second, describe how you met. Did they get introduced by referral, meet you at an event or from a center of influence? Was it a seminar you did, or a fundraising event? Was it at the golf course? In other words, tell me how you meet people. Prospects want to know how to meet you. <br/> <br/> Introduction/Referral from an accountant ____________________________________ <br/> Third, describe the problem/issue(s) they were facing when they sought your advice. Each segment of clients has similar or common challenges they face. Describing the problem will help people identify what problems you solve. For example, a wealthy retired couple was bothered by a change in their health and worried about lifetime income if either had to spend a lot of money on health care. They were also worried about their estate. Now picture a healthy retired couple in their 60&rsquo;s who are faced with a rapid change in health, which could affect their finances, their estate and their family. They are no longer 100% confident in the plan and want a second opinion. <br/> <br/> My target segment wants to achieve&hellip;? Who do they pay good money for advice now and how much? Does it make sense? Describe the problem they have: worried about their nest egg, their income or their estate, for example. <br/> <br/> Fourth, what were the solutions you suggested to help overcome their problems? What is a story of obstacles or challenges that would resonate with your target segment? These stories will help people know that you understand their struggles. What were the results or potential results? For the example of the retired couple concerned about how rapid health challenges would affect their estate, we put a plan in place that included the following elements:</p><li> A written income plan for life, including health and mortality risks that they were comfortable with;</li><li> An estate plan developed in conjunction with their professional advisors, accountant and lawyer, which created a team strategy to give them a comfortable plan in writing for peace of mind for their family;</li><li> A family estate plan after meeting with their family, to understand them better and address their specific needs</li><p> <br/> With comprehensive and holistic planning, by asking the deeper questions and getting to understand our client&rsquo;s needs, they were able to accomplish what they wanted. They now have a clearly documented plan going forward. The plan can now be discussed and continually updated through our detailed progress meetings to continue to achieve the comfort they are seeking. <br/> <br/> Results: In writing, what is the potential outcome? ____________________________________ <br/> Now when you read the case study, do you see how another couple in a similar situation could read this and say, &ldquo;They understand us and our problems.&rdquo; If this is the type of work they do, maybe we should have a conversation with them and possibly achieve a similar result?</p><h3> What do your clients get?</h3><p> <br/> When a potential client sits down with you, your firm or your team, what do they get in writing? Do you have an example in writing like the case study above? Do you have a sample financial plan, investment plan or other related documents that you can share? What progress meeting summaries do you provide? Do you have all of the documents in one binder, to help keep track of the progress? As you can see, a case study is more than just a story; it is a test drive of the vehicle you want your client to buy. Let them feel it&mdash;attach emotion to it. And remember: sell the process, not the result. You have a process better than anyone else. Tell your potential clients about your unique and detailed process and tell it in a story that they can relate to and understand. <br/> <br/> Do you illustrate a simple case study with a look at the before and after results or do you tell a more detailed story? Ask your ideal clients to read your case studies and offer you feedback and context on how they would relate to the story. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Here is an easy exercise. </strong> Buddy up with another advisor and share your best case studies or stories with him or her and ask them to write it down. Then reverse roles and do the same. Most advisors can verbalize beautiful stories or cases when asked, but do not put it on paper.</p><p> <br/> Below is a list of how you can use case studies (with compliance or branch manager approval, of course): <br/> <strong>  On your website  <br/>  On your blog to tell your ideal clients and prospects  <br/>  With your centers of influence (share your sample documents or illustrations)  <br/>  With your strategic partners  <br/>  In your brochure, PowerPoint or other documents  <br/>  In your newsletter  <br/>  At events or workshops  <br/>  In all of your marketing material </strong> <br/> <br/> <strong>  How are you going to use case studies? </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 19:01:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 19:01:47.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_ywI5pdt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/build-your-ideal-client-profile-through-case-studies/\", \"post_id\": \"4948\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 19:01:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 19:01:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"build-your-ideal-client-profile-through-case-studies\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4947\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2223\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437603568260-1950d3ca6eab-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1303\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437735600,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

Of course, in order to do so, Mr. Clooney&rsquo;s aim is break down financial privacy.</p><p> There&rsquo;s been a long-standing war against financial privacy for years.</p><p> As western governments have slid further into bankruptcy, they&rsquo;ve made coordinated efforts to interdict privacy across the world through tax information exchange agreements, black lists, and turning bankers into unpaid spies.</p><p> Plus they&rsquo;ve been extremely clever in their marketing campaign, working tirelessly to associate financial privacy with some of the worst elements of society.</p><p> At first, their propaganda suggested that only people interested in financial privacy were guilty of tax evasion. Then organized crime. Then terrorist financing.</p><p> Now it&rsquo;s genocide.</p><p> This is really insane. Privacy is completely natural and part of our most basic social edicts.</p><p> Privacy is why it&rsquo;s taboo to discuss how much money you make. It&rsquo;s why we thrive on keeping secrets and knowing other people&rsquo;s secrets.</p><p> Privacy is normal. And for years it was something that used to be the rule, not the exception. Especially in regards to finance.</p><p> That was the origin of the term &ldquo;private banking&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t about money laundering. It was about being a grown adult and keeping your business to yourself.</p><p> Now they&rsquo;ve destroyed the concept to the point that anyone who seeks out financial privacy is suspect of tax evasion. Or organized crime. Or terror financing.

Or anybody else&rsquo;s except for his own.</p><p> Ominously, THE SENTRY has been among the first that I&rsquo;ve seen which specifically mentions gold as a means of illicit finance.</p><p> And governments have already taken dramatic steps to criminalize the holding of physical cash.</p><p> Apparently they want to ensure that your only financial option is to deposit your money with a shaky bank in a bankrupt country earning a rate of interest that fails to keep up with inflation.</p><p> Now, I think we can all agree that dictators are bad people (as are rapists, murderers, pedophiles, fraudsters, and corrupt politicians). And stopping them is a nice idea.</p><p> But the road to tyranny is always paved with the stones of good intentions.</p><p> Because no matter how many financial regulations get passed, and no matter how far the dictators are chased by Mr. Clooney on his white horse, the fact remains that bad people will always find the resources to do bad things.</p><p> And in the meantime, the crusade to save the world only serves to make everyone else less free.</p><p> This war on privacy is a war on freedom.

{"original_id":2182,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Your Skirt's Too Short! How to Avoid Dressing Provocatively for Work","link":"your-skirts-too-short-how-to-avoid-dressing-provocatively-for-work","source_link":null,"content":"Her top revealed a lot of cleavage. I didn&rsquo;t know where to look!Because of her seductive clothing, I couldn&rsquo;t hire her.Her skirt was so short that we referred to her as &ldquo;Suzy short skirt.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s that time of year again &ndash; time for the warm weather, when the number of women who dress seductively for work skyrockets, and I start hearing comments similar to those above in my seminars.Sexy is not a corporate look. Dressing provocatively in the workplace is the kind of mistake that can severely damage a woman&rsquo;s credibility. (Men can dress inappropriately, too, but that is a topic for another article.)The key for business women is to ask themselves these questions: What are you drawing attention to via your clothing? Are you promoting your professionalism, or your sexuality?Women can be feminine without flaunting their figures. Here are seven tips to avoid dressing provocatively:<strong> 1. Be cautious about modeling your clothing on the outfits worn by actresses on television. </strong>Even when they are portraying lawyers, doctors or other professionals, television characters often dress provocatively. But detectives in five-inch heels chasing after bad guys are not good role models!<strong> 2. Pay attention to the fit of your clothing. </strong>Your clothing needs to fit properly. You don&rsquo;t want to over-emphasize body parts! Skirts or slacks can bulge when the item is too tight across the buttocks. Buttons can pull on shirts if the item is too tight across the chest.<strong> 3. Don&rsquo;t reveal cleavage.</strong> Low-cut tops that expose cleavage draw attention to your chest, and are not suitable in the office. People tell me that they don&rsquo;t know where to look when conversing with women dressed that way. It&rsquo;s a distraction to others.<strong> 4. Don&rsquo;t show too much leg.</strong>Short skirts draw attention to your legs. If you sit down when wearing a short skirt, you expose even more leg. Is that where you want people to look? The general guideline is that skirts should be no higher than the top, or slightly above the top, of your knees.<strong> 5. Don&rsquo;t let your underwear show. </strong>Do I need to explain this one? This includes bra straps and thong underwear.<strong> 6. Take note of the size of the armholes when you wear a sleeveless dress. </strong> Make sure the armholes are snug enough that no one can see in.<strong> 7.

{"original_id":2181,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Developing Talent in Your Organization: Getting More From Your Employees by Giving M.O.R.E.","link":"developing-talent-in-your-organization-getting-more-from-your-employees-by-giving-m-o-r-e","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;We cannot create observers by saying &lsquo;observe&rsquo;, but by giving them the power and the means for this observation.&rdquo;  &mdash;Maria Montessori</p><h3> Get More</h3><p> <br/> While Maria Montessori was speaking about the education of children, her idea applies just as well to employees and how we develop the talent in our organizations. We want to hire the best and the brightest, we get really excited when we find them, and then they leave. Why? The only way to keep employees with great potential is to give them M.O.R.E.</p><p> Have you ever had the experience of pulling into your driveway after leaving the office and realizing that you drove the whole way home on auto pilot? Sometimes I have even found myself driving, going into auto pilot mode, and heading to the office when where I intended to go was Costco. This phenomenon makes me laugh at myself, but it also gets me thinking about engaging our minds in what we are doing when tasks become routine. What might we miss along the way? Will we end up at our intended destination?</p><p> So, what happens when our employees&rsquo; tasks become routine? If they are not challenged or engaged and their mind goes on auto pilot, what might they miss? What opportunities for improvement are we sacrificing? How long will employees with great potential stay with our organization if they aren&rsquo;t challenged and offered opportunity?</p><p> As a leader, you must learn to recognize the talent in your employees and give them the stage to shine. When you dedicate time and resources to developing the talent in your organization, you turn ordinary employees into extraordinary employees. If you want to get more from your employees, you are going to have to give M.O.R.E.</p><h3> Motivate</h3><p> <br/> Lee Iacocca emphasized that we should, &ldquo;Start with good people, lay out the rules, communicate with your employees, motivate them and reward them. If you do these things effectively, you can&rsquo;t miss.&rdquo; Your employees possess knowledge, skills, and experience that they want to share with your organization. When you encourage them to make the most of their talents and you invest in them, your employees will become motivated. You must recognize that each employee is unique; they possess different talents and are motivated in different ways. Show that you value their capabilities, help them further develop their talents, and motivate them based on their individual personalities.</p><h3> Opportunity</h3><p> <br/> Steven Spielberg believes, &ldquo;The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves.&rdquo; You must learn to see the extraordinary potential in each employee and give them the opportunity to reach it. Give them the necessary skills and resources they need and then let them tackle challenges on their own and in their own way. Provide a safe place for them to try, fail, and learn from their mistakes. Give employees the opportunity to become the best versions of themselves; let them learn from one another, design how their own work gets done, and make decisions on their own. Create opportunities for your employees and then help them see that opportunity is available all around them.</p><h3> Relationships</h3><p> <br/> Joyce Meyer tells us, &ldquo;We can improve our relationships with others by leaps and bounds if we become encouragers instead of critics.&rdquo; Build relationships with your employees based on mutual trust and respect. Invest your time and resources into bringing out the best in others; become their coach and loudest cheerleader. Build a strong sense of community where employees feel a sense of belonging and a vested interest in the success of the organization. Communicate openly and share information often so employees know where they stand as individuals, where the team stands, and where the organization stands. When employees know that you care and are looking out for their best interest, you will build strong relationships that foster trust and loyalty.</p><h3> Empower</h3><p> <br/> Tom Ridge explained, &ldquo;You have to enable and empower people to make decisions independent of you. As I&rsquo;ve learned, each person on a team is an extension of your leadership; if they feel empowered by you they will magnify your power to lead.&rdquo; Engage employees in contributing to problem identification and solving conversations. Encourage them to make decisions and to share their knowledge and experience with others. Give them the tools they need and then empower them to make decisions and take control of their own work.</p><h3> Give M.O.R.E.</h3><p> <br/> Everyone benefits when employees develop their talents; productivity increases, quality improves, and morale strengthens. When you invest in your employees and provide them with opportunity you will be amazed how your culture, morale, and outcomes improve.</p><p> Your investment in the development of your employees is proof that you value them as individuals, that you recognize the contribution they make to the organization, and that you are excited about their potential. As your employees grow, so will the capabilities and success of the organization, and so will you as a leader.</p><p> Help employees reach their full potential; retain valuable talent, and improve the adaptability of the organization by giving your employees M.O.R.E.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 18:36:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 18:36:24.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_IlSZXwp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/developing-talent-in-your-organization-getting-more-from-your-employees-by-giving-m-o-r-e/\", \"post_id\": \"4942\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 18:36:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 18:36:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"developing-talent-in-your-organization-getting-more-from-your-employees-by-giving-m-o-r-e\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4941\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2220\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/shutterstock_71958181-team-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"938\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437742800,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2180,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Kick-Ass Examples of Content Marketing","link":"7-kick-ass-examples-of-content-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Content marketing is all a buzz these days and headlines are even reading,  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/06/content-marketing-industry-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Content Marketing Now a Definitve Industry Term.  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  Personal brands and big businesses alike are loving all over content marketing, and for good reason. After all, it is proving its value hand over fist by doing exactly what it claims to do:</p><p> Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly-defined audience &mdash; and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.</p><p> Here is even some great data you can geek out over:  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/research/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   2015 Content Marketing Benchmark, Budgets &amp; Trends by Content Marketing Institute  </u>  . </a></p><p> I think most of us can now agree that there is really something to this whole content marketing movement. That is why I thought it would be fun to share some really excellent examples of content marketing. Admittedly, I&rsquo;m a glutton for some good marketing so here are my favorite pieces of content marketing and why:</p><h3> 1. &ldquo;Dear Kitten&rdquo; series presented by Buzzfeed &amp; Friskies <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4Sn91t1V4g\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"dear kitten\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dear-kitten.png\"/> </a></p><p> There is just something about cat videos that people go crazy about. Friskies and Buzzfeed capitalize on this obsession with their Dear Kitten series of videos that showcases the Friskies brand through a fun, shareable story that people actually want to watch. It raises awareness of the brand, amplifies their product reach and effectively builds their online audience of cat lovers and turns them into advocates.</p><h3> 2.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/WhatsUpMOMS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What&rsquo;s Up Moms  </a> </u> : Pretty much everything they post on YouTube <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKD2kzXSX-k\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"whatsupmoms\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/whatsupmoms-300x180.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s content that is either super useful or it&rsquo;s pleasantly entertaining. And at the end of every video they share is the opportunity to opt-in to their subscription list. They are creating compelling content with a very clear call to action to grow their subscribers. From recipes to parodies, these women are hysterical and really relate to their target audience. It&rsquo;s great content that people come back for again and again.</p><h3> 3.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL88A23B2B49A23137\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Subaru TV commercials  </a> </u></h3><p> &ldquo;They lived&rdquo;</p><p> <img alt=\"they lived\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/they-lived-300x197.png\"/></p><p> &ldquo;Subaru loyalty&rdquo;</p><p> <img alt=\"loyalty\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/loyalty-300x182.png\"/></p><p> We see these commercials on television and on their YouTube channel. What I love so much about Subaru&rsquo;s content is that it is selling what its audience values most. Subaru shows (rather than tells) how it understands what matters most to its customers and that they are designing cars based on that, first. The consistency and clarity of their message is spot on every time, regardless of the specific target audience they are talking to. They bring their customer&rsquo;s story to life in a truly compelling way that allows their target audience to recognize themselves in Subaru content. It&rsquo;s glorious.</p><h3> 4. Chris Brogan&rsquo;s emails, Owner Media Group LLC</h3><p> <br/> If you haven&rsquo;t yet subscribed to Owner Media,  <u>  <a href=\"http://owner.media/nl/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   then go here right now  </a> </u> . Chris Brogan is one of the fathers of content marketing. He is the shining example of how content marketing should work to drive actual results and sales.  All of his marketing outreach has a purpose, is personalized and delivers tons and tons of value. He&rsquo;s building subscribers honestly and then showers them with so much value that they really do want to make purchases for more. His approach is so simple and so effective. Seriously, just subscribe and you&rsquo;ll know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p><h3> 5. Jimmy Fallon&rsquo;s #Thursdays <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"jimmy fallon\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jimmy-fallon-1024x420.png\"/></p><p> Talk about a fun way to engage your audience! Jimmy Fallon has been doing #Thursdays for a long time now and does it ever get old? Content marketing can effectively accomplish many goals, such as user-based content created by your actual customers and &ldquo;fans&rdquo;! When your customers actually want to create content for your brand, your brand goes to a whole new level.</p><h3> 6. Southwest Airline&rsquo;s employee content <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SouthwestAir\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"southwest\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/southwest-300x300.png\"/> </a> <br/> I just really love how much Southwest loves its employees. Happy employees are fun to be around and Southwest really seems to embrace each employee for who they are. This is why on some flights the attendants crack jokes, rap safety procedures or sing. Every flight I&rsquo;ve ever been on is a little different thanks to the many personalities that shine through each trip. Southwest values its customers and delivers a truly remarkable experience through its happy employees.   <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SouthwestAir?clk=GFOOTER-TWITTER\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Just visit their Twitter page and you&rsquo;ll see customer uploaded videos and pictures of their remarkable experiences with the faces of Southwest: their awesome employees!  </a> </u></p><h3> 7. IBM <br/>  </h3><p> Say hello to the rise of the social employee thanks to IBM and their commitment to embracing social technologies! They are all about engaging customers through their content marketing and just brilliant at it! As any good content marketing should do, it should make the customer the hero of any brand&rsquo;s story and that is exactly what IBM is doing. They are telling their client&rsquo;s stories and how IBM helped them reach their goals. It&rsquo;s not about the big wins, it&rsquo;s about the client&rsquo;s wins, period. And who discovers these client stories? The employees. Hence, IBM is the model for how other brands can successfully cultivate a culture that celebrates employee engagement that builds client advocacy.</p><p> I have even more examples to share of really amazing content marketing &hellip; and not so amazing&hellip; I think I&rsquo;ll save the rest for next week.</p><p> Just as the best writers read a lot of great writing, the best content marketing takes in lot of great content. Pay attention to the ways these brands are killing it with their content marketing efforts. I think you&rsquo;ll notice the common denominator with all the examples I&rsquo;ve shared in this post is that audience is truly at the heart of their content marketing.</p><h3> Are you making your client the hero of your brand?</h3>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 18:19:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 18:19:24.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_dSZ4UZn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-kick-ass-examples-of-content-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"4940\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 18:19:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 18:19:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-kick-ass-examples-of-content-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4939\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2219\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437637555328-06b1692c8ec0-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"643\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437768000,"author_id":311,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2179,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Celebrity Marketing: Adding An Athlete Can Improve Your Brand's Bottom Line","link":"celebrity-marketing-adding-an-athlete-can-improve-your-brands-bottom-line","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobwillia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bob Williams  </u> </a> | <u>  The Brand Agent </u>  </p><p> Three interesting facts and tips about athletes and endorsements</p><h3> Choosing the right one</h3><p> <br/> Choosing an athlete for your brand is one of the more difficult parts of celebrity marketing.  Brands look for different  <u>  characteristics in athletes both on and off the field </u> .  On the field characteristics generally speak for themselves; anything to do with skill level, performance, potential ability, or style of play all help brands make a decision on which athlete they want to use for their campaign.  As a result many brands look to sign players with the potential to become the next superstar.  For example, Steph Curry signed a variety of deals with multiple brands as he started to emerge as an NBA talent. Then, in 2015, Curry won the MVP and the NBA Finals, making him infinitely more valuable to brands.  The brands who signed him prior to his breakout season benefited immensely from this.</p><p> Another important aspect to consider when signing athletes to deals is their off the field qualities.  Things like their personality or charisma, how well they interact with fans, their looks, and their background are all important.  A good example is David Beckham, who ticks off all the good measurables from that list. Combined with the fact that he is a world class player it is no wonder Beckham is such a sought after name in the advertising industry.</p><p> Finally, it is important to consider how the athlete is viewed by the targeted audience. Ensuring that the sport is popular in the campaign&rsquo;s region and making sure the demographic in question likes the team the athlete plays for are both important things to consider when choosing an athlete.</p><h3> Adds 4% to sales</h3><p> <br/> Athletes can bring plenty to the table in terms of success. A study by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.people.hbs.edu/aelberse/publications/elberse_verleun_2011.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business School  </a> </u>  concluded that athletes bring in up to 4% more in sales than other celebrities.  This number may sound relatively small but it translates to gains of over 10 million dollars annually.  In addition, this study also concluded that an athlete&rsquo;s performance over time goes hand in hand with sales.  For example, if a player wins a championship, the amount they bring in for the exact same promotion or ad rises.</p><h3> How much the athletes make</h3><p> <br/> A contributing factor in signing an athlete to a brand is the endorsement money.  This is one area that athletes are especially keen on.  This is because endorsements tend to make athletes much more money than their typical salary.  According to a study by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45eimdj/3-lebron-james/\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes  </a> </u> , LeBron James makes 53 million dollars from endorsements, compared to only 19 million from his salary and winnings.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 18:08:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 18:08:23.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_zcUjR86.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/celebrity-marketing-adding-an-athlete-can-improve-your-brands-bottom-line/\", \"post_id\": \"4938\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 18:08:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 18:08:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"celebrity-marketing-adding-an-athlete-can-improve-your-brands-bottom-line\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4937\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2218\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dfm_stephen_curry_shoot__3_-e1437514365875.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"365\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437764400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2178,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"2016 HR Trends to Watch","link":"2016-hr-trends-to-watch","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Yes, you read that right &hellip; It&rsquo;s mid-July 2015 and I&rsquo;m talking about trends for 2016.</p><p> Far too often organizations find themselves scrambling and playing catch-up to comply with changed or new regulations. We leave ourselves open to risk by not discussing, planning and implementing measures far enough in advance to be ready when its time to enforce and report. We hurt our reputations by not being ready to respond to requests from senior management and employees. We waste our time and resources scrambling to get advice from attorney, vendors and peers.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s do it differently for 2016! Let&rsquo;s start planning now for 2016. Let&rsquo;s be ahead of the game and ready to tackle the newest requirements for our organizations.</p><p> Here are 4 big things happening now that will probably have big impact on your organization  in 2016:</p><h3> Legalization of Same-Sex Marriage</h3><p> <br/> The SCOTUS decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States happened just a few weeks ago. Inevitably, this decision is going to lead to more same-sex marriages &hellip; And you know what that leads to??? Qualifying events!! Are you prepared for how you will handle qualifying events for health benefits for same-sex couples? Are you prepared for the additional related costs?</p><h3> Caitlyn Jenner</h3><p> <br/> The decision of former Olympian Bruce Jenner to change his gender, transition to a woman and live as Caitlyn Jenner has been front page news for months now. It has brought the subject of transgender identity front and center. This will lead to more transgender employees coming forward in our workplaces, requiring organizations to be prepared to make accommodations and address issues that may arise. Do you know the legal guidance and requirements from the EEOC or in your state on transgender accommodation? Are you prepared for how you will handle requests from transgender employees? Are you prepared to address discomfort or discrimination issues that may arise?</p><h3> The Affordable Care Act</h3><p> <br/> SCOTUS also ruled on the Affordable Care Act a few weeks ago, upholding the provision that allows individuals to obtain subsidized coverage from federal exchanges. This eliminated the chance of repeal of the law or another delay of full compliance. Employers will have to report on employee 2015 hours and eligibility to the government in 2016. Are you tracking employee hours and eligibility to get ready for this? Are you monitoring enrollment activity and obtaining waivers to defend against possible penalty assessment? Are you certain your plan and premiums meet the requirements of the law?</p><p> Another part of the ACA which employers need to be prepared for is the Excise Tax. Also called the &ldquo;Cadillac Tax&rdquo;, this will begin assessing up to a 40% tax charge on plans that exceed certain limits. With the law itself having stood several SCOTUS reviews and survived, those who don&rsquo;t like the ACA are setting their sites on this tax. It can be lessened or eliminated in Congress without involvement of the Court or the President. Hopefully, Congress will find middle ground on this before it goes into effect in 2018. In the meanwhile, employers need to have a plan for how they&rsquo;re going to address it if moves forward without change. Are you aware of and monitoring your limits to know what your potential tax liability could be?</p><h3> OT for Salary&rsquo;s under $50,400 per Year</h3><p> <br/> Earlier this month, the President added a wage and hour regulation into the Federal Register which would require employers to pay OT to salary employees earning $50,400 or less. Unless something drastic happens, this will become wage and hour law beginning in 2016, with all employers required to comply. Are you looking at your employee salaries and hours worked to determine your risk? Are you estimating the costs of this change to make decisions on how to staff and compensate your employees?</p><p> The legal landscape is always changing. And it impacts how we conduct business. We cannot be reactive to what is happening around us. We have to be prepared and ahead of the curve. These are just a few examples to look out for as 2015 continues to fly by and 2016 arrives before we know it. Look out for more examples. And share them when you find them to help others.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 17:47:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 17:47:57.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_8zRHY9r.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/2016-hr-trends-to-watch/\", \"post_id\": \"4936\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 17:47:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 17:47:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"2016-hr-trends-to-watch\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4935\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2217\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/caitlyn-jenner-2015-espys-justjared.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"565\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437746400,"author_id":427,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2176,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Secret to Achieve Any Goal in 2015 and Beyond","link":"the-secret-to-achieve-any-goal-in-2015-and-beyond","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Why do some people achieve great heights in life while others struggle?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not just luck; luck only takes you so far. It&rsquo;s not just hard work; many people work diligently their entire lives and never attain their goals. So what&rsquo;s the secret to success and happiness and achieving anything you want?</p><p> I can&rsquo;t answer what your definition of success and happiness should be. Only you can do that. I can, however, give you insight into a sobering way to keep yourself on track for accomplishing whatever it is you&rsquo;d like to achieve&mdash;for the rest of your life.</p><p> Lately, my beloved Chicago Bears have been in the news. After this so called season, they fired a number of the key executives and the ownership has been speaking to the press regarding how they will do whatever it takes to return to greatness. During these endless press conferences, they keep referring to a quote that hangs in Halas Hall (home of the Bears Corporate offices) that was uttered by George Halas. George Halas was not only the Chicago Bears&rsquo; founder, but also one of the patriarchs of professional football. The quote reads, &ldquo;Nobody who ever gave their best regretted it.&rdquo;</p><p> I absolutely love the Bears (although not their 2014 version) and have tremendous respect for Papa Bear, but I don&rsquo;t love that quote. Here&rsquo;s why. People who don&rsquo;t achieve their goals usually do so because of two very related reasons&mdash;even though they might think they did their best.</p><p> The first is the goal was set for something they didn&rsquo;t truly love. The second is they didn&rsquo;t do everything that was necessary to achieve the goal. When they fail, the first question they typically ask themselves is, &ldquo; Did I give it my best?&rdquo; If so, no regret. Check. Everything is fine. Check. Let&rsquo;s move on with life. Check. Now they&rsquo;re on their way to another goal they&rsquo;re unlikely to achieve.</p><h3> Why?</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ll get to that in a moment. Let&rsquo;s assume for the sake of argument that you actually set the goal for something you would give your next born to accomplish. It&rsquo;s your true love. Can&rsquo;t go an entire day without thinking about this goal.</p><p> If you truly love something and didn&rsquo;t achieve that significant goal related to it, I suggest a different approach. Instead of asking whether you gave it your &ldquo;best,&rdquo; ask yourself &ldquo;What was I unwilling to do to achieve the goal?&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll have your answer.</p><p> I would argue that you could accomplish whatever it is you set out to achieve (nay my desire to be an NBA Center with my 5&rsquo;6&rdquo; frame&mdash;but you get the picture). You simply need to make sure that you understand first what it is you need to sacrifice before starting! And, then, of course, be willing to give it up!</p><p> Most people that are goal-oriented identify the goal, set it, plan for it, revise it if necessary, and then execute toward achieving it. The step they often forget at the beginning is identifying&mdash;in detail&mdash;the sacrifices they&rsquo;ll need to make to ensure they can execute it fully. These sacrifices (smile if you&rsquo;re with me) look something like time, money, sleep, family outings, and so on.</p><p> Didn&rsquo;t save enough money? Couldn&rsquo;t live without the $5.68/day latte? Just had to have that new sweater?</p><p> Couldn&rsquo;t finish that book you wanted to write? Couldn&rsquo;t wake up an hour earlier every day for an entire year? Didn&rsquo;t look hard enough for a publisher?</p><p> Didn&rsquo;t qualify as a first chair violinist concertmaster? You weren&rsquo;t willing to keep practicing until you couldn&rsquo;t make a mistake?</p><h3> You get the idea.</h3><p> <br/> Please don&rsquo;t misconstrue my message. It makes no difference to me whether you&rsquo;re unwilling to sacrifice time, sleep, and so on. It&rsquo;s your life and you are the master of your happiness. My point is that when you reflect on goals you were either unable to achieve or about to embark on, make sure to ask yourself &ldquo;What will I need to give up to accomplish this goal?&rdquo;</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 15:47:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 15:47:24.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_ZB0p9Vf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-secret-to-achieve-any-goal-in-2015-and-beyond/\", \"post_id\": \"4932\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 15:47:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 15:47:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-secret-to-achieve-any-goal-in-2015-and-beyond\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4931\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2215\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/The-secret-to-achieving-any-goal-in-2015-and-beyond.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"292\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437739200,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}

This is one who strives to accept each person and wants the best for all. This is the body that allows individuals to open up and care about one another. In the body of the lover we see the following:</p><h3> Overall view of the world: </h3><p> <br/> This body allows for harmony. In fact, this body attempts to regulate harmony by facilitating everyone getting along. This is also the body that is the glue of the organization, putting the team and the needs of the organization first. This is the body of the cheerleader, the caregiver, the team player, and the good listener. This body allows the best in all to come to the forefront; however, at times this body also slows the team down in its desire for all to get along. It can also be the body of &ldquo;sad puppy,&rdquo; possibly taking offense to something someone said or did, instead of just letting it go and moving on.</p><h3> Moods and Emotions:</h3><p> <br/> Moods and emotions in this body are generally always present, although they are subdued and subtle so that they do not make others uncomfortable. If there is a positive event, then they are readily available to share. If however there is a negative, confrontational type event they are hidden from sight to insure that the individuals involved are safe from harm. This body allows for moods such as compassion, caring, tenderness and concern for others to always be in great supply when needed by others. When others show emotions such as hurt, sadness, vulnerability, this body allows the positive antidote emotions to create harmony in order for teamwork to shine through.</p><h3> How it shows up in the body:  </h3><p> <br/> In the body of the lover the overall shape of the body is open and inviting. There is less muscle tension and the body allows for others to have their space. The feet are parallel to one another, slightly apart with the knees soft. The hands and arms are away from the sides with the palms open and facing up and forward, as if inviting others in for a hug. The face is relaxed and quick with a smile or at least a hint of welcoming. The energy of this body is very receiving and more down than up, inviting others to feel safe with it.</p><h3> The Mantra of this body: </h3><p> <br/> The mantra that arises in this body is &ldquo; We are in this together,&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is good in all team members.&rdquo;</p><p> Where this body might serve you or hinder you: The advantage to this body is the ability to accept others with differing views from it&rsquo;s own. It allows harmony and consensus. It allows a team to be built by bringing out the strengths of every individual. The challenge in this body is that because its focus on everyone getting along, it can hinder success in certain scenarios and slow down processes. This body can frustrate others because of its inability to make an arbitrary stand or a commitment.</p><p> To show up as the lover at work means that you are inviting harmony and teamwork, with the challenge being that sometimes not everyone can get along.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-23 15:10:29.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-23 15:10:29.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Wc2uJRS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-a-lover-at-work/\", \"post_id\": \"4927\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-23 15:10:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-23 15:10:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-a-lover-at-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4926\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2213\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Lover-at-Work-800x390.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"947\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437765300,"author_id":120,"chart_url":""}

When you&rsquo;ve been working with a client for many years, the tendency is to take each other for granted. If you&rsquo;re like the vast majority of professionals, most of your marketing and promotional resources go to new, prospective clients rather than to your existing clients. As benign neglect sets in, your long-term client may become intrigued by other professionals in your field&mdash;competitors whose ideas seem newer and fresher, who are courting him aggressively. Just as in a marriage, the antidote to wandering clients is constant reinvestment that revitalizes the relationship.</p><p> When I look at professionals who have long-term, broad-based client relationships, who inspire great client loyalty, they all have a similar approach: they treat each assignment as if it were the first one for that client. They bring the same energy, creativity, and drive to their long-term clients as they do to the new client whom they are trying to impress. They communicate constantly, and the flow of ideas never stops. Even if they aren&rsquo;t working on an assignment for the client at that moment, they are in touch at least two or three times a year. The courtship, so to speak, never stops.</p><h3> How do you reinvigorate an old relationship? Try these strategies:</h3><li> If you work with a firm, bring new colleagues into the account. Consider changing the relationship manager&mdash;who may be you!</li><li> Hold a client relationship review. Sit down with your client and gain a fresh view of their challenges and opportunities. You&rsquo;ll be surprised how much you might learn.</li><li> Ask yourself, &ldquo;What would a competitor do to try and make inroads with my client?&rdquo; Then, consider doing it yourself.</li><li> Challenge yourself to come up with three new ideas, each quarter, for improving the client&rsquo;s business. Share these with your client on a regular basis.</li><li> Build relationships with new executives within the client&rsquo;s organization.

{"original_id":2172,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are Financial Advisers Supposed to Get Paid?","link":"are-financial-advisers-supposed-to-get-paid","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=willortel&amp;original_referer=http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/07/20/are-financial-advisers-supposed-to-get-paid/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Will Ortel  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cfainstitute\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   CFA Institute  </u> </a>  </p><p> For many investment professionals, the seemingly inexorable rise of robo-advisers constitutes an existential threat. The fear is simple and justified: Services now exist that provide investors with a portfolio that fits their expressed risk tolerance and reward inclinations for 0.25% of the assets invested in that portfolio.</p><p> That&rsquo;s comparably a great deal and thus financial advisers offering a similar service are in a tough place.</p><p> If we use the example of a financial adviser currently making $75,000 a year, one who splits their fee down the middle with their firm, we can see this pretty clearly. At a 1% fee, this adviser can make a comfortable middle-class income if they spend 60 hours a week talking to 100 or so happy clients with a grand total of $15 million invested with the firm.</p><p> If their fee were lowered to 0.25% of assets, the adviser would need to either take on more clients (and provide less service to existing ones) or seek wealthier clients. Either way, their firm would need $60 million in assets instead of $15 million to make the same amount of money. Like, duh, right?</p><p> If losing that much in fees worries you, a widely shared blog post should terrify you.  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@blakeross/wealthfront-silicon-valley-tech-at-wall-street-prices-fdd2e5f54905\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blake Ross  </u>  ,  <u>   who co-founded Firefox before spending six years at Facebook as director of product, maintains that those already-reduced fees are astronomically high and should be closer to zero  </u> </a> . He even accuses Wealthfront, one of the larger robo-advisers, of embodying the same &ldquo;Wall Street&rdquo; mentality that many find reprehensible.</p><p> So while investment professionals are staring at robo-advisers and wondering how they&rsquo;ll ever compete on cost, technology folks are looking at robo-advisers and wondering if they can be undercut further. I&rsquo;ve been saying this for a long time at this point, but  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/12/01/free-investing-is-the-new-free-checking-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   free investing is the new free checking  </a> </u> . The cost of these services is going to approach and eventually reach zero.</p><h3> So What Should You Do?</h3><p> <br/> Enterprising Investor  is written for professional investors, so it&rsquo;s tempting to interpret the question above from a business perspective. What should you do if you want to stay competitive?</p><p> The thing is that good business comes from good outcomes, so let&rsquo;s ask the question from a different vantage point. What should you do if you want to give your clients a good outcome?</p><p> Blake&rsquo;s argument is really simple to encapsulate. Many robo-advisers compare their fees to the typical investment adviser&rsquo;s 1% and argue that they are fantastic. But that&rsquo;s not necessarily the right benchmark to use. All fees reduce investment return, so what would happen if you didn&rsquo;t pay any of them?</p><p> Well, if you&rsquo;re able to save $5,000 a year for 50 years and invest it at a constant 6%, you&rsquo;d be richer.</p><p> The more than $300,000 gap between a 1% annual fee and a .25% annual fee is striking, but so is the $125,000 gap between paying a seemingly nominal .25% and nothing. If you paid 1% a year in fees, you&rsquo;d have an account that is smaller by 28.5%, whereas if you paid just .25%, you&rsquo;d be behind by just over 8%.</p><p> <strong>  Value after 50 Years of Saving $5,000 Annually </strong> <br/> <img alt=\"Value after 50 Years of Saving $5,000 Annually\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/07/Value-after-50-Years-of-Saving-5000.png?resize=584%2C415\"/> <br/> And remember, that&rsquo;s for an account that receives regular contributions over time. For a lump sum investment, the gap is even larger.</p><p> So like, why would you pay fees? The answer you have to give is because the fees are for services that add value, right? So the only question that matters is simple . . .</p><h3> Value Compared to What?</h3><p> <br/> Blake&rsquo;s post makes the point that many of the services that Wealthfront and other similar robo-advisers provide are of uncertain or questionable value, and he may well be right. It&rsquo;s awfully difficult to beat a Vanguard target date retirement fund on cost.</p><p> But what is value here? What&rsquo;s the point of saving money? Managing someone&rsquo;s money well should be about maximizing their quality of life. It seems quite reductive to distill that down to the size of their bank account in retirement. Everybody  <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EmZRLxnXamM?t=4s\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wants more money  </a> </u> , but it&rsquo;s not the point of existence. It&rsquo;s just a means to buy the stuff you need or want.</p><p> A mean-variance optimized portfolio, however it&rsquo;s delivered, is simply not the same as insight into what you will need and might want. It is also not as valuable. If you approach a client with a perfectly customized portfolio but fail to explain the role it will play in their life, they won&rsquo;t care very much. They might well become a client, but they will miss the point of the exercise and you will have failed both them and yourself.</p><p> So don&rsquo;t neglect the conversations that are really important when you sit down with your clients. Don&rsquo;t forget to ask them about what they&rsquo;re doing to live a good life. You should be able to have discussions about the trade-off between spending money now to  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/10/15/can-financial-advisers-make-their-clients-happy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   be happier  </a> </u>  and saving it for later in a context that is broader than an ending account balance.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re willing and able to have those sorts of conversations with clients, then it&rsquo;ll be worth paying top dollar for your services. But that assertion only confirms that the product you provide &mdash; advice &mdash; is worth something. It doesn&rsquo;t tackle the question of how to charge for it.</p><p> That&rsquo;s somewhat intentional. How do you think we should be charging?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-22 19:54:25.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-22 19:54:25.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_BTXE4k5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-financial-advisers-supposed-to-get-paid/\", \"post_id\": \"4923\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-22 19:54:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-22 19:54:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-financial-advisers-supposed-to-get-paid\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4922\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2211\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437389681636-61be13cc221d-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"538\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437652800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2169,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Easy Tips to Save More Money in the Military","link":"three-easy-tips-to-save-more-money-in-the-military","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whether you are brand new to savings and investing, or whether you have been saving for a while, there are always a few things you can consider adjusting in order to give yourself more flexibility in your monthly budget. After all, every extra dollar you can save and invest today will have a huge impact on your finances after 20 to 30 years of compounding growth. I&rsquo;ll go into the power of compounding interest in another post, but I think it&rsquo;s most important to realize that EVERYONE can and should be on a savings plan, no matter how small.</p><h3> Everyone Can Find a Way to Save Just a Little More of Their Hard Earned Income</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s just a matter of getting yourself started &ndash; and there should really be no excuses. I&rsquo;ve met retired LTCs with a full pension and a nice six digit post-military income with ZERO dollars to his family&rsquo;s net worth; they simply spent it all somehow. Now, contrast that with a young E-6, who had begun saving as soon as he entered the military and already has a net worth of around $200K.</p><p> How is this possible? We all know the income discrepancies between officers and enlisted. These are true stories, and there are many more I&rsquo;m sure that you could share with me as well. Now, I realize that they are the extreme, but let&rsquo;s look at a few ways either a new investor can get started or an existing investor can improve.</p><h3> 1. Have Someone Take a Good Hard Look at Your Tax Returns</h3><p> <br/> I realize everyone likes to get that nice big fat refund each year at tax time. Most people already have big plans on how they&rsquo;re going to use it. Pay off credit card debt, go on a vacation, or maybe just buy something nice they&rsquo;ve been waiting for. But in reality you&rsquo;re just giving the government an interest free loan for more than a year.</p><p> That money should be working for you during that time! Reset your mindset about the refund and choose to not want any money back. If you want that big ticket item you should plan to save for it well in advance. But your tax refund should be invested in your accounts, earning you interest in the meantime.</p><p> So, each year make sure you speak with someone who knows how to look at a tax return and your LES (or pay stub) and can make sure your deductions are correct. Depending on your life situation, a small adjustment could put hundreds of dollars back into your monthly budget.</p><h3> 2. Open a High Yield Savings Account Away From Your Normal Bank</h3><p> <br/> The idea is to use the &ldquo;pay yourself first&rdquo; mentality. With a good financial plan, you&rsquo;ll know the number you need to put away each month in order for you to hit your long term goals. The question is, can you commit to that number and adjust your current lifestyle accordingly?</p><p> So why use a third party bank? Well, there are a few reasons that might be a good choice to improve your savings habits. First, out of sight and out of mind. Each month that money comes right out of your checking and goes to an account you can&rsquo;t easily touch.  Second, you&rsquo;ll be building that coveted emergency fund in a place that gets at least a better yield than sitting in your checking account.  Third, its a great place to use as a conduit to begin funding your other investments once you get those programs started.</p><h3> 3.  Stop Acting Like Your TDY Money is Fodder for Vegas!</h3><p> <br/> I think most people are well aware that the majority of per-diem allowances are much larger than they need to be in most cases.  Everyone is happy when they come home from a trip and file that travel voucher and rake in all the meal money because they didn&rsquo;t eat out on the trip.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, eating out is expensive and if you can save money in that department you&rsquo;ll have major impacts on your budget.  However, rarely do I see someone turn around and treat that money as a little bonus and put it back into their budget.  In fact, that money should go directly into the high yield account I mentioned above.  If you are doing that, then huge high fives all around.  Know that you stand above the crowd.</p><h3> There Are Plenty of Hidden Places to Find an Extra Few Bucks to Save and it Adds Up Fast!</h3><p> <br/> I hope this give you just a hint of the many little things you can look at or adjust in a monthly budget to improve your cashflow.  Even an extra $50 that was being wasted can add up to over $8,000 in ten years even if it only gets a 6% growth rate. Constantly reviewing your monthly budget with a professional is one of the best ways to ensure you are making all the efficient moves to be on a path for financial success.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-22 19:39:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-22 19:39:27.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_7vn7U8w.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-easy-tips-to-save-more-money-in-the-military/\", \"post_id\": \"4917\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-22 19:39:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-22 19:39:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-easy-tips-to-save-more-money-in-the-military\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4916\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2208\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/us_armed_forces2.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"518\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437678000,"author_id":434,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2168,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"No More Whispering: It's Time to Talk About Cancer","link":"no-more-whispering-its-time-to-talk-about-cancer","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In 1974,  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Ford\" target=\"_blank\">   Betty Ford  </a> </u>  changed the future of cancer. Perhaps known best for making her struggles with alcoholism public a few years later, this forward-thinking woman, who spoke openly about her mastectomy for breast cancer at a time when the disease was still a whispered topic even within families, was groundbreaking. It brought the reality of breast cancer into the public eye and into the forefront of many people&rsquo;s minds for the first time in history. This changed how cancer was treated socially, politically, and medically. By speaking out, Betty Ford empowered women to speak openly about the disease and make their own choices about their treatments and their bodies. She brought a global awareness to the disease that exploded the discussions in the medical community, opened up floodgates of research funding, and expanded treatment options.</p><p> &ldquo;The Big C&rdquo; is weighing heavily on my mind right now. On Mother&rsquo;s Day, my daughter-in-law was diagnosed with colon cancer and is now undergoing treatment. And in February my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer which led to two lumpectomies and, on Monday, a mastectomy. Having dealt with it myself when I had my own battle with breast cancer two decades ago, I can see how times have changed&mdash;not in the treatment of cancer necessarily (it seems amazingly medieval to me that we&rsquo;re still removing body parts and poisoning our bodies to try to eradicate this disease), but in its sheer prevalence. Cancer&mdash;breast and other forms&mdash;has reached epidemic levels. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@editorial/documents/document/acspc-044552.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   American Cancer Society  </a> </u>  has estimated 1,658,370 new cases of cancer in the US in 2015 alone. Just under a quarter million of those cases are attributed to breast cancer. Most of us have either experienced cancer first hand, within our family, or among our closest circle of friends. A decade ago, I felt people at work looked at me differently because of my cancer. I felt tainted. And whether or not that was accurate or I was projecting how I felt myself, a woman dealing with breast cancer today is more likely to get the reaction of, &ldquo;Oh, you too?&rdquo;</p><p> In his Pulitzer Prize Winning book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography/dp/1439170916\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Emperor of All Maladies  </a> </u> , Siddhartha Mukherjee calls cancer &ldquo;the defining plague of our generation.&rdquo; Of course, no matter how common it has become, the impact of a cancer diagnosis can feel devastating, both to the patient and those who love them. My client Cindy is dealing with a terrible diagnosis, and it&rsquo;s unlikely she will live another 12 months, but she can&rsquo;t get herself to bring up early retirement to her husband. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t face it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Whenever I talk about leaving work, he seems to panic with the reality of the future. I just can&rsquo;t do it to him.&rdquo; Another client, Louis, came to me after his cancer went into remission. Two years ago, soon after his surgery, he and his wife splurged on a $60,000 luxury vacation with their whole family. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t afford it. I know that now,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But at the time, all that mattered was enjoying every moment.&rdquo;</p><p> When I&rsquo;m helping my clients through these issues, I&rsquo;m struck by the financial impact cancer has on the lives of the patient and those around them. We all owe Betty Ford a huge thank you for changing how cancer is viewed, talked about, and accepted. But knowing that the lifetime risk of developing cancer is now slightly less than 1 in 2 for men and a little more than 1 in 3 for women*, there&rsquo;s one more big change that needs to take place: how we view and manage cancer from a financial planning perspective. And it needs to start today.</p><p> Solid financial planning before a cancer diagnosis is critical because once you&rsquo;ve been diagnosed, it may be impossible to obtain the insurance you need to help you through treatment or, in the worst case, help your family in case of your death. When cancer strikes, money is the last thing anyone wants to think about, but Cindy and Louis are great examples of how our emotions can derail our financial decision-making&mdash;even when it&rsquo;s more important than ever to make wise choices about your money. Here are a few questions to get you started today:</p><p> <strong>  Do you have sufficient life insurance coverage? </strong></p><p> Once a cancer (or other diagnosis) comes your way, it may not be possible to get a policy.</p><p> <strong>  Is the family caregiver in your family insured? </strong></p><p> In families where only one parent works outside the home, many neglect to get a life insurance for the at-home caregiver.</p><p> <strong>  Are you taking the maximum available disability insurance (DI) at work? </strong></p><p> The majority of workers sign up for only the basic, employer-provided coverage. The cost for additional coverage is often minimal, and well worth the added security.</p><p> <strong>  If you don&rsquo;t receive disability insurance through your employer, do you have private disability insurance? </strong></p><p> Insurance is vital to provide living wages in case of a disability.</p><p> <strong>  Do you have long-term care (LTC) insurance? Don&rsquo;t assume LTC insurance is only for the elderly. </strong></p><p> Getting a policy in your 40s or 50s is affordable, and protects you at the time in life when many cancers are found.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Albom\" target=\"_blank\">   Mitch Albom  </a> </u> , the bestselling author of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tuesdays-Morrie-Young-Greatest-Lesson/dp/076790592X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tuesdays with Morrie  </a> </u> , wrote, &ldquo;Mortality means you don't have forever to work things out. You can live your life unexamined but then on the last day you're going to think: 'I've left things a little late.'&rdquo; I urge you: don&rsquo;t leave things a little late. Take care of the things today that can have a major impact on your own finances should you become ill (with cancer or anything else that knocks you to your knees) down the road.

{"original_id":2165,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Six Rules for Smart Simplicity and Employee Engagement","link":"six-rules-for-smart-simplicity-and-employee-engagement","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Is this the secret to employee engagement? <br/> <br/> I recently came across a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/yves_morieux_as_work_gets_more_complex_6_rules_to_simplify.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TED Talk by Yves Morieux  </a> </u>  of Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and wondered if within it lies not only the answer to employee disengagement but perhaps the solution to helping companies do their part in the engagement equation. In his talk, he poses a question, a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, something along the lines of:  Does being less engaged make employees less productive... or vice versa, are they disengaged because they have so much more pressure to produce more? It's an interesting talk, where he dives into how complex businesses have become - including an extreme focus on KPIs that, in the end, have little bearing on the business - and how employees have to compensate with their own individual efforts for the complexities and the lack of cooperation within an organization. <br/> <br/> I did some research to find out more, to find out if this theory of the complexity of organizations is really a thing. And according to BCG, it is. They created an  index of complicatedness , for which they surveyed over 100 listed companies in the U.S. and Europe. They found that, over the last 15 years, the number of procedures, vertical layers, interface structures, coordination bodies, and decision approvals needed increased for these companies 50-350%, with an average increase of 6.7% over the last 50 years. Wow! We've really made things harder for ourselves. Seems like when people say, \"Work/life was so much easier 50 years ago,\" perhaps they're on to something. <br/> <br/> They found that, in the most-complicated companies, managers spend 40% of their time writing reports and 30-60% of time in meetings, leaving very little time for actual people management. And we can only extrapolate what that leads to: misguided efforts and lack of career development, to name a few things. Employees in these complicated organizations are three times more likely to be disengaged - and work satisfaction and productivity are much lower - than those in the other companies! <br/> <br/> Something's got to give. We need a solution... <br/> <br/> Yves and his colleagues at BCG created this concept of \"smart simplicity\" to help overcome the complexities of organizations and the resultant employee experience/disengagement. Smart simplicity is all about creating an environment where:  employees can work with one another to develop creative solutions to complex challenges. This supposedly reduces structural and procedural complicatedness and allows companies to become smarter and more streamlined - with employee engagement also being an outcome. <br/> <br/> Smart simplicity has six rules. <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Know what your colleagues do.  </strong> Seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it? But I've been there. I've worked with and for people who have no idea what I do (or what the company really does, sadly). <br/> <br/> BCG states:  To respond to complexity intelligently, people have to really understand each other&rsquo;s work: the goals and challenges others have to meet, the resources they can draw on, and the constraints under which they operate. People can&rsquo;t find this kind of information in formal job descriptions; they can learn it only by observing and interacting. <br/> <br/> The manager&rsquo;s job is to make sure that such learning takes place. Without this shared understanding, people will blame problems on other people&rsquo;s lack of intelligence or skills, not on the resources and constraints of the organization. <br/> <br/> Absent clear guidance and directives, people act in a way that protects their own interests. Leaders must understand that and adapt the culture to make sure all interests are in alignment with what the company is trying to achieve. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Reinforce the integrators. </strong>  Based on how Yves describes integrators, I assume we can equate them to cross-functional leaders and teams. <br/> <br/> BCG states:  Conflicts between front and back offices are often inherent. Back offices typically need to standardize processes and work, and front offices have to accommodate the needs of individual customers. <br/> <br/> A common organizational response is to create some sort of coordinating unit&mdash;a middle office. But that just turns one problem into two: between the back and middle offices, and between the middle and front offices. The same thing happens vertically in organizations: Coordination problems between the corporate center and country operations trigger the creation of regional layers in between. Another common solution is to impose a coordinating procedure like computerized job requests. <br/> <br/> A better response is to empower line individuals&mdash;or groups&mdash;to play that integrative role. In almost any unit you will find one or two managers&mdash;often from a particular function&mdash;who already interact with multiple stakeholders (customers as well as other functions). If you&rsquo;ve followed the first rule and observed people at work, it will probably be fairly obvious to you who these individuals or groups are. These people can act as integrators, helping teams obtain from others the cooperation needed to deliver more value. <br/> <br/> Yves suggests reinforcing their power by increasing their responsibilities, giving them more authority, and removing rules. He believes the bigger the company, the bigger the need for for integrators, which equates to needing fewer rules. This is clearly counter-intuitive, and most people really believe the opposite to be true. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Increase the total quantity of power. </strong>  Do so by empowering everyone to use their best judgment. <br/> <br/> BCG states:  Usually, the people with the least power in an organization shoulder most of the burden of cooperation and get the least credit. When they realize this, they often withdraw from cooperation and hide in their silos. Companies that want to prevent this and increase cooperation need to give these people more power so that they can take the risk of moving out of isolation, trusting others, showing initiative, and being transparent about performance. <br/> <br/> However, firms have to do this without taking power away from others in the system. The answer is to create new power bases, by giving individuals new responsibilities for issues that matter to others and to the firm&rsquo;s performance. <br/> <br/> I would equate this to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/06/employee-ownership.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   employee ownership  </a> </u> . From the employee perspective, they think and act like they own the business. It's about being passionate about what they do, not standing at the sidelines waiting to be spoon-fed; it's about taking the horse by the reins and running with the directive (the brand promise), being accountable for their roles in the execution of the customer experience and in the success of the business, working together with others who are just as passionate and who share a common goal, and feeling like they are a part of something bigger, something they want to see grow, flourish, and succeed. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Extend the shadow of the future. </strong>  Help employees understand the impact of their work and their decisions by designing feedback loops that expose them to the consequences of their actions in a more timely manner. <br/> <br/> BCG states:  The longer it takes for the consequences of a decision to take effect, the more difficult it is to hold a decision maker accountable. Many who are involved at the launch of a three-year project will no longer be around when it&rsquo;s completed&mdash;they will have been moved to another job or location, or promoted. They won&rsquo;t be affected by the consequences of the actions they take, the trade-offs they make, or how well they cooperate. People are more likely to feel the shadow of the future if you bring the future closer. <br/> <br/> One of the basic tenets, I believe, of employee engagement is to make sure employees understand both that their contributions are valued as well as how they matter, i.e., what impact they have on the business. Especially when it comes to CX strategies and process improvements (that yield a better customer experience), these projects often take an extended period of time to design, develop, and execute. Regularly reinforcing how their work matters to the big picture will have positive effects on engaging employees. <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Increase reciprocity. </strong>  Remove the buffers that make us self-sufficient, and then cooperation ensues. It forces people to work together. And yes, this is a good thing. I think this ties in well with Rule #1, since, absent clear directives, we do what we need to do to protect our own interests, hence feel we are self-sufficient. If we know what our colleagues do, there's a better chance to increase reciprocity (teamwork). <br/> <br/> BCG states:  A good way to spur productive cooperation is to expand the responsibilities of integrators beyond activities over which they have direct control. Making their goals richer and more complex will drive them to resolve trade-offs rather than avoid them. But if you measure people only on what they can control, they will shy away from helping with many other problems you need their input on.  <br/> <br/> As you spread responsibility for achieving outcomes, don&rsquo;t feel you have to give people more resources to go with it. It&rsquo;s actually often better to take resources away.   <br/> <br/> It's an interesting concept. Once you take those resources away, people are more likely to rely on each other, collaborate, and work together.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Reward those who cooperate. </strong>  This is an interesting one. In talking about employee engagement, we always say that rewards and recognition are important to the employee. But according to Yves, it's more about blaming those who don't cooperate. He cites a quote from Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, the CEO of the Lego Group:  Blame is not for failure but for failing to help or ask for help. <br/> <br/> I never actually thought of it that way, but it certainly makes sense.  <br/> <br/> Yves states: If people are afraid to fail, they will hide problems from you and your peers. Reward people who surface problems - and punish those who don&rsquo;t come together to help solve them. <br/> <br/> These rules really present an interesting approach to employee engagement. Employees are empowered, work together, know how their contributions matter, and are allowed to take risks and fail - all in an environment where complexities, in general, have been removed.

They told me it was life changing and consciousness raising yet all I saw was their almost cultish devotion and the significant ongoing expense.(If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the Forum, you may know its predecessor,  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training\" target=\"_blank\">   EST  </a> </u> .) Finally, I said yes just to get them to stop asking. Needless to say, after my session, I didn&rsquo;t enroll. However, it was my first taste of personal development training, watching how much people crave it and wondering about the long-term impact.</p><p> Personal development is still hot. Twenty-five years after I attended my evening at the Forum, I now have a greater understanding of the drive to improve your life and personal leadership &ndash; I&rsquo;m firmly in that group. However,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/self-help-overload/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   our options for personal development are have exploded  </a> </u>  and, unfortunately, very little results in lasting change.</p><h3> What do you do to foster your personal development and long-term growth? <br/>  </h3><li> Read books</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/1-on-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hire a coach  </a> </u></li><li> Attend a seminar</li><li> Listen to podcasts</li><li> Join hangouts</li><li> Subscribe to blogs (like Break the Frame!)</li><li> Take a MOOC (I loved this one on  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/positive-psychology\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Positive Psychology MOOC  </a> </u> ) <br/>  </li><p> And when do you sleep? See friends, family? Exercise? Go to work? We all have 24 hours in a day and it can be  <u>  difficult to find the time for everything </u>  you want to do for yourself and your life. For many, personal development is the first to go yet it comes down to choice.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22No+time%22+is+an+excuse.+Personal+development+is+an+investment+in+you.+%23YouMatter&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/personal-development-myths/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   &ldquo;No time&rdquo; is an excuse. Personal development is an investment in you. #YouMatter  </u> </a></p><h3> 5 Myths of Personal Development (plus a free bonus myth): <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Personal Development MYTH #1: There&rsquo;s a finish line. </strong></p><p> What? This personal development thing is forever? Like a lifetime? Yup. Not a great way to kick off the myth list, huh? However, personal development is not about attending a course or reading a book or reaching a final destination with a cool label like &ldquo;happy&rdquo; or &ldquo;actualized&rdquo; or &ldquo;whole.&rdquo; Truthfully, it&rsquo;s about  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/5-steps-to-break-the-rules-and-change-your-results/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the change in you  </a> </u>  &ndash; the outcome of your investment. With every shift, there&rsquo;s another place within you to explore, grow and understand that was unavailable to you yesterday.</p><p> <strong>  Personal Development MYTH #2: Feeling inspired = long-term change. </strong></p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, books that inspire you to change are keepers. However,  <strong>  temporary motivation and inspiration aren&rsquo;t the same things as making a sustainable shift. </strong>  When I read the  <a href=\"https://arbinger.com/anatomyofpeace/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Anatomy of Peace  </u>    </a> for the first time, it led to more reading, yes, but also to nearly a year of study with the Arbinger Institute. Still, despite all the study and reading, without the daily immersion and inspiration, it began to fade. My choice was to shrug and move on or dig in again to put it back into daily practice. (I chose to double down on the work)</p><p> <strong>  Personal Development MYTH #3: It&rsquo;s a competition for self-actualization. </strong></p><p> People who are into personal development often have friends who are on the same wavelength; Sharing inspiring quotes, images, constantly attending yoga retreats&hellip;  <strong>  Here&rsquo;s the deal, your aha! may not come from the same place as your friend. </strong> Leave bandwagons, well, for the band, and focus on places that resonate with you instead of following the latest craze or guru. There is no race to the finish line to be the most, um, developed. Go at your pace and let go of the pressure.</p><p> <strong>  Personal Development MYTH #4: Habits, once formed, stick around forever. </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;m embarrassed to write that I want to start exercising more regularly &ndash; again. I did it six days a week for months, months! I thought it was a stick around kind of habit, but the piece I was missing was that it was always a daily choice. Will I or won&rsquo;t I? I stopped short of automatic. <strong>   It boils down to this: many changes in the way you feel, think or act are temporary. </strong>  You may take a class or listen to a podcast and feel a new resolve or a new way of thinking &ndash; that&rsquo;s a start, not the change.</p><p> <strong>  Personal Development MYTH #5: If you&rsquo;re not changing you&rsquo;re falling behind. </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;m all for a change having worked in the people side of change management since the early 1990&rsquo;s; however, constant change can leave you spinning.  <strong>  Change needs time for assimilation. </strong>  Some people try to  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/change-life-change-story/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   make huge changes  </a> </u> , one after another with no time for reflection, understanding or stickiness. Many of these people are moving forward, but only at a very superficial level;  you deserve more.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s reframe the concept of change and focus on growth.  Are you deepening your understanding of yourself and the world? Are you expanding your go-to knowledge, thoughts and behaviors?  If you answered, &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re right where you need to be. If you answered, &ldquo;who has time for that inner-work mumbo-jumbo?&rdquo; check out the next personal development myth below.</p><p> <strong>  Personal Development Bonus MYTH: Personal Development is all Woo Woo &ndash; not for us serious folks. </strong></p><p> I know people who teach deep breathing to their clients over the phone. Do you have time for that? If you said &ldquo;no way!&rdquo; you&rsquo;re not alone. There are a range of books, ideas and practitioners out there, and you can&rsquo;t lump it all under one umbrella. Personal development lies on a spectrum ranging from solely thinking about change to taking significant bold actions.</p><p> There are executive coaches, personal leadership coaches, life coaches, books and seminars that are meant for you, right where you are in your personal development.  <strong>  If you&rsquo;ve tried in the past and hit the wrong note, try again. </strong> <strong>  Ultimately, your success depends on it. </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=If+you+want+to+grow+and+improve%2C+stop+making+excuses+and+get+started+learning.+%23leadership&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/personal-development-myths/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   If you want to grow and improve, stop making excuses and get started learning. #leadership  </a> </u></p><h3> BREAK THE FRAME ACTION: <br/>  </h3><p> Be a Personal Development Myth Buster &ndash; create a framework for yourself to assess the impact of your personal development investment.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a quick and easy way to break down your personal development efforts and increase your learning integration and accountability.

{"original_id":2162,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Motivate Yourself","link":"how-to-motivate-yourself","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I had just finished reviewing the syllabus with my Masters level leadership class, and asked my typical follow-up question. &ldquo;What else would you like to cover?&rdquo; Lin raised her hand and asked sincerely, &ldquo;Professor, you are so passionate about what you do, it&rsquo;s oozing out of you. How do we motivate ourselves to feel like that?&rdquo;</p><p> Oh boy, a challenge.</p><p> You see this is the debate my husband, Marcus, and I have been having for the last 12 years. He swears that kind of motivation is genetic, and therefore, unteachable. If you met my family, you&rsquo;d see where his gene theory comes from. But still, I&rsquo;m passionate about proving him wrong. Yes, the irony is not lost on me.</p><p> I do know one thing, you can&rsquo;t give someone 5 steps to figuring it out. It involves miring in the muck of what drives you, what you value and why.</p><h3> From Motivation Theory to Real Life</h3><p> <br/> So last night, I told them to buckle their seat belts and took them on a tour of motivation theory. We started with the classics:  <a href=\"http://www.speechmastery.com/content-theory-of-motivation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   content   </u> </a> theories (what motivates),  <a href=\"http://www.strategies-for-managing-change.com/process-theories-of-motivation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   process  </u>    </a> theories (how to motivate) and of course good  <a href=\"http://managementstudyguide.com/reinforcement-theory-motivation.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   old reinforcement  </u>    </a> theory. We then moved to more current thinking like  <a href=\"http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=simon+sinek+why&amp;FORM=VIRE1#view=detail&amp;mid=3A95274017FC2CC800443A95274017FC2CC80044\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sinek  </u>    </a> and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pink  </a> </u> . I told them to take good notes because it would be on the exam (that&rsquo;s always a motivator.)</p><p> Then the real work began. I asked them to break into small groups and come up with five ways to help someone motivate themselves (all of which had to be grounded in at least one of the theories).</p><p> They started miring in the muck. I overheard deep conversation about where they get stuck and why: Childhood memories of reinforcement motivation for which they blame their bad habits, frustration of sending out so many resumes they have a hard time mustering up the gumption to send one more, questions of how they had let themselves turn from an athlete to a couch potato.</p><p> And so today I bring  you five ways to motivate yourself, courtesy of BUMO 796.</p><h3> 5 Ways to Motivate Yourself</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Love (my personal favorite) </strong></p><p> Connect with the feelings of love and sacrifice others have made for you. Acknowledge that support. Go get more if you need it. And then, turn that love into something spectacular. (P.S. this might not be unrelated to gene theory).</p><p> <strong>  2. Focus on Your Basic Needs First </strong></p><p> Work your way up Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy. If you need sleep and food, get that first. It&rsquo;s hard to be motivated to change the world if you&rsquo;re exhausted.</p><p> <strong>  3. Set Achieveable Goals </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectancy_theory\" target=\"_blank\">   Expectancy theory  </a> </u>  seemed to resonate.</p><p> <strong>  4. Create a Support Network </strong></p><p> Don&rsquo;t try to do this alone. Articulate your goals, and surround yourself with people who will help to keep you on track.</p><p> <strong>  5. Reward Yourself </strong></p><p> Give yourself something to look forward to at each milestone.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re feeling stuck, perhaps a good mire in motivation theory muck will help.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-22 18:49:06.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-22 18:49:06.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_FpKzFr6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-motivate-yourself/\", \"post_id\": \"4903\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-22 18:49:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-22 18:49:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-motivate-yourself\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4902\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2201\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/96516632_dfe685dc9c_z.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"437\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437648300,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2161,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Misconceptions About Social Security","link":"misconceptions-about-social-security","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It is the most important source of retirement income for most workers. Yet too many older Americans lack a basic understanding of certain aspects of Social Security benefits.</p><p> In fairness, many people got some key questions right in a survey that quizzed them about the program&rsquo;s rules and incentives. But a significant minority, and sometimes a majority, revealed a poor understanding of several major features of the program. As the researchers note, misunderstanding Social Security benefits could lead to poor financial decisions about retirement.</p><p> They analyzed responses by more than 2,300 people &ndash; all between ages 50 and 70 &ndash; to a nationally representative survey administered online in 2008. The survey, which took about half an hour, started with basic demographic questions before moving to various questions about components of the Social Security program.</p><p> Brief explanations of some program features appear below, followed by the percentage of survey respondents who provided incorrect answers, according to the researcher&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w20562\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   analysis  </a> </u>  of the results:</p><li> The U.S. Social Security Administration calculates pensions using a formula based on the average of a worker&rsquo;s 35 highest years of earnings.

{"original_id":2160,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Truth or Tragedy: Lessons for Leaders From King Lear","link":"truth-or-tragedy-lessons-for-leaders-from-king-lear","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it. &ndash; Flannery O&rsquo;Connor</p><p> This winter,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Canada&rsquo;s Stratford Festival  </a> </u>  partnered with movie theaters across North America to show a filmed performance of one of their critically acclaimed productions: King Lear. I was delighted to experience the play again and took a few new insights with me as I left the theater.</p><p> While the play &ndash; one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s most beloved tragedies &ndash; is ripe with lessons for fathers and kings alike, it also demonstrates with terrible accuracy the dangers leaders in business face when they value flattery over truth.</p><p> Early in the play, King Lear shares his plan to give up responsibility for leadership and governance to his daughters, but retain all of the pomp and benefits for himself ( What could possibly go wrong with this strategy? ). It is here that Lear makes what will prove to be a fatal error. He demands that his daughters first speak their love of him, saying that he will give the greatest share of the kingdom to she who loves him most.</p><p> His eldest daughters Goneril and Regan outdo each other with over-the-top declarations (&ldquo; dearer than eyesight, space and liberty &rdquo;) and are given their shares as compensation. However, Lear&rsquo;s youngest and dearest daughter refuses to speak. She says that she loves him as a daughter, but that she cannot, as her sisters have &ldquo;heave my heart into my mouth.&rdquo; Lear is furious and banishes Cordelia &ndash; and the loyal and perhaps overly direct Kent &ndash; from his heart and kingdom. From then on, only Lear&rsquo;s fool speaks truth.</p><p> As leaders, what lessons can we take from Lear?</p><p> The first is the importance of  <strong>  self-awareness </strong> . Know your strengths, respect your weaknesses, and continuously evaluate your own behaviors and the results they create. Share your areas of personal development with your team and ask them to call you out when you don&rsquo;t follow through with your commitments. Be aware of your ego and its inherent danger.</p><p> Next,  <strong>  demand truth </strong>  from your team, not flattery. Give your team permission to speak truth to you, even when it is uncomfortable and inconvenient. Commit to model truth-telling yourself, creating an environment where your team is rewarded, not punished, for it. As Shakespeare writes through the voice of Edgar, &ldquo;Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.&rdquo;</p><p> Finally, understand in your business who your Gonerils and Cordelias are (each business has them) and  <strong>  manage your talent </strong>  accordingly. Take good care when you know your personal feelings may get in the way. Seek out the direct-talking Kents and heed their advice, even when it is hard.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22Who+is+your+team%27s+Goneril%3F+Are+you+listening+to%C2%A0Kent%3F%22&amp;via=brandforgingco&amp;related=brandforgingco&amp;url=http://brandforging.co/truth-or-tragedy-lessons-for-leaders-from-king-lear/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Who is your team&rsquo;s Goneril? Are you listening to Kent?  </u>  &rdquo; </a></p><p> There is much to learn about business and leadership from King Lear, in fact in many of Shakespeare&rsquo;s great plays. Self-reflective leaders would do well to add a quarto or two to their summer reading list. And Stratford would do well to set their next Lear in the boardroom instead of England&rsquo;s fair fields.</p><p> <u>  Haley Boehning </u>  is the Chief Change Officer at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.storyforge.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Storyforge  </a> </u> .

{"original_id":2159,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Financial Services Dying in Japan or Simply an Untapped Opportunity","link":"is-financial-services-dying-in-japan-or-simply-an-untapped-opportunity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Despite living in Asia for three years (2009-2012), we never managed to make our way up to Japan, for business nor pleasure.  Fortunately, earlier this month I had an opportunity to spend a week meeting with our local Capgemini team in Japan, as well as about 40 different banking, insurance, and wealth executives ranging from the large local incumbents to multi-nationals who continue to try to chip away at the stronghold the local players have held. </p><p> One of my objectives of the week was to get deeper insights into why customer experience levels (identified in our annual  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.worldretailbankingreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Retail Banking Report  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.worldinsurancereport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Insurance Report  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.worldwealthreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Wealth Report  </a> </u> ) have been so much lower in Japan than the rest of the world.</p><p> <strong>  Are Japanese customers impossible to please or are FSIs simply failing to deliver on expectations? </strong></p><p> In the market research I have done over the past decade, Japan has always stood out as a bit of an anomaly.  It&rsquo;s a huge market, dominated by local players, who seem to have the least satisfied financial services clients across the globe.  Every year, Japanese customers consistently fall in the bottom rankings of customer experience &ndash; whether it banking, insurance or wealth management. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Banking: </strong> <br/></p><p> <strong>  Insurance: </strong> <br/></p><p> <strong>  Wealth: </strong> <br/></p><p> For years, we have partly chalked it up to cultural influence (recognizing customer experience is a combination of both what actual user experience is being delivered and what expectations customers bring with them into those experiences).  Maybe Japanese customers simply never feel comfortable giving very high ratings when it comes to satisfaction and experience-related questions or have unrealistic expectations?  </p><p> After this week&rsquo;s visit to Tokyo, my conviction is that is really only one piece of the explanation.  There was certainly general consensus over the impact culture had on our research results.  Generally, the Japanese population is very demanding with high expectations.  However, using that as an excuse to explain away the results of our research may be letting financial institutions in Japan off the hook a little too easily.</p><p> The reality is that despite the size and maturity of the Japanese financial services sector, the industry has done very little to evolve and digitally transform over the past two decades (even more so than the rest of the world).  The industry overall is still heavily dependent on branches, agents, and advisers.  Very little investment has been made in bringing the FS sector into the digital world, despite at the same time a Japanese population experiencing rapid adoption of digital in their day-to-day lives.</p><p> For years, Japanese firms have stood by the position that there is no need to make large investments in digital for the simple fact there is very little demand for it coming from their clients.  Over the course of the week, I heard many executives explain the Japanese people are different.  They value the personal relationship and the physical experience.  The little investments they have made in digital have never resulted in very strong adoption rates.   <br/> <br/> The reality is, Japanese customers have been slower to pick up digital channels.  Globally, nearly two-thirds (65.1%) of customers use Internet at least weekly to interact with their banks vs. only 39.3% in Japan.  The contrast is greater for mobile channel with only 13.4% of Japanese interacting with their banks at least weekly vs. 30.5% globally.  But the real question is this more due to a lack of demand or a poor supply of digital capabilities.</p><br /><p> Now, to their defense, the Japanese population is experiencing a different demographic shift than many other regions.  The population is shrinking and getting older (and doing so quickly).  I've read some estimates have overall population in Japan dropping 30% by 2060.  The demand and pressures coming from the younger generation simply hasn&rsquo;t applied the same type of business imperative on the FS industry like it has in emerging markets, or even Europe and the Americas.  I suppose to a certain extent they were not completely off-base.  However, I do believe the likes of Amazon, Google, and Apple may change that.</p><p> <strong>  Can Japanese banks and insurers learn from Swiss private bankers? </strong></p><p> I do believe the tide is turning.  My conversations this week brought me back to meetings I had when I was living in Paris running our Financial Services Lab 10 years ago.  One study we did back in 2005 was looking at the role of digital in the Wealth Management space.  At the time, U.S. firms were starting to make investments in the online channel to serve the high net worth segment (and the mass affluent).  We published a white paper &ldquo;Debunking 10 Myths of Why Wealth Management Will Not Adopt Digital&rdquo;. </p><p> I still remember an interview I had with a senior executive at a Swiss private bank who called me out as an ignorant American who fundamentally doesn&rsquo;t understand how the Swiss private banking industry works.  He point blank told me that his high net worth clients will NEVER, EVER use the online channel to interact in any shape or form to manage their wealth (whether it is to check balances, make transfers, or search for investment advice).  Of course, fast forward 10 years later and that same institution is making huge investments in their digital channels and have identified it as a critical priority over the next three years. <br/> <br/> The reality is over half of high net worth individuals (over US$1 million in investable financial assets)  across all regions, even Japan, believe most or all of their wealth management relationship is already digital in 2014. <br/> <br/></p><p> My conversations this week in Japan had a very similar feel to the conversations I was having with Swiss private bankers back in 2005.  Many simply couldn&rsquo;t see a world where their clients (young or old) would want to interact through digital channels.  It was also interesting to see how disconnected many were from what was happening in financial services outside of Japan.  Almost all comparison and points of perspective came back to comparing themselves to other competitors in Japan.  That being said, you could start to see some genuine interest/concern on what is happening outside of Japan (especially as we start to see local firms branch out of Japan for international acquisitions) .  Even some of the traditional, conservative big banks and insurers of Japan were starting to leave open the possibility that they may need to start evolving digitally to meet the needs of the next generation.</p><p> <strong>  Digital adoption for retail in Japan is very high, how has it not translated to FS? </strong></p><p> As an American thinking of a stereotype of Japan, first that comes to mind is a technology rich, gadget-loving population.  And when you look at the adoption of digital channels in the Japanese retail sector, there is no reason to believe otherwise.  Amazon service, as impressive as it is in the U.S., is blown away by Japan.  Orders on Amazon placed in the morning can often be received by noon the same day.  Retail stores are becoming less and less visited as customers find it much more convenient to order online.</p><p> If that&rsquo;s true, how has it not translated across to the financial services sector?  One would think there would be a demand coming from customers.  One would think customers would have pushed back and voiced their dissatisfaction.  I think a big part of it is that customers simply don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know.  We saw similar results in our World Retail Banking Report a few years ago.  Banking customers ranked the importance of the mobile channel for banking very, very low.  However, as banks (and non-banks) have begun to advance the functionality of the mobile channel in banking, customers quickly realize the value.  The importance rating has risen very quickly the last two years.</p><p> A challenge in Japan is the country is relatively sheltered in the world of financial services from what is happening outside of Japan.  Many bank executives, never mind banking customers, have little awareness of how quickly new channels and services are evolving outside of Japan.  However, the world is becoming smaller and the younger generation in Japan is starting to look for more &ndash; hence the very low (and declining) customer experience results.</p><p> The results coming from our Retail Banking and Insurance Customer Experience Indices show just how low Japan ranks in the world.  It is becoming harder and harder for one to believe customers in Japan are really getting what they want from their banks and insurers.  While executives in Japan may not see digital as a burning platform today, I believe there are those willing to make some calculated investments in delivering personalized customer experiences in the way their customers want to interact.  On the banking side, we've even started to see an a significant increase in negative experiences.  This is something we have not seen in other markets to-date. <br/> <br/></p><p> Technology adoption in Japan happens very quickly.  This may be just the opportunity multi-nationals have been looking for to crack the code to gain substantial market share in Japan.  If they can leverage the experiences and lessons learned in their home markets (and markets across the globe), they can bring these leading practices to a Japanese market that is underserved.  However, that timeline may not be long-lived.  I believe the large, local institutions are slowly starting to acknowledge that change will be required given the evolving dynamics in Japan. </p><p> It will be interesting to see how things play out over the coming years.   The FS environment in Japan certainly has its challenges, but with challenges comes great opportunity.  In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll enjoy a dram of the very nice single malt Japanese whiskey I discovered (and brought home) from the trip. <br/> <br/> Side note - One area where Tokyo did not disappoint was the hotel's exec lounge airing my Red Sox (in Japanese) on a local channel as I had breakfast one morning. <br/> <br/></p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-22 18:29:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-22 18:29:48.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_jR6ZnfX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-financial-services-dying-in-japan-or-simply-an-untapped-opportunity/\", \"post_id\": \"4897\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-22 18:29:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-22 18:29:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-financial-services-dying-in-japan-or-simply-an-untapped-opportunity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4896\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2198\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAN6AAAAJDBkZDc3NmU3LWJiNjAtNGNjNy1iODI0LWU5OTE0NmQ5NDJhYw.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1058\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437656400,"author_id":63,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2157,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Does “Community\" Mean for B2B Digital Marketing?","link":"what-does-community-mean-for-b2b-digital-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> B2B businesses often approach social media marketing with an attitude that &ldquo;bigger is better.&rdquo; They eagerly believe that the more followers, the better. The more likes, the better. The more tweets at more times in the day, the better.</p><p> However, effective B2B digital marketing is not a clear-cut numbers game. In fact, smaller numbers are sometimes better ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/why-website-traffic-doesnt-matter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   so long as they convert  </a> </u> ) because that means you&rsquo;re targeting the right attention for your blog and social media. Why? The reason that smaller is better comes down to a hot digital marketing topic for social 2015: community.</p><h3> What Is Community?</h3><p> <br/> The standard definition of a community is a group of people with similar backgrounds and goals. In digital marketing, however, community refers to the small but potent group of fans and peers that make up your client base and B2B business network. Infamous marketing thinker Seth Godin refers to this kind of community as a tribe, or a group of people who connect with each other because they share an idea and a leader.</p><p> Successful B2B digital marketing doesn&rsquo;t strive to add zeroes to your follower counts. Instead, its goal is to attract and engage your tribe &mdash; the people who are actually paying attention and actively seeking information. And if you do it right, you might find yourself adding zeroes to your follower counts anyway&hellip; except this time these followers will represent targeted prospective customers rather than empty seats.</p><p> The Social Media Marketing Podcast recently interviewed Jared Easley, co-founder of the industry-leading podcasting conference Podcast Movement, about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-groups-with-jared-easley/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   creating a community  </a> </u> . In the interview, Jared talked about how he used Facebook to build a community of followers who eventually funded his $11,000 Kickstarter campaign. This may not be the best way to raise money for your B2B business, but it does go to show the power of uniting your tribe to achieve a specific goal.</p><h3> How to Identify Your Community</h3><p> <br/> Building your community starts with understanding who makes up your community. Take a look at your customers and the customers of your competitors. Where do they spend their time online? When you&rsquo;ve identified these demographics, it&rsquo;s a simple matter of researching their social usage by  <u>  income </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digit-ally.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/demographics-social.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   age and gender  </a> </u> , or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.topinteractiveagencies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/scmt1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   medium preference  </a> </u> . Armed with the knowledge of where people spend time online, you can target people who are most likely to be a good fit for your community.</p><p> Another great way to build your community is to use your personal network and your established customers. When you speak to them in person or by phone, ask them where they spend time online. Carefully monitor which links they share on their LinkedIn profiles. Keep a list of brands, publications, and sites they mention to paint a comprehensive picture of how your tribe prefers to spend time online.</p><h3> How to Connect With Your Community</h3><p> <br/> As the members of your community start to become more obvious, connect with them strategically. Arsen Rabinovich of TopHatRank shares a few pro steps in connecting with your audience on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter in his SEMrush blog post  <a href=\"http://www.semrush.com/blog/build-social-communities-strategies-for-smbs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Build Social Communities: Real World Strategies for SMBs  </u>  .&rdquo; </a>  Some of these strategies may entail a large initial time investment, but building your community will pay off in the long term.</p><p> Then consider your customer&rsquo;s day-to-day life and technology usage. How many tweets or LinkedIn posts will they see and engage with in a meaningful way? How much content do they want from you? How much content is too much for them? Make note of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/whats-the-best-time-of-day-for-promoting-your-social-media-message/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   best times to post  </a> </u>  and plan your B2B digital marketing strategy accordingly.</p><p> In B2B digital marketing, quality trumps quantity. Even a modest social media following can help you reach your sales goals if they represent a dedicated, engaged population. Find your community first, then guide your digital marketing efforts according to what they need.</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-21 20:35:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-21 20:35:34.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_PuT4dl8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-does-community-mean-for-b2b-digital-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"4893\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-21 20:35:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-21 20:35:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-does-community-mean-for-b2b-digital-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4892\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2196\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437482156760-d59ce7602fdf-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1192\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437570000,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2156,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"11 Ways To Overcome Self-Doubt & Fear of the Unknown","link":"11-ways-to-overcome-self-doubt-fear-of-the-unknown-2","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I certainly don&rsquo;t have all the answers, but over twenty five years in medical practice, I have seen a lot, learned a lot, and feel I have gotten a pretty solid peak into the human condition. To be sure, not all of what I have learned is from my patients. My life has moved alongside my career and with it has developed my own self-awareness and understanding.</p><p> When one comes to me for medical help, often the physical complaint stems from some life challenge. Whatever the challenge, the two emotions that seem to upset a person&rsquo;s balance most are anger and sadness, let&rsquo;s even say depression.</p><p> And this is the way I see it. Humankind, that means you, me&hellip;everyone, possesses a duality: a primitive (animalistic) nature and a Divine nature. The former dominates most of our life and human interaction. It is controlled by what I have dubbed the Automatic Brain (or AB). This AB has been with us for more than 200 thousand years, past down from our evolutionary ancestors, way back to reptiles. This brain inspects the landscape 24/7, in effort to detect any danger, threat, or vulnerability. When it detects such, it causes us, automatically and instantaneously, to fight or flee. Therefore, any fight-or-flight reaction must have some danger behind it; in other words, a trigger.</p><p> The way I see it, Anger is always a fight reaction, and sadness or depression a flight reaction. One is not better or worse than the other, just that the AB had to detect a situation in which, to that individual, some danger, threat, or vulnerability had to be around.</p><p> These dangers, threats, and vulnerabilities about which I speak, are usually not so obvious as a saber-toothed tiger (50-thousand years ago) or a mugger in our modern day. No, the dangers this AB detects are stored in its data banks beginning in our childhood.</p><p> The dynamic of the AB is as follows: Sensory Stimuli (external or internal) hits the AB&gt;The AB matches it against data it has stored&gt;If it indicates possible danger&gt;fight and/or flight (the only protective action for which it is programmed). And the AB will do whatever it takes, by all means necessary to make the danger go away by either fighting or fleeing.</p><p> For everyone, the dangers are slightly different. However, there are some universal dangers. One is the danger of the unknown. The future is the greatest unknown of all and our AB tries desperately to arrange it in a fashion so that it is predictable. That is one reason why we have trouble staying in the moment; in the present. Nevertheless, our inability to predict the future often leads us to fear it, or stated a little differently, often leads our AB to detect it as potential danger. Therefore, the unpredictability of the future&mdash;financial concerns, relationship concerns, health concerns&mdash;can trigger us and cause fight or flight. Anger can be a way the fight shows up and depression can be a way the flight shows up.</p><p> Another universal danger is that of being one-upped. Our AB will monitor our surroundings for anyone or anything that might be superior to us, and therefore a potential threat. Well what if, due to data stored from our childhood, our AB detects almost everyone and everything to be superior to us? This we see in low self-esteem causing self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy.  In these situations, our AB will have us fleeing such. To get us to flee, it may generate self-sabotaging thoughts in order to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; us from threatening situations or people.</p><p> Happiness is elusive when we are constantly fighting and fleeing. In order to access our Divine nature, we must get beyond the AB. Here are some ways to do that.</p><h3> Overcome Fear of the Unknown <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Take one step at a time </strong></p><p> This seems obvious, but usually the possibility of danger has us trying to predict the future in an effort to protect us.</p><p> <strong>  2. Don&rsquo;t worry about being the best, just focus on doing your best </strong></p><p> When each step is precise and determined and in alignment with our individual abilities, gifts, and talents (not someone else&rsquo;s) it will lead to a future that is right for us.</p><p> <strong>  3. Take action today </strong></p><p> Ask yourself, &ldquo;What am I going to do today that will move me in the direction of my best future?&rdquo; Then take one step today, another tomorrow, and keep moving forward with courage and determination.</p><p> <strong>  4. Get organized </strong></p><p> As you take steps, write down what you have learned from the previous step and what your immediate goals are to follow up.</p><p> <strong>  5. Don&rsquo;t plan too far in the future </strong></p><p> Since your AB detects the future as potentially dangerous, avoid planning too far in advance. Dreams and goals that are so grandiose can appear too &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; or daunting and may cause you to fight and flee too much, never reaching them.</p><h3> Overcome self-doubt <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Begin to understand that self-doubt is a learned response </strong></p><p> Our AB simply wants to protect us. Even though it can generate thoughts to help do this, it does not think. It only reacts. When self-doubt becomes familiar and we feel weak, it will always cause us to fight and flee strength, since that is unfamiliar, unknown.</p><p> <strong>  2. Practice not believing, trusting, or taking direction from feelings of inadequacy  </strong></p><p> Just because this may be all you know, understand that it was formulated somewhere in your development and means nothing. It is only stored data. Begin creating a new set of data.</p><p> <strong>  3. Embrace previous success </strong></p><p> Often when we experience something that we view as success, it is quickly explained as a fluke or luck. The way to create new data is to understand that that success, however big or small you may view it, could not have occurred without your participation. Don&rsquo;t dig your heals in and try to find reasons to prove otherwise.</p><p> <strong>  4. Understand that all successful people doubt themselves </strong></p><p> The difference is that they are successful because they continue to move forward and view the doubt as more of a fluke than the success.</p><p> <strong>  5. Develop a mantra when you feel weak or vulnerable </strong></p><p> I use the mantra, &ldquo;There is no danger; there is no threat.&rdquo; I say this, relentlessly, in my head many times a day!</p><p> <strong>  6. Downtime motivation </strong></p><p> The average commuter spends 38 hours a year stuck in traffic. Try listening to motivational and inspirational radio or digital media. When you are surfing the net or spending time on Facebook, occupy your time on similar content.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-11-12 19:27:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-11-12 19:27:56.000000","image_url":"2015/11/article_placeholder.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/11-ways-to-overcome-self-doubt-fear-of-the-unknown-2/\", \"post_id\": \"7419\", \"post_date\": \"2015-11-12 19:27:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-11-12 19:27:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"11-ways-to-overcome-self-doubt-fear-of-the-unknown-2\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7418\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3440\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/photo-1447125771574-df004a56c69c-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"537\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/11/survive-thrive-digital-age-financial-services/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1447416000,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2155,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Most Job Descriptions STINK – Here's How to Write them Including the Big Benefits","link":"most-job-descriptions-stink-heres-how-to-write-them-including-the-big-benefits","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Job descriptions are a vital component to hiring and managing your team. They provide consistency and clarity and help ensure new hires and seasoned employees understand what is expected of them, how their role contributes to firm goals, and when and how they will be evaluated.</p><p> Most job descriptions are written from a previous employee and reflect an inflated &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; list of what needs to get done. Ultimately, job descriptions should be carefully crafted and include an actual illustration of what, why, and how employees can reach specific goals.</p><p> Furthermore, each position should be dissected to determine the behaviors, attitudes, and values an employee needs to be successful. These characteristics should be harmonious with the values, mission, and strategic intent of your firm.</p><p> If done well, the time invested in defining the company roles and responsibilities can improve moral and motivation. The alternative exposes you to legal liabilities, confusion, and lower productivity.</p><h3> The Benefits</h3><p> <br/> A well written job description will:</p><li> Help attract qualified candidates</li><li> Describe the key areas of an employee&rsquo;s position so employees know what is expected of them</li><li> Define desired characteristics</li><li> Provide structured communication</li><li> Serve as a basis for outlining performance expectations, training, compensation, and career advancement <br/>  </li><h3> What to Include in a Job Description</h3><p> <br/> Job descriptions need to remain flexible. Roles and positions evolve over time and job descriptions need to follow suit   to allow room for employee growth, firm development, and the evolution of new technology.</p><p> Each job description should include the following components:</p><h3> Job Title</h3><p> <br/> If required, ensure job titles are approved by your compliance department.</p><h3> Summary Statement</h3><p> <br/> Two or three sentences describing and summarizing the purpose or objective of the position.</p><h3> Functions and Responsibilities</h3><p> <br/> Outline the details of what the job entails and all roles the employee will hold. This should include the scope of leadership, any supervisory roles, the reporting structure, as well as the levels of supervision and independent judgement. An important feature to include in a job description is &ldquo;other duties as assigned.&rdquo; By including this statement in a job description, you can add new tasks as they arise.</p><h3> Experience/Qualification</h3><p> <br/> This list describes the level of skill, education, and knowledge required for the position. Include any other required attributes and insights into how they match the culture of your organization.</p><h3> Evaluation Methods</h3><p> <br/> Evaluate performance accurately based on the expectations of the position. Identify what is most important for the employee and the organization. Include details on when evaluations will take place &ndash; for example: SWOT, 360-degree feedback, or performance reviews.  Identify how the assigned duties play an important role in reaching firm goals and illustrate how employees will be eligible for advancement.</p><h3> Compensation</h3><p> <br/> Provide a concise view of how employees will be compensated broken down into base salary, benefits, and other investments such as employee training. This allows management to reward performance and the development of skills while controlling overall base salary costs by providing a cap on the range paid for  specific jobs. Listing a salary range instead of an exact figure will give you more flexibility.

{"original_id":2154,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Six Personal Traits That Help Women Successfully Survive Divorce","link":"the-six-personal-traits-that-help-women-successfully-survive-divorce","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Every woman who walks into our office wants an answer to the exact same question. She wants to know this: Will my family &ndash;both me and my children &ndash;be financially OK after the divorce?</p><p> To help answer that question, I advise all my clients on the importance of assembling a  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?p=275\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  skilled, experienced divorce team </a> . We talk about what they need to do in order to get their  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?p=349\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  personal credit and finances in order </a> . And, we discuss &ldquo;the divorce basics,&rdquo; such as  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?p=293\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the difference between separate and marital property </a> , etc.</p><p> But, what comes next? If you&rsquo;re going through divorce, is there anything else you can do to keep the odds in your favor?</p><p> Well, interestingly enough, over the years, I have noticed that certain personality traits seem to serve women particularly well during the throes of divorce. Women with these qualities seem to emerge from divorce in relatively good shape, and they start their single lives with determination and vigor.</p><p> With these women in mind, I&rsquo;ve compiled a short list of the six key personal traits I think can help you successfully survive divorce.</p><p> While you are going through divorce, you need to make best efforts to:</p><p> <strong>  Put your emotions on the back burner. </strong>   As I tell every one of our clients, it is absolutely critical that you learn to  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Think Financially, Not Emotionally&reg;  </u>  . </a>  Of course, that&rsquo;s easier said than done. Going through divorce is a personal struggle on multiple levels, and it&rsquo;s only natural that you are going to have strong emotions, especially when it comes to issues concerning your children. Still, you simply must work to keep your feelings in check as much as possible. That&rsquo;s the only way you can think clearly about the important financial decisions ahead of you &mdash; and those decisions are significant. In fact, decisions you make during your divorce often have the potential to impact you for the rest of your life. Clearly, this is not the time to take actions that are based on revenge or malice . . . or even sadness, for that matter. Instead, you have to be objective and practical. As someone once said, &ldquo;Marriage is all about love. But, divorce is all about money.&rdquo; You have to make calculated, smart moves, ones that point you in the direction of a stable financial future.</p><p> <strong>  Maintain your cool under pressure. </strong> Emotions are bound to run high at some point during your divorce, and when that time comes, your best bet is always going to be to remain calm, cool and collected. This is especially true, if/when you appear in front of a judge. Losing your composure or having outbursts of anger may severely compromise your case &ndash;and your husband&rsquo;s attorney knows it.</p><p> I know it sounds like a terribly insensitive strategy, but getting you to lose your composure and show anger is a common tactic of many divorce attorneys. By constantly pressing your buttons (and going over the same issue over and over again), your husband&rsquo;s attorney is hoping that you will lose your cool. Then, he can say you have anger issues and that your temper makes you an unfit mother. Even worse,  if you have been a victim of domestic abuse, your husband&rsquo;s attorney can use your outburst to make the claim that your husband was the victim of your abuse and that he was only protecting himself. Believe it or not, this happens all the time! Obviously, keeping your cool and maintaining your composure is critical, especially in custody battles and/or domestic abuse cases.</p><p> <strong>  Delegate. </strong> Divorce may be tough, but you don&rsquo;t have to go through it alone. Recognize that you need help &ndash;for legal issues, financial matters and emotional concerns &ndash;and then organize a top-notch divorce team that can deliver results. Issue tasks according to professional abilities, so you can devote more of your time and your energy on taking care of yourself and your family.</p><p> <strong>  Keep a healthy focus on the future. </strong> Anyone who is going through divorce has to keep their sights trained on the future. Realize that no matter how horrible things are now, ultimately, you and your kids will be okay. There is life after divorce . . .  and with the proper planning, your single life can be productive, fulfilling and financially secure and stable, as well.</p><p> <strong>  Stay organized. </strong>  Divorce proceedings require you to juggle many things simultaneously. Therefore, it&rsquo;s imperative that you stay organized.  Since you&rsquo;ll have to keep track of appointments, paperwork and deadlines, it may make sense to invest in a strategy to help you keep organized. For some women, that may mean it&rsquo;s time to upgrade to a smartphone or buy a new home computer. These days, there are many great programs and apps that can help you keep track of your appointments and stay organized. (But remember:  Make sure your husband didn&rsquo;t install any spyware on your electronic devices).  Other women may opt for a more low-tech approach, such as a pocket calendar. In any event, do not keep your important papers at home or any place where your husband may have access to them. You will need to obtain a safe deposit box, or store your important papers with a trusted friend or relative.</p><p> As  <a href=\"http://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=10&amp;bioID=5077\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Marilyn Chinitz  </u>  ,  <u>   Partner at Blank Rome  </u> </a> , points out, staying organized can help you make smart decisions about your future.</p><p> &ldquo;Keep monthly statements of your bank, brokerage and retirement accounts. Keep copies of the joint returns filed. Keep records of your credit card charges, all of which should be independently maintained by you, not your spouse or his accountant, &rdquo; Marilyn advises. &ldquo;No one knows more about you, your children and your expenses than you do, and when you are armed with accurate, up-to- the- minute information, you are a formidable and impressive opponent who makes decisions that are right for you and your children.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Educate yourself. </strong> Divorce involves the scrutiny of every aspect of your personal and family finances. Make sure you know all these details, so you develop a working knowledge of your financial circumstances. In addition, make a commitment to understand divorce terminology and how your state&rsquo;s divorce laws apply to you. This may seem like a daunting task, at first, but you&rsquo;ll be glad you made the extra effort.</p><p> &ldquo;Knowledge is power,&rdquo; Marilyn concludes.  &ldquo;A successful divorce is dependent upon how invested you are in knowing about you and your spouse&rsquo;s financial circumstances, so don&rsquo;t wait until the word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; is mentioned to learn the answers to critical questions, such as:</p><li> What are your assets?</li><li> What does it cost to maintain your lifestyle?</li><li> What are your expenses?</li><li> What will it cost to send the children to college?</li><li> What are your liabilities?</li><li> How and where are your assets held?</li><li> Is there a life insurance policy to protect you and the children? <br/>  </li><p> If you educate yourself now, which you should do regardless of your marital status, you are guaranteed to survive the difficulties of divorce.  Take out the unknown and provide your attorney and  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  divorce financial advisor </a>  with concrete information in order to obtain the results you want to achieve in the divorce.&rdquo;</p><p> Nurturing these six personal traits can help you survive divorce both emotionally and financially. Remember: there are two different ways to look at divorce. On the one hand, divorce can be financially disastrous. But, on the other hand, divorce can be the opportunity to lock in a secure financial future. The difference lies in how you handle the process.</p><p> Team up with an  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  experienced financial ally </a> , and you&rsquo;ll be able to approach this major life change with confidence. First, you&rsquo;ll need to shore up your financial position so you can enter the divorce process prepared. Then, you&rsquo;ll need to develop a solid strategy to help you emerge from your divorce in the best financial shape possible and face your future with confidence.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-21 20:18:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-21 20:18:46.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_AQqEiY9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-six-personal-traits-that-help-women-successfully-survive-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"4887\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-21 20:18:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-21 20:18:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-six-personal-traits-that-help-women-successfully-survive-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4886\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2193\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437447541244-e0c70b55adad-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"526\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1448631000,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2153,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Stubbornness and Strategy: Birds of a Feather","link":"stubbornness-and-strategy-birds-of-a-feather","source_link":null,"content":"<p> From as far back as my days in brand management, I have held a deep affection for strategy. This might have something to do with the fact that I can be stubborn. Good strategists are also stubborn, even pigheaded. Why is that? Because without strategic stubbornness, the hard barrier lines that contain the strategy will blur. And when a brand or company&rsquo;s positioning blurs, customers become confused. That&rsquo;s never a good thing. Loose strategies jeopardize an organization&rsquo;s specificity, hindering cultures built on, and committed to focus. Focused companies don&rsquo;t fret about &ldquo;doing more with less.&rdquo; Focused companies thrive by &ldquo;doing less, better.&rdquo;</p><h3> Tight Strategies Don&rsquo;t Limit Opportunity. They Create It.</h3><p> <br/> Despite the necessity for precision in purpose and direction, I see more and more examples of senior business executives operating non-strategically. We used to refer to this modus operandi as &ldquo;doing business by the seat of the pants.&rdquo; Seat-of-the-pants leaders chase every opportunity that might increase sales. Like chickens running around with their heads chopped off, these busy, misdirected leaders either don&rsquo;t understand strategy, believe strategy is a deterrent to opportunity, or have never experienced the strategic disciplines of a prudent mentor.</p><p> Truth is, they have never realized nor enjoyed the sales and profit rewards that come from walking away from non-strategic ventures in the name of maintaining the integrity of focus. Strategy is critical to clarity. Without it, the complexity virus infects every nook and cranny of the organization. Left unchecked, that virus will stifle, stagnate, and bring a company to its knees.</p><h3> The Best Strategies Require Sacrifice</h3><p> <br/> Giving up something of value for the sake of other considerations is the essence of strategic sacrifice. Strategies that emerge from consciously passing on certain markets, products, and brand benefits improves performance because  <strong>  they tell you what not to do </strong> . Coca-Cola, unlike PepsiCo, steers clear of anything that isn&rsquo;t a non-alcoholic beverage. The reward for this strategic stubbornness is profits and market capitalization that greatly exceed Coke&rsquo;s much larger competitor who market food under the Frito Lay and Quaker Oats portfolios.</p><p> Once stubborn strategists carve out their course of action, the wisest of the owls stick to it like crazy glue. They don&rsquo;t seek out the infinite, untapped opportunities at the top of  Mount Elsewhere . They want to know how to best trek  Mount Here , the vista everyone on the team agreed to climb in the first place. Why? Because, at the top of  Mount Here  is the pot of gold.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-21 20:13:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-21 20:13:56.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Qjl6sFb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/stubbornness-and-strategy-birds-of-a-feather/\", \"post_id\": \"4885\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-21 20:13:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-21 20:13:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"stubbornness-and-strategy-birds-of-a-feather\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4884\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2192\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/canada-geese-348290_640.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"847\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437568200,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}

As of June 30, oil posted gains of over 11 percent, rising to $59.47 per barrel. After falling more than 50 percent since last summer, though, it had little else to go but up. That oil claimed the top spot just highlights the reality that commodities are in a slump right now.</p><img alt=\"Crude-Oil-Was-2015-Best-Performing-Commodity-As-Of-June-30\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-17/COMM-crude-oil-was-2015-best-performing-commodity-as-of-June-30-07142015.jpg\"/><p> Case in point: This week, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) retreated to $50 per barrel, putting it back in the red for the year. This move was largely in response to Greece&rsquo;s debt dilemma,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/chinas-market-correction-in-three-easy-charts/#.VaksMv50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   China&rsquo;s slowdown  </a> </u>  and  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/global-investors-you-should-be-paying-attention-to-this-economic-indicator/#.VaksVf50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   weakening PMI numbers  </u>  . </a>  After the JPMorgan Global Manufacturing &amp; Services PMI was released, showing a continued downtrend in manufacturing activity, oil almost immediately dropped $4. The lifting of sanctions on Iran, if approved by Congress, could also place downward pressure on WTI, with some analysts seeing it returning to the $40s range.</p><p> As the 800-pound commodity gorilla, China greatly contributes to the performance of oil. Its own PMI reading remains below the key 50 threshold, indicating that its manufacturing sector is in contraction mode. This has a huge effect on the consumption of oil and other important commodities.</p><p> The good news is that the projected crude price for the remainder of 2015 should be high enough to support continued production in drilling areas such as the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian basins, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The oil rig count, as reported by Baker Hughes, has advanced for the third consecutive week, after 29 straight weeks of declines.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-17/COMM-number-of-US-gas-and-oil-rigs-climbs-for-three-consecutive-weeks-07172015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Number-of-US-gas-and-oil-rigs-climbs-for-three-consecutive-weeks\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-17/COMM-number-of-US-gas-and-oil-rigs-climbs-for-three-consecutive-weeks-07172015.gif\"/> </a></p><h3> King Corn Pops to the Top</h3><p> <br/> We all know that corn is in practically everything we eat and drink, from soda to bread to salad dressing. It&rsquo;s fed to livestock and poultry and used to make ethanol, plastic, glue and more. The grain is so ingrained in our lives that the U.S. government subsidizes it to the tune of $4.5 billion a year.</p><p> For this reason and more, American farmers favor corn. In 2013, a record amount of it was grown and sent to market, which resulted in a price decline of 40 percent. That year it was the worst-performing commodity.</p><p> Since then, corn has found its footing and, as of June 30, returned 4.28 percent.   </p><h3> Zinc Is Flying off Car Lots</h3><p> <br/> Sought for its anti-corrosive properties, zinc is staging a comeback and is set to make its longest run of gains in over a year, according to Mineweb.</p><p> <img alt=\"Strong European Car Sales Have Been a Boon for Zinc\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-17/COMM-strong-european-car-sales-have-been-a-boon-for-zinc-07172015.jpg\"/> <br/> The reason? Accelerating automobile sales in Europe. Zinc can be found in most car parts, from tires to door handles, and because it can store six times more energy per pound than more conventional battery systems, the metal is also used in electric vehicles. </p><p> The European Automobile Manufacturers Association reports that demand for new vehicles is up 14 percent year-over-year in June, its largest increase since December 2009. New car registrations in most European markets are seeing double-digit growth, with Portugal, Spain, Ireland and the Czech Republic leading the pack.</p><h3> Gold Demand in China Sparkles</h3><p> In a much-anticipated announcement, China broke its six-year silence on the amount of gold its central bank holds. And although the number jumped nearly 60 percent from 1,054 tonnes in 2009 to 1,658 tonnes, it underwhelmed the market, as many analysts had expected almost double the amount.

Don't shortchange the subtle power that comes from purposefully changing the subject of your attention in the middle of the week.</p><p> It's like peripheral vision, enabling you to see more angles on an idea or new dimensions of an issue when you're not looking directly at it. This may seem nonintuitive or odd, yet we all have these experiences--ideas that show up in the shower, or while we're pushing a child on the swing, playing a favorite game, or daydreaming during a long drive. As long as there is a connection to your portfolio of passions rather than just a focus on obligation or an attempted escape in wishful thinking, you can take advantage of what we call in our book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Success-Built-Last-Creating-Matters-ebook/dp/B000P28WEY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437071621&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Success+Built+To+Last\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Success Built To Last  </a> </u> , peripheral thinking. Peripheral thinking has a potential to connect you with a higher authority. Many people have a creative breakthroughs (a.k.a. Aha! moments) in prayer, or meditation, or even basketball.</p><p> \"I love the game,\" said lanky, athletic-looking  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Kovacevich\" target=\"_blank\">   Richard Kovacevich  </a> </u> , who has taken this principle to heart in his life and work. He said he has always been at his best when he applied what he learned on the basketball court to his many jobs such as formerly serving as president, chairman, and CEO of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wells Fargo &amp; Company  </a> </u> . Kovacevich was one of the most respected leaders in business at one of the most successful financial services companies in the world and has been sought after and served in several advisory roles including the Federal Reserves Federal Advisory Council.</p><p> \"I've made every mistake there is in life as a manger,\" he said. \"I was an engineer by background, although I got an MBA, but I have an MS in engineering. And as an engineer, I thought, just sit in a room with my slide rule and just run your linear program and the answer would pop out. Then just send the answer to the troops telling them what to do and it would get done. Well, in my first real job, I did all that and nothing happened,\" he said. He tried that a few times, \"And they nodded and said 'Yes,' and it still didn't happen. And then I said, 'Well gee, this is not working too well, is it?' And so you learn. And what you really find out is it's all about people. Although I was this geek, this engineer, I also spent four hours every day of my life for 21 years playing sports. You learn very quickly playing sports that it's all about (the) team. It's the best five players that win the basketball game, not the five best players. I learned more on the field of sports than I did in my calculus class. And you start applying those types of experiences, combined with business knowledge and you say, 'Wow, this is what it's all about.'\"</p><p> Another potential payoff from experimenting with peripheral thinking is that it might unlock a passion that is your secret talent or even a new specialty you've been unable or unwilling to reveal until a collection of passions all came colliding together--giving you a peek at what you'd rather be doing when the world isn't watching an not requiring you to pay bills. If at first you don't pressure yourself to take them too seriously--but do them anyway--a portfolio of passions may give you a unique opportunity to look honestly at things that you care about without your harshest critic--yourself--judging or dismissing what matters to you.</p><p> It's common knowledge that it requires focus to achieve a specific objective. But blind pursuit of just one thing is like searching for El Dorado. When you exclude all other things except a single focus for your life, there is a danger that you might find it impossible to locate the real treasure. Single-mindedness forces you to sideline passions that, with further development, could come together as your genius or eventually become your organization's core greatness.</p><p> We are not suggesting that you abandon all plans, scatter your efforts to the four winds, and become a wandering philosopher. It's just that being creative in your passions has a place in your life and work, with benefits that can't be forced or predicted. Peripheral thinking has the potential to catalyze a chemical reaction waiting within you--a set of passions that could move the world we share in the direction of goodness. Honor that part of yourself. Carve out a little time each week, on the job or after work, to experiment in some way with one of your other passions.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-21 18:37:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-21 18:37:44.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_YGpTfu9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/stealth-passion-and-the-power-of-peripheral-thinking/\", \"post_id\": \"4881\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-21 18:37:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-21 18:37:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"stealth-passion-and-the-power-of-peripheral-thinking\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4880\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2190\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437388914080-908608af1956-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1145\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437580800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2150,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Should You Get a Membership, or Not?","link":"should-you-get-a-membership-or-not","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharisseSays\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Charisse Conanan Johnson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://charissesays.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Charisse Says  </u> </a></p><p> Last week, I received an alert from Amazon to remind me of its first ever &ldquo;Prime Day&rdquo; &ndash; reserved for Prime members. I felt special and that I belonged to this exclusive Prime club. In commemoration of Amazon&rsquo;s 20-year anniversary, it announced &ldquo;Prime Day&rdquo; as a one-day only event filled with more deals than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members around the globe.</p><p> But when I went to buy things that I already had in my mind to buy, I could not find a deal anywhere. I felt right at home with all the #PrimeDayFail Tweeters. But Amazon had the last laugh &ndash;  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/business/amazon-says-prime-day-outdid-black-friday-in-unit-sales.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   the company sold more products on Prime Day than Black Friday in 2014  </u>  . </a></p><p> The experience compelled me to evaluate the memberships that I&rsquo;ve purchased.  <strong>  Have you ever had a hard time deciding whether you should keep (or invest in for the first time) a store membership that has an annual fee?  </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;m a big fan of purchasing memberships that produce a lot of value. Overall, I think there are 4 main factors in evaluating store memberships that have a fee attached:</p><li> <strong>  Re-coup annual fee. </strong>  You must ask yourself if you think you&rsquo;re going to recoup your annual membership fee through the savings that the membership promises on goods that you would have purchased anyway. For example, I pay $99 per year for an Amazon Prime membership, and I&rsquo;ve saved way more than $100 in shipping fees on gifts and products that I would have purchased in a physical retail location. <br/>  </li><p> If you find yourself buying many more items than you originally planned on, the retailer has done a marketing job on you. You are not getting a deal if you buy something that you did not intend to buy.</p><li> <strong>  Convenience and time saver. </strong>  Your time is often worth more than money because you cannot get it back. If a membership takes some of the stress off of your daily grind or prevents a trip to the store, then this has incredible value in your life. If a store&rsquo;s membership feels like an extra stressor, then are you really going to jump at the chance to use that stressor. <br/>  </li><p> I also have a Costco membership, which costs $55 annually and can be used at any worldwide Costco warehouse locations. I have to strategically plan my visit when lots of people are not there so I don&rsquo;t get overwhelmed by the crowds of people. In this case, I tend to re-evaluate my Costco membership every time I pull into the parking lot. And, I cannot seem to leave Costco without spending less than $150 even though I&rsquo;ll only go in there for 3 items but come out with many more.</p><p> On the other hand, my husband or I order something from Amazon at least once a week. And, I&rsquo;m sure the UPS worker who delivers our packages hates us &ndash; he has to climb four flights of stairs every time he comes to our building. The convenience of not having to go to the store or the post office to mail something is wonderful.</p><li> Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; most people like being part of an exclusive club that purportedly has benefits that others do not have. We feel like we&rsquo;re part of a special club with our other members. Amazon used this tactic to lure hundreds of thousands of new members on its Prime Day last week. Amazon hyped up the day so much that non-Prime members wanted in on the deal. <br/>  </li><p> I also have a United credit card membership that charges me $50 annually, and I have yet to feel exclusive through the membership. I still pay baggage fees and the value of my miles seems to go down every year. They&rsquo;ve got me cornered, however, because I&rsquo;ve had my United card since I was in college and I do not want to open another credit card and I want my miles; my switching costs are extremely high because I&rsquo;m already vested in the United brand.</p><li> <strong>  The public stock is appealing. </strong>  You should ask yourself if you would buy the underlying public stock of the company in addition (or in lieu of) the membership. Companies that have strong membership models tend to have very strong business models, which should help the public stock grow. Over the last 5 years, Amazon&rsquo;s stock has gone up over 300% and now trades at $477. The company earned $88 billion in revenue in its 2014 fiscal year. Amazon does not break-out its membership revenue nor specifically tell you its members, but it claims tens of millions of Prime members. As a guestimate, Amazon derives over $4 billion in revenue from its 40 million membership base. <br/>  </li><p> Costco&rsquo;s stock has gone up 167% and now trades at $144, and the company proudly boasts its 42 million paid cardholders and 663 warehouses. Of the company&rsquo;s $110 billion in sales in fiscal year 2014, $2.5 billion was derived in membership fees. Also, Costco&rsquo;s retention rate is approximately 87% worldwide.</p><p> Now, the market has gone up over the last five years too, but companies like Costco and Amazon have created a stickiness with their membership bases that cannot be ignored.</p><p> <strong>   What&rsquo;s a lady to do?  </strong></p><p> At this juncture, I&rsquo;m going to keep investing in my Amazon and United memberships, but I will probably kick Costco to the curb soon because I&rsquo;m not extracting a lot of value from the membership. You have to do what&rsquo;s right for you, but make sure your decision is an active one so that these companies earn their fees.</p><p> What investment (or not) will you make in an annual membership?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-21 18:22:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-21 18:22:18.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_EwfEeLb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/should-you-get-a-membership-or-not/\", \"post_id\": \"4879\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-21 18:22:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-21 18:22:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"should-you-get-a-membership-or-not\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4878\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2189\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ramp_Up_For_Amazon_Prime_Day_3148080000_20994020_ver1.0_640_480.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"648\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437592500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

In retrospect I would make it a three hump problem.  While awareness of the category is slowly creeping up &ndash; the figures I had for the event were 11% but a more recent study by AT Kearney now says 20% (this is in the US mind you) &ndash; we still face a largely disengaged audience to start with as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.luciancampconsulting.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lucian Camp  </a> </u>  warned us in his warm up to our session.That&rsquo;s a tall order if you are going to build what McKinsey called \"trust and intimacy\" in its recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riabiz.com/a/4984545384333312/mckinsey-robo-advisors-have-a-cloudy-future-but-virtual-advice-delivered-by-24-hour-super-centers-experts-and-algorithms-will-win-the-day\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   report  </a> </u>  for what is essentially a service not a product. Yet I remain an optimist. Consumers are prepared to entrusts things to the internet (not always wisely) that would have been unthinkable 5/10 years ago and we have reached a tipping point with mobile devices and their role in our lives connecting us 24/7 and changing our habits rapidly and irrevocably.The challenge for traditional companies is how to respond in a fast-changing world they decreasingly understand.  I have written previously on reverse mentoring and I would also refer everyone to  <u>  <a href=\"http://chiefmartec.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Scott Brinker&rsquo;s  </a> </u>  useful musings on marketing technology and its irritating inadequacies.In marketing terms my top five tips remain:</p><li> <strong>  Listening </strong>  &ndash; you cannot invest too much at this point in understanding your customers/clients and how their needs are changing. Established players will lose them to someone who understands them better if they don&rsquo;t and new players won&rsquo;t gather clients and assets unless their client experience really delivers what its target market wants and needs.</li><li> <strong>  Customer referral and advocacy </strong>  &ndash; Betterment is only five years old and already a third of its new business already comes from current clients. Active advocacy is not something wealth management firms have traditionally invested in leaving it largely in the hands of advisers but a less laissez faire approach may now be advisable.</li><li> <strong>  It&rsquo;s not just about finance </strong>  &ndash; we have tried for decades to get people excited about pensions and largely failed.

{"original_id":2148,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"These 8 Reasons Will Have You Hell-Bent on Employee Retention","link":"these-8-reasons-will-have-you-hell-bent-on-employee-retention","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A scary statistic thrown around is that it costs an organization 150% of an employee&rsquo;s salary to replace them &mdash; and even higher if that employee skews toward the senior side. But it isn&rsquo;t just a corporate urban legend. Employee turnover really can be that costly, or even more so.</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/06/22/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less/\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes  </a> </u> :</p><li> It costs between 30% and 50% of their annual salary to replace entry-level employees</li><li> It costs upward of 150% of their annual salary to replace mid-level employees</li><li> It costs upward of 400% of their annual salary to replace high-level or highly specialized employees <br/>  </li><p> To reiterate: 400%. That can be astronomical for many companies. To figure out just how essential employee retention should be to your company strategy and goals, look into the eight hidden costs of employee turnover and how the cost of continually replacing employees can be insurmountable over the long run.</p><p> First, we can look at the clearer or more obvious costs of having to replace an employee.</p><h3> #1: Seeking Out a Replacement</h3><p> <br/> Your organization may decide to pay an outside recruitment or headhunting firm. That&rsquo;s a flat rate over a certain period of time you will have to absorb into your budget &mdash; even if it&rsquo;s worth it to find the best employee for the empty role. However, even if you do all recruiting in-house, your staff will be burdened and need to get paid for their work. Maybe they&rsquo;ll work extra hours, or maybe your turnover rate is so high you have to invest in more human resources personnel. And if you&rsquo;re a small company, this expense can quickly get out of hand. No matter how you go about it, there will always be a dollar figure attached to the work of actually finding potential job candidates.</p><h3> #2: Interviewing Job Candidates</h3><p> <br/> Reading hundreds of resumes and interviewing a dozen candidates take a lot of time, and time, of course, is money. In addition to consuming your staff&rsquo;s time, especially if you&rsquo;re looking for senior-level, highly specialized job candidates, you will likely have to pay for airfare, transportation, and lodging for top talent to visit your offices for an interview &mdash; not to mention follow-up interviews. Costs can quickly add up.</p><h3> #3: Training New Hires</h3><p> <br/> In 2014, the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.td.org/Publications/Magazines/TD/TD-Archive/2014/11/2014-State-of-the-Industry-Report-Spending-on-Employee-Training-Remains-a-Priority\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Association for Talent Development  </a> </u>  found that the cost of training a single new hire averages $1,208, and it can go much higher for specialized industries or off-site seminars. And that doesn&rsquo;t take into account the time a manager or peer takes from their day to assist a new hire as they get adjusted to the new systems, software, and procedures. If your employee turnover is high, that number just increases exponentially.</p><p> The first three line items in the cost of employee turnover are some of the more outright costs, but there are more hidden costs that can add up to much, much more &mdash; and they&rsquo;re harder to calculate.</p><h3> #4: Loss of Coworker Morale</h3><p> <br/> Nobody wants to work in a revolving door. If the cubicle next to them seems to have a different body in it every few months or year, it can be hard for even your top performer to keep up the happy face. Employees begin to question why their company can&rsquo;t keep talented individuals, and the low morale only spreads when they&rsquo;re the ones stuck picking up the slack until you find a replacement. Imagine having to teach a new hire the same systems every few months just to have them leave. You can see the frustration that would build. Before long, you&rsquo;ll probably be paying the turnover costs of that top performer, too.</p><h3> #5: Drops in Employee Productivity</h3><p> <br/> Related to the low morale is lower engagement, which means lower productivity. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://good.co/blog/2013/11/13/workplace-happiness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Good.co  </a> </u> :</p><li> Engaged employees perform 20% better than their disengaged counterparts</li><li> Disengaged workers cost the U.S. $450-$550 billion a year in lost productivity <br/>  </li><p> Low morale doesn&rsquo;t just lead to more turnover; it can cost you boatloads of money even if that employee sticks around. And it doesn&rsquo;t even account for the cost of your employees being overworked in the wake of someone quitting.</p><h3> #6: Hits to Your Company Reputation</h3><p> <br/> Employees aren&rsquo;t the only ones who hurt from turnover; your customers may start to question your stability and reputation as a company if their point of contact within your organization changes monthly from Joe to Sue to Dave to Carla. Building a strong client or customer base is about building a relationship, and that relationship will be on shaky ground if they&rsquo;re always being introduced to a face of the company. Worse, important client needs can slip through the cracks while you&rsquo;re in limbo looking for a replacement. This kind of customer experience could have a ripple effect across potential customers and clients, especially if you build a reputation of not being able to retain talent, which would cause immeasurable potential profit loss over the long haul.</p><h3> #7: Customer Loss Via Employee Loyalty</h3><p> <br/> Maybe the employee who left your company was a star and built strong, lasting relationships with your clients. You run the risk of the clients abandoning you when that top performer leaves you too. Sure, you probably have rules in place about this, but it won&rsquo;t stop this from happening entirely.</p><h3> #8: Lost Organizational Knowledge</h3><p> <br/> It can take a while to become acclimated to a new company &mdash; and not just in terms of job training. A long-time employee knows that George is the contact person for IT issues and has formed a working relationship there. They know that PASSWORD2 is the default password for all internal applications. They know that Lucy leaves early on Thursdays to take her daughter to dance class, so all work should be handed in by then. This kind of &ldquo;insider&rdquo; company knowledge doesn&rsquo;t come quickly and isn&rsquo;t easy to teach. Fully infiltrating a new hire into your company requires patience and a lot of assistance from your existing staff. Meaning it costs dollars.</p><p> There are both clear and hidden costs of employee turnover, but all should make you boost the resources you put into employee retention. Because every dollar spent now could save hundreds further down the line.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-21 18:06:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-21 18:06:02.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_GbBbGEU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/these-8-reasons-will-have-you-hell-bent-on-employee-retention/\", \"post_id\": \"4875\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-21 18:06:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-21 18:06:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"these-8-reasons-will-have-you-hell-bent-on-employee-retention\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4874\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2187\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Most-least-expensive-cities-Money-falling-from-the-sky-jpg.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"769\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437565500,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2146,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Balance Business and Personal Goals","link":"how-to-balance-business-and-personal-goals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Do you run your own business and find it challenging to balance both your business and personal goals? Whether you have employees or work alone, finding that balance can often seem impossible.</p><p> You might feel like you&rsquo;re being pulled in ten different directions on any given day, or your to-do list might be suffocating you.</p><p> How can you go about creating more balance? It&rsquo;s not impossible, but it does take the right approach along with some prioritizing. Here&rsquo;s how you can go about managing both your business and personal goals.</p><h3> Make a List</h3><p> <br/> This sounds so simple, because it is! However, it can really help, especially if you have a million things floating around in your head and you can&rsquo;t seem to hold onto any of them.</p><p> Make time to write up a list without any distractions. Create two columns: one for your business goals, and another for your personal goals. Write down as many goals as you can think of, big or small. If you&rsquo;ve been extremely busy and haven&rsquo;t defined your goals in a while, leave room for any goals you might think of afterward. If you have to, sleep on it, and come back the next day.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re satisfied with your list, go back through and make each goal specific. Goals need to be  <u>  clear and measurable </u> , otherwise you can&rsquo;t tell if you&rsquo;re making progress toward them or not.</p><p> Maybe a business goal is to work less, but earn more. Get clearer on that &mdash; how many hours a day do you want to work? Do you only want to work four days out of the week? Do you need better paying clients? Figure out what hourly rate you need to earn to make that happen.</p><p> Your personal goals might include being able to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-much-do-i-need-to-invest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   save for retirement  </a> </u>  or your child&rsquo;s college expenses. Again, define that very clearly and specifically. How much of your income do you want to put toward these goals? This will also help you figure out what you need to be charging.</p><p> Making this list and  <u>  getting your goals on paper </u>  should provide you with a small sense of relief. Everything is out there in the open. Now it&rsquo;s time to prioritize.</p><h3> How to Prioritize Your Goals</h3><p> <br/> Prioritizing can be tough, especially when your business goals are competing with your personal goals. Both are probably equally important to you.</p><p> Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have unlimited time or resources. That&rsquo;s exactly why prioritizing is necessary. You can&rsquo;t run your business and your personal life without a system or purpose. Defining your goals will give you that purpose, and it&rsquo;s up to you to .</p><p> Go through your list and circle the goals you think will have the biggest impact. Completing these goals first will hopefully pave the way to succeeding with your other goals. Setting up the biggest systems first might be hard, but there&rsquo;s often a bigger payoff.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;re done, rearrange all your goals so they&rsquo;re ordered from most important to least important. You now know what you need to focus on first.</p><h3> Work Smarter, Not Harder</h3><p> <br/> Still overwhelmed with your list of goals? You need to start working smarter, not harder.</p><p> Carefully consider the value of your time, and what you&rsquo;re getting paid (or how profitable your business is). Are pesky tasks popping up that derail your plans for the day? Do you feel uninspired to work on your business? Do you need to create more structure?</p><p> If the answer is yes to any of those, consider hiring help and outsourcing if you can. For example, if you value your time at $100 per hour, but can delegate a task to someone and pay them $15 per hour, you&rsquo;re saving yourself a lot of time (and sanity!) &mdash; and not paying much for it.</p><p> Outsourcing means you can devote more time to tackling your goals and earning more. You can  <u>  focus on the big picture </u>  while others focus on the smaller pieces. If you were focusing too much on your business before, straightening these kinks out will give you more time to focus on your personal life. The same is true if the tables are turned (maybe you need to hire a babysitter for your kids).</p><p> If you already have a team, figure out what needs to be done to get your business (and your life) running more efficiently. Maybe you need to start delegating more, or maybe your team needs more direction. Ask for their input and work together to create a seamless system.</p><h3> Create a Plan of Action</h3><p> <br/> Now that you have a clear vision of what you want to accomplish in your business and personal life, you need to create a plan to succeed.</p><p> First, only focus on one or two goals to start. The overall goal is to make balancing your business and personal life easier, right? Trying to make everything happen all at once is a good way to throw off that balance.</p><p> You should have prioritized your goals before, but make sure the order in which you complete them gets you closer to finding balance. You shouldn&rsquo;t focus on 5  <u>  business goals </u>  in a row unless completing them all gives you much more time to focus on your personal goals. Try and alternate them.</p><p> Next, think about the steps you need to take to reach your goals. Breaking big goals into smaller ones will make this process less overwhelming. Don&rsquo;t make major changes overnight. Create a timeline for your goals, and plot the small steps you need to take to reach them. Remember to make your goals measurable so you can track your progress.</p><p> Consider keeping a journal of sorts to track how things are working out. Sometimes we&rsquo;re so busy making changes, we forget to take stock of how our situation is changing. Note when you experience differences in how your work and personal life feel.</p><p> Lastly,  <u>  things change </u> . Perhaps a goal that was once important to you has fallen to the bottom of the list now. It might not make sense to continue working on it. Set up one day out of the month to have a meeting with yourself and look over your original plan. Re-work it if necessary.</p><h3> Balance is Key</h3><p> <br/> Balance doesn&rsquo;t have to be something elusive we&rsquo;re all chasing after. By setting up the right systems and prioritizing your goals, you can enjoy the work you do and improve your personal situation. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be either/or.

People often approach life from the perspective that &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; happens to them. In reality each person is simply choosing not to take action, not to choose the destiny he or she desires in order to pass blame.</p><p> Let me explain: Imagine it&rsquo;s raining outside and you don&rsquo;t want to get wet. You have several options for staying dry. You can stay indoors, go outside and use an umbrella, or go outside wearing a raincoat. If you ignore these options&mdash;if you fail to take action to stay dry&mdash;and go outside and get wet anyway and then complain that you got wet &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s raining outside,&rdquo; in my mind you made the choice to get wet.</p><p> Complaining that you got wet because it&rsquo;s raining outside shows that you are unable to accept responsibility for what happens to you or for you.</p><p> Such things happen in the workplace all the time for both business leaders and employees: tasks that arise, decisions that must be made, etc. In each case, it is all about choosing to take action and accepting the results, good or bad, right or wrong. If they&rsquo;re good or right, that&rsquo;s wonderful. If they&rsquo;re bad or wrong, then make another choice to take action so you can achieve different results.</p><p> Ultimately, you have complete control over the outcomes in your life and how you get there. People often forget they have choices to achieve desired outcomes and instead leave issues to chance and then claim &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; happens to them. If you walk around thinking, &ldquo;I cannot control what others do,&rdquo; you are correct&mdash;you cannot. However, what you can do is choose to take action on those things you do control. If you want to be supported by like-minded individuals then choose to be around people who are about taking action to make things happen. If you don&rsquo;t like some of the people you hang with because they are about blame and not taking action, then choose to not be with them. For some relationships this can be a hard decision.

{"original_id":2144,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Key Behaviors Of Resilient People","link":"4-key-behaviors-of-resilient-people","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  At ten years of age, I rode my bike on a cow trail near our ranch house in Wyoming. I sped along at a good clip, too fast to notice a coiled rattlesnake on the other side of rock&mdash;until the snake struck out at full length. My bike flipped, and as I landed, I felt dozens of pricks all over my arms and hands. My mind raced with fear because I thought the rattlesnake had bitten me. </strong></p><p> We lived on a remote ranch in the mountains and it was a two-hour drive on dirt roads to a hospital.</p><p> At ten, I prepared myself to die of snake poisoning.</p><p> Right about the time I was mourning the loss of what could have been a spectacular life, I noticed that I had landed in a pile of cactus. The wreck of my bike told me the rest of the story&mdash;the snake had struck the spokes of the front wheel and was now struggling to get out of the broken and bent spoke wires. </p><p> <strong>  My first instinct was to run home to safety, but my parents had taught me that nothing can be accomplished by running, </strong>  so I found a good sized rock and made sure that particular rattlesnake would never terrorize my cow lane again.</p><p> Then I loaded the bike on my shoulders and carried the sorry mess home.</p><p> Our reaction to adversity plays a big role in determining how fast we get back on track with life. New research shows that resilience to adversity in our life may be linked to how often we face it. The number of blows a person has taken may affect their mental toughness more than any other factor.</p><p> The School Of Hard Knocks has been around for awhile. The early Christians learned this lesson when they were being thrown into dungeons by the Romans. The apostle Paul wrote the following in a letter: &ldquo;We also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character, and character, hope.&rdquo; ( <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A3-4&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Romans 5:3-4 </a> ).</p><p> Resilience is not only the ability to bend and bounce back from adversity, it is the strength to bounce though them as well. When I was an FBI agent, I realized that it is a person&rsquo;s level of resilience that determines who succeeds and who fails. </p><p> A person with a strong mind is someone who can predict the way they will respond to events in life so they can choose the better alternative. They can look back at how they&rsquo;ve responded to situations in the past, learn from those experiences, and apply that knowledge to future ones.</p><p> Living through adversity gives you the confidence that you can come out at the other end of almost anything. Here are 4 key behaviors of resilient people:</p><h3> Tip #1: Decide Who Is In Control</h3><p> <br/> My first reaction to the rattlesnake was a healthy dose of fear. At some point, however, I had a choice of letting that fear control me&mdash;or not. If it did, it meant I ran home and waited for my parents to take care of both the snake and my bike. If I didn&rsquo;t let fear control me, it meant I got myself out of the situation using my own resources.</p><p> Develop an understanding of your fear. Chances are good that your fear sprouts from feelings of insecurity or doubts you may have about yourself.</p><p> It takes courage to look inwardly into the darkest part of your personality. We all contain bits of light and dark; we all contain bits of gold and lead.</p><h3> Tip #2: Face Down Reality</h3><p> <br/> If you want to be resilient, you must be able to look the reality of your situation square in the face.</p><p> There is a big difference between optimists who believe that everything will work out OK in the end, and positive thinkers who do not let optimism distort their sense of reality. Positive thinkers hunt the good stuff and look for positives in the middle of adversity, but they do not expect their situation to change; instead, they find ways to prevail in the middle of hardship.</p><p> Resilient people have a very sober understanding of what it takes to survive. This requires the ability to anticipate the worst of outcomes while staying cool at the same time. </p><p> My FBI training prepared me to be resilient by showing me how to truly stare down reality. It prepared me to act in ways that allowed me to endure when I was thrown into unpredictable and unstable situations. I trained how to survive before the fact&mdash;that was the essence of the FBI&rsquo;s training program at the Academy.</p><h3> Tip #3: Find Meaning In Your Life</h3><p> <br/> If you look at yourself as a victim, living through a hardship carries no lesson for you. But, if you are resilient, you will squeeze meaning from your adversity and build a bridge to a better, and more fulfilled, future. </p><p> No one exemplified this better than  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl\" target=\"_blank\">   Victor Frankl  </a>  , </u> an Austrian psychiatrist and Auschwitz survivor. In his book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437343703&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=man%27s+search+for+meaning&amp;pebp=1437343706519&amp;perid=1N2YWBSJRBR4WS818GNP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Man&rsquo;s Search For Meaning  </a> </u> , Frankl describes the pivotal moment in the concentration camp when he became disgusted by how trivial and meaningless his life had become. He realized that to survive, he had to find a purpose. Frankl imagined himself giving a lecture after the war on the psychology of the concentration camp. </p><p> When he gave himself a concrete goal, he rose above his sufferings of the moment. He said, &ldquo;We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation.&rdquo;</p><p> Possessing strong values creates an environment of meaning because they offer ways to interpret events. The most successful people, and businesses, have a purpose beyond just making money.</p><h3> Tip #4: Make Do And Get On With It</h3><p> <br/> Life never deals a perfect hand. Perhaps it was never meant to&mdash;as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Meister-Eckhart-Mystic-Warrior-Our-Times-ebook/dp/B00L3KI2XI/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437343747&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=meister+eckhart&amp;pebp=1437343758597&amp;perid=1CWS6KHPY7W1Z20HSPJ5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meister Eckhart  </a> </u>  once said, &ldquo;If humankind could have known God without the world, God would never have created the world.&rdquo;</p><p> We learn, grow, and stretch by not just surviving adversity, but by thriving in the midst of it. When hardship does hit, resilience is the ability to make do with whatever we have available. Resilient people improvise and experiment until they find a solution to the problem. The key is to make improvising a way of life.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Unexpected-Resilient-Performance-Uncertainty/dp/0787996491/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Karl E. Weick  </a> </u> , a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Michigan believes there is good evidence that when people are put under pressure, they regress to their most habituated ways of responding.</p><p> Again, the way we train ourselves to think, feel, and behave during our regular daily life is exactly the way we will respond when hit with hard times. </p><p> What other key behaviors have you noticed in resilient people?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-21 17:33:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-21 17:33:48.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_iF7Bgn6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-key-behaviors-of-resilient-people/\", \"post_id\": \"4867\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-21 17:33:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-21 17:33:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-key-behaviors-of-resilient-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4866\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2183\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/resilient-tree-1940x900_36364.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1463\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437564600,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2143,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Make Tea, British Style","link":"how-to-make-tea-british-style","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We recently hosted our own  <u>  <a href=\"http://liagriffith.com/host-an-english-style-high-tea/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   English style High Tea  </a> </u>  here at our studio. Afternoon Tea is the perfect way to celebrate a Bridal shower, Baby Shower or just a great way to spend time with your girlfriends. Wanting to keep it simple and easy to achieve our High Tea menu consisted of light and delicious cucumber sandwiches, yummy salmon and dill sandwiches, deviled eggs using our own garlic aioli recipe and a selection of cute miniature sweets. Our High Tea menu was really easy to put together but when it came to the tea, we turned to our British writer and PR gal Emily to guide us through this ancient process! Here is Emily to teach us the proper way to make a British cup of tea:</p><p> According to tea connoisseurs Twinings, the taste of tea is greatly affected by the environment in which it is grown. From the soil it grows in to the climate surrounding it, tea leaves from the same family can have a totally different taste. For that reason always choose a good quality loose leaf tea grown by a company who supports fair trade. We are using Twinings Loose Leaf Traditional English for our High Tea. This is perfect with milk and maybe a little sugar to enhance the flavors for a truly British afternoon tea. Begin by filling your kettle with fresh cold water. Tea loves oxygen and if you keep re-boiling old water you will end up with a really flat cup of tea &ndash; yukky! Once the kettle has boiled, leave it for a minute or two. Boiling water will burn the tea, it scalds it and the tea doesn&rsquo;t release all of its maximum flavors so take the time to let it cool for just a moment. You don&rsquo;t need to pack lots of loose tea into your pot for a flavorful cup. The most important thing is for the leaves to have movement and freedom, so the typical rule is one teaspoon per person plus one for the pot. Allow the tea to brew for 3 minutes then it is ready to serve. There&rsquo;s an age old discussion in the UK around whether one should pour the milk into the cup first or the tea. In Victorian times the milk was poured in first to save the precious china from cracking as the hot tea goes in though it has become acceptable to pour the milk into the tea. If you do not want milk in your tea then a slice of lemon adds a refreshing touch, especially for summer. Black tea is bitter to taste so you may find you need something to sweeten it. If milk is not your thing add a little honey to sweeten it or add a little sugar if you&rsquo;d rather. Either way the sweetness will intensify the flavor of your tea. (Emily)</p><p> Thanks Emily! I just adored this slow, thoughtful process of making tea. And you know what, it worked, I truly believe we made the perfect cup of tea that day.

you have to be proactive and work for it.</p><p> Also, it&rsquo;s not just enough to be good at your job, you have to make it clear that you want a promotion and make yourself stand out in the office.</p><p> With that in mind, here are some tips on increasing your chances of landing a promotion.</p><h3> Make Your Interests Known</h3><p> <br/> A lot of the time, people are recommended for promotion, or the decision makers will have someone in mind for the position.</p><p> Speak to your boss about your desire to progress within the business, and make it clear that you&rsquo;re looking for a more senior position within the company.</p><p> This can pay off as &ndash; not only can your boss recommend you for any internal vacancies &ndash; but they can give you certain projects and tasks to work on that will boost your chances.</p><h3> Find Out What You Need To Do</h3><p> <br/> When you want a promotion, it&rsquo;s a good idea to discover exactly what you need to have achieved to be seriously considered by the decision makers.</p><p> Approach your boss about your career in general, and ask what sort of things you can be doing to maximise your chances of promotion.</p><p> This is also a good idea as it stops your boss feeling like you&rsquo;re going behind their back &ndash; it&rsquo;s vital to have as many people on your side as possible when it comes to progressing within an organisation.</p><h3> Befriend A Mentor</h3><p> <br/> One of the best ways of discovering how you can  <strong>  really </strong>  get a promotion is by talking to someone who has gotten one themselves.</p><p> Take the time to get to know a colleague in your department who has recently been promoted and try and pick their brains on how they went about it, what the process was and what you can do to achieve something similar.</p><p> This will give you a much more honest and realistic insight into what steps you can take to maximise your chances of getting a promotion than your boss or HR might give you, as they&rsquo;re normally bound by certain company policies and restrictions.</p><h3> Do Your Own Job Well</h3><p> <br/> While it might be tempting to forgo your usual day-to-day tasks and responsibilities to prove that you would be able to perform at a more senior level, this can backfire if your boss notices that you&rsquo;ve been slacking on your &ldquo;normal&rdquo; job requirements.</p><p> Make sure you put your all into every task you complete as you would normally do, as this is the one of the key ways you&rsquo;ll be taken seriously by decision makers.</p><p> When deciding whether to offer you a promotion or not, senior staff will look at your current work ethic, as well as your ability to perform at a higher level so there isn&rsquo;t really any room for error.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-20 21:43:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-20 21:43:33.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_ANuUCFa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-increase-your-chances-of-promotion-at-work/\", \"post_id\": \"4861\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-20 21:43:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-20 21:43:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-increase-your-chances-of-promotion-at-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4860\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2180\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/115039371.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"769\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437506100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2141,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Founder Due Diligence -- the Business Model","link":"founder-due-diligence-the-business-model","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Simply put, the business model describes how the company intends to make money and become sustainably profitable. It could also be said that the business model describes how the company will develop and deliver value to its customers, employees, and investors.</p><p> Eventually, the full description of the business model will reside in the various elements of the business plan. The business model need not be fully expanded or given a label during the formative period of the company; however, the founders need to have an understanding of how their particular technology and products are going to be developed and sold into their selected markets.</p><h3> Value Proposition</h3><p> <br/> For instance, founders should have a sense of how they think their company and its products will compete; for instance, the company can provide value and compete on the basis of providing products and services that are in one of the following  value-proposition categories :</p><li> <strong>  Lowest price (with acceptable customer benefits) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Highest performance (with highest price) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Greatest value (based on a combination of benefits) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Newest technology (performance advantages) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Most attractive design (colors and appearance) </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Market Segments</h3><p> <br/> Deciding on which value proposition to offer points the company to certain characteristics of the  market segments  to be chosen; for instance, the value proposition offered by the categories above would be correlated to, and expected to have, customers who are:</p><li> <strong>  Price-conscious commodity buyers </strong></li><li> <strong>  Leading-edge and affluent buyers </strong></li><li> <strong>  Middle-income buyers </strong></li><li> <strong>  Buyers of any age who can be influenced by technology </strong></li><li> <strong>  Buyers of any age, perhaps, but certainly kids and children </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Organizational Emphasis</h3><p> <br/> These value propositions and customer targets lead the company to consider related issues as to how the company is organized to provide products and make a profit; for instance, for the categories outlined above (and matched to the value propositions stated earlier),  organizational emphasis  may be based on:</p><li> <strong>  Focus on low-cost manufacturing, sourcing, and advertising, with technology least important </strong></li><li> <strong>  Increased R&amp;D, engineering, and manufacturing costs, with advertising in high-end status magazines and on TV, etc. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Balanced organizational details related to technology, design, manufacturing, marketing, and sales, all efficiently organized </strong></li><li> <strong>  Leading-edge technology, heavily protected with IP, appealing to both younger and more affluent customers </strong></li><li> <strong>  Emphasis on superior design and marketing to younger customers </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Competitive Landscape</h3><p> <br/> Competitors exist in any market targeted by the new venture. By studying competitor models, entrepreneurs can gain an appreciation of how organizational details are deployed by other companies to enable them to create revenue, profit, and satisfied customers. While more in-depth competitor analysis occurs later as the company develops, founders need to understand within the time and resource constraints of the formative stage the competitive landscape.</p><p> The analysis of the competitive landscape, along with the SWOT analysis, prepares the founders to define the business model and identify the major elements of the strategic plan, starting with a delineation of the envisioned company&rsquo;s unique competitive advantage (UCA) that the founders believe will enable their new venture to become successful (e.g., outperform their competitors). A UCA is simply that unique advantage the new venture has in comparison to competitors in the market. Of course, the UCA, along with other strategic actions that may be created, can only be anticipated during the early stages of the new venture; however, a proper business model and strategic plan enable the founders to develop a convincing message that will be read and heard by investors in the near future.</p><h3> Sustainability</h3><p> <br/> Once the UCA is identified, it is a valuable exercise to consider the other organizational functions of the business and how they will be designed and implemented to support a  sustainable  UCA. A sustainable UCA, as it implies, provides a rational basis for presuming the new venture can become a lasting and valuable company.</p><p> Sustainability, as it applies to a business and it&rsquo;s UCA, involves supporting strategies and plans for the functional departments consisting of:</p><li> <strong>  Technology (and R&amp;D) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Engineering </strong></li><li> <strong>  Manufacturing </strong></li><li> <strong>  Marketing </strong></li><li> <strong>  Sales (and Distribution) </strong> <br/>  </li><p> The details needed for functional departments are determined as a part of the planning that goes into developing the marketing plan, financial plan, and business plan. For founder due diligence, it is necessary to become aware of the future needs for planning.</p><h3> Concluding Remark</h3><p> <br/> The goal of founder due diligence, as mentioned in various ways before and in earlier articles, is for founders to assure themselves that they have discovered all the important issues (and hopefully none of them are showstoppers), resolve them to their satisfaction, and develop the well-founded confidence to proceed to next step of forming the corporation.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-20 21:34:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-20 21:34:53.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_8p0NTS6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/founder-due-diligence-the-business-model/\", \"post_id\": \"4859\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-20 21:34:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-20 21:34:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"founder-due-diligence-the-business-model\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4858\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2179\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437419764061-2473afe69fc2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1402\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437498000,"author_id":408,"chart_url":""}

ROI is simple $&rsquo;s and cents. ROR is the value (both perceived and real) that will accrue over time through connection, loyalty, recommendations and sharing&hellip; and is used to define and educate companies, brands, and people about the importance of creating authentic connection, interaction, and engagement.</p><p> In this follow-up post, I would like to discuss how to avoid a crash-and-burn scenario that&rsquo;s difficult to climb back from; here are four relationship killers to avoid:</p><h3> Ignoring your critics </h3><p> <br/> Have you heard the dentist&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;Ignore your teeth and they&rsquo;ll go away?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s so true and such a great illustration of how ignoring some problems just makes them worse. When someone posts a critique of your business online and you ignore it, the critic doesn&rsquo;t go away, but your brand reputation can be seriously eroded. Ignoring any response to your posts on social is a sign that you don&rsquo;t really care, or that you&rsquo;re trying to brush something under the rug. Your policy should be to always respond in a timely manner, even if it&rsquo;s just to thank the person for their insight. Remember, not everyone who views your brand&rsquo;s channel will take part in the conversation. Many just want to see what&rsquo;s going on, how responsive you are, and they&rsquo;re making decisions about you based on what they see.</p><h3> Socially disengaged C-Suite</h3><p> <br/> Social media communication has changed people&rsquo;s expectations of brands. People who use social channels want the brands they deal with to communicate with them on those channels. And they&rsquo;re not just looking for deals and coupons. They&rsquo;re looking for insight from the top executives, and they don&rsquo;t want to have to wade through an annual report to get it. They want to know about you as a human being&mdash;not a logo.</p><p> These broadened expectations mean that it&rsquo;s unwise to distance yourself from the social public. Social media gives you two huge opportunities you never had before&mdash;to listen directly to your audience for gaining insights, and to share your wisdom as a thought leader and a fellow human being. Executives who step out from behind their brand and are active on social channels (at least one) build more trust and credibility for their brand and also inspire their employees to do the same.</p><p> In fact, marketing and sales strategist David Meerman Scott noted in a  <u>  recent article </u>  that socially active CEOs like Richard Branson, Martha Stewart and Arianna Huffington are prime examples of the benefits of social leadership in action, and how important it is to the forward momentum of their companies.</p><p> &ldquo;The social connection helps these CEOs show the entire organization that real-time engagement is an important driver of business. &ldquo;If the CEO can do it, so can you&rdquo; is the unwritten message to employees. But when a CEO is not engaged at all (which describes the vast majority of company leaders, I&rsquo;m afraid) the opposite is true. Employees are reluctant to use social tools to connect with customers.&rdquo;</p><p> David is absolutely right about the importance of leading by example and empowering your employees to use today&rsquo;s tools to build stronger relationships. Unfortunately the disengaged executive also leads by example&mdash;and holds their company back in its ability to scale social relationships that drive business.</p><h3> Trying to be cute rather than authentic</h3><p> <br/> Time and time again we see examples of companies that post things in the interest of being funny or riding a popular trend that totally disconnects with their followers and causes a backlash. Your brand&rsquo;s social messaging strategy should be carefully thought out and align with your values, goals and objectives, so your posts will &ldquo;ring true&rdquo; with your audience. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to be boring or stuffy&mdash;but those who are posting for you should have a deep understanding of your company&rsquo;s audience as well as your values and mission, and use that lens for creating posts. Thinking before your speak is just as important on social channels as it is in face-to-face situations, and failure to do so is responsible for many damaged relationships.</p><h3> Not walking the talk</h3><p> <br/> Another thing that contributes to lost relationships is not delivering on your promises. When companies say they have certain standards and then don&rsquo;t live up to them, whether the interaction is face-to-face or online, how can they expect loyalty from customers? It&rsquo;s all about the experience, and everyone who deals with your company needs to know that they&rsquo;ll receive a consistently great experience from you regardless of the channel of communication.</p><p> The speed of social word of mouth makes it imperative that your business practices are in line with your published values and mission&mdash;so make sure all employees know what&rsquo;s expected and give them the tools to over-deliver to customers, vendors, partners and each other.</p><p> Using social media to nurture relationships effectively isn&rsquo;t rocket science&mdash;it&rsquo;s common sense. However, it still surprises me how many brands are still making the same mistakes and resist using social channels to do what all great relationship builders have in common: being good to people. #BeGoodToPeople #JustBeNice</p><p> Yes, technology is changing in ways we never imagined, but basic human-to-human communication has not. Find ways to use new social tools to be good to people, and you can avoid relationship killers altogether.</p><p> <strong>  Relationships are like muscle tissue&hellip; the more they are engaged, the stronger and more valuable they become. #RonR #NoLetUp </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-20 21:29:29.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-20 21:29:29.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_l2kur3c.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/social-roi-dont-make-these-mistakes-and-lose-return-on-relationship-via-sproutsocial/\", \"post_id\": \"4857\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-20 21:29:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-20 21:29:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"social-roi-dont-make-these-mistakes-and-lose-return-on-relationship-via-sproutsocial\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4856\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2178\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2014-12-26-at-8.19.01-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"490\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437501600,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2139,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Disrupt or Die? Three Marketing Lessons for Financial Services from the Tech Sector","link":"disrupt-or-die-three-marketing-lessons-for-financial-services-from-the-tech-sector","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlueChip_Comm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Carden Calder  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   BlueChip Communications  </u> </a>  </p><p> Disrupt or die? Which side of the digital tsunami is your brand or employer on? It may not be a straight yes/no answer. But if you&rsquo;re not surfing the wave(s) you&rsquo;re facing a real risk of wipe-out. Literally.</p><p> Why? Evidence, analysis and data all suggest it&rsquo;s soon to &ldquo;disrupt or be disrupted&rdquo;.</p><p> So what should CMOs and CEOs in financial services do when faced with the wave?</p><p> Learn from those who created it, and stay on there right side of it.</p><p> The top three marketing strategies used by disruptors that we see as more mature players:</p><p> <strong>  1. Influencer marketing (think ANZ&rsquo;s current &lsquo;Your world, your way&rsquo;)  <br/>  2. Social CRM (it&rsquo;s smart but creepy that my bank tweets back at me now)  <br/>  3. Challenger brand strategy (RaboDirect beats up the big banks) </strong> <br/>  </p><p> Whether you think social is a no brainer or high risk/low return channel (yes, plenty of people in our industry think the latter) the evidence is now overwhelming.. What&rsquo;s more interesting than the business case is &ldquo;how&rdquo; mature businesses are mimicking.</p><p> The latest KPMG report titled Unlocking the potential: The fintech opportunity for Sydney, reminds us tomorrow&rsquo;s customer will be more demanding, less loyal to their financial institution and characterised by a desire for immediate, transparent and personalised service. That kind of service will be powered by technology and social media marketing.</p><p> <strong>  1. Influencer marketing: </strong>  Just as Uber launched at SxSW &hellip; so too are banks and FS businesses going after influencers. Not so new, not so novel but all &ldquo;shiny object&rdquo; powered by social media networks and specifically the power of influencer networks. Take Jeff Bullas, Kim Kardashian or Warren Buffet. We know a tweet from Kim is worth $15K to a sponsor. What&rsquo;s the value of 250,000 new signs ups in a week to you? Someone with the power to deliver it to you can probably tell you what it&rsquo;s worth to them. They charge you. Call it blogger relations at its most basic, thought leadership marketing in a traditional asset management sense or experimental marketing to consumer opinion leaders, effective influencer marketing can create great visibility for your product or service as long as you&rsquo;re also great at service delivery.</p><p> Here in Australia Uber conducted a slightly different influencer campaign, not with an influencer but with kittens. Uber launched #UberKittens where customers could order a kitten car and for $40 a kitten (along with a handler) would come and play with you for 15 minutes. The internet loves cats and who wouldn&rsquo;t want to share a selfie with a kitten? This campaign shows Uber&rsquo;s ability to use popular culture to generate social buzz and engage with what their customers are talking about.</p><br/> <p> Taking a look at financial services, ANZ&rsquo;s recent &lsquo;Your world, your way&rsquo; campaign &ndash; aimed to empower and to encourage people to follow their dreams. You too can be as cool as the founder of ATARI Nolan Bushmell, or as adventurous and determined as sailor Jessica Watson. Different to Uber&rsquo;s direct approach, the ANZ influencer campaign uses opinion leaders or well-known people to tell us anything is achievable &ndash; our way.</p><p> <strong>  2. Social CRM: </strong>  customer relationships management, as cited in Temenos&rsquo; &lsquo;Lessons learned from Banking industry disruptors&rsquo; report, is using social media and big data to help firms to get a clearer picture of their customers&rsquo; lives. In doing so, it allowed them to determine customers&rsquo; creditworthiness &ndash; leading to better pricing and well informed online relationship management (also known as social CRM). Through CRM companies are able to better understand their customers and in turn hyper-personalise the user experience.</p><p> German bank, Fidor Bank, has embraced social media and interaction throughout its business model. Using social media Fidor Bank not only speak with customers but also consult with customers when developing new products and provide a space for peer-to-peer online forums. Last but not least, Fidor Bank pays increased interest on certain accounts for customers who are fans of the bank on Facebook. That&rsquo;s a good incentive if I&rsquo;ve ever heard one!</p><p> National Australia Bank (NAB) also saw the need to embrace social and in 2012 opened its &lsquo;social media command centre&rsquo;. The team of seven &ndash; drawn from the bank&rsquo;s marketing, digital and corporate affairs divisions &ndash; was tasked with managing the 5000+ social media interactions per month. NAB&rsquo;s seven day a week service enabled its social media community to grow by more than 350% in 2012, with content reaching over 12 million users. NAB&rsquo;s early adaption to social CRM has allowed it to outperform its competitors and gain greater insights into their behaviour patterns, wants and needs. How often do you tweet your bank?</p><br/> <p> <strong>  3. Challenger brand strategy &ndash; disrupting the disruptors: </strong>  Challenger brand marketing is just as it sounds. Non-dominant brands overturning and undermining the status-quo through innovative marketing that connects with the customer.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a step back to 2011 when RaboDirect launched their attack on the big four banks. What were the big 4 doing? According to RaboDirect they were stealing people&rsquo;s dreams through low interest saving accounts. RaboDirect represented the big four as enjoying your holiday, buying your diamond ring and even buying your daughter&rsquo;s pony. Comical, and without directly shaming another, the campaign called for customers to act in a bid to steal back their dreams from the bank.</p><br/> <p> Like RaboDirect&rsquo;s &lsquo;stealing your dreams&rsquo; campaign, the Commonwealth Bank&rsquo;s (CBA) &lsquo;CAN&rsquo; campaign aimed to show customers what they were missing.

{"original_id":2137,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Pavlov's Brokers","link":"pavlovs-brokers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Nobel Prize winning physiologist Ivan Pavlov is best remembered for his work on what psychologists call &ldquo;classical conditioning&rdquo;.</p><h3> Classical conditioning refers to a learning process connecting a specific stimulus to a specific response.</h3><p> <br/> While any number of responses to stimuli are innate (jumping in response to a loud noise, for example), Pavlov demonstrated that responses can also be learned, or conditioned.</p><p> Pavlov&rsquo;s discoveries about classical conditioning centered on his experiments with dogs. During his work exploring the canine digestive system, Pavlov learned that dogs salivate when presented with food, a reflex that aids their digestion. Observing the animals in his lab, he noticed that the dogs also drooled when they saw a worker in a white lab coat. Ultimately, he realized that, because the dogs were fed by workers in white lab coats, they had come to associate white lab coats with food and they salivated in response. Interested to see whether he could induce the same reflex with another stimulus, Pavlov began ringing a bell before presenting dogs with food. Within a relatively short period of time, the dogs associated the ringing of the bell with the stimulus of food and began to salivate at the mere sound of the bell, even when Pavlov did not present the food. In this fashion, Pavlov produced a learned &ndash; or conditioned &ndash; connection between an environmental event previously unconnected to a reflex (the bell) and a reflex (salivation).</p><p> Pavlov&rsquo;s work was instrumental to our early understanding of learning. Conditioning drives a great deal of behavior, a fact well known both on Madison Avenue and Wall Street. Commercial advertising, for example, is designed to train the recipient to connect positive feelings with a product. Think of a massive Clydesdale and an adventurous little Golden Retriever puppy striking up an unlikely friendship and what product pops into your head along with a warm &ldquo;Awww, cute&rdquo; feeling? Budwiser: The King of Beers. Classical conditioning at its finest.</p><p> On Wall Street, classical conditioning is evident in its advertising for sure, but equally in the conditioning of trader and broker behavior.</p><p> Commission-based compensation systems are the foundation: a simple reward system in which you sell and you make money. There&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with these systems. It is important to understand what overlays them, though: the intentional fostering of a competitive, emotional environment for sales. A bell rings at the opening of the New York Stock Exchange and the competitive frenzy begins. &ldquo;Ringing the bell&rdquo; is a euphemism for making a sale because some brokerage firms literally used to ring a brass bell every time they made a sale, enhancing the already powerful impact of earning sales commissions with powerful emotional feedback from public approbation and victory over one&rsquo;s peers.</p><p> The fostering of these strong emotional responses to sales can be so intense in the financial services world that they can even overtake the importance of commissions. I&rsquo;ve known brokers who have made so much money that even they acknowledge they don&rsquo;t need more &ndash; but they stay in the game because they are addicted to the sound of the bell or the sight of their names at the top of a league table.</p><p> Where does this emotional conditioning of brokers leave the best interests of the investor? Somewhere apart from the stimulus/response link at least. Wall Street knows that much about its bell-ringing commission culture should be changed, but as a senior executive once told me, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to get the commission needle out of our arm.  It just makes us too much money and feels too good.&rdquo;</p><p> The stimulus that made me start writing this post was a recent report by the Ontario Securities Commission (&ldquo;OSC&rdquo;) about the adverse effects of commission-based broker compensation systems on mutual fund investment performance.</p><p> Acting on behalf of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the OSC commissioned The Brondesbury Group (&ldquo;TBG&rdquo;) to review existing research on mutual fund compensation. While I won&rsquo;t go into it in detail here, addicted as I am to good data, TBG&rsquo;s research is impressive. Their disclosures are comprehensive (they discuss their own potential biases), they offer both sides of the argument, and they back up their findings with solid academic research.</p><h3> Here are some of their conclusions: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Funds that pay commissions to brokers underperform compared to funds that do not have these expenses. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Funds sold in the broker channel (defined as commission-based) underperform direct channel funds (no commission) even before deducting any distribution-related expenses. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Research studies repeatedly find that commissions (load, 12b-1, etc.) and expenses are key drivers of relative fund performance.  Quite simply, any payment that raises costs tends to lower return on investment. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Funds paying more to brokers realize lower returns than comparable funds that pay less. </strong></li><li> <strong>  It is incontrovertible that compensation affects fund flows.  The literature on compensation and fund flow provides sufficient evidence to conclude that embedded commissions influence broker advice and, at times, that advice serves the interest of the broker and the product provider rather than the client. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> At the bottom of this post I have listed links to some of the research that TBG used in reaching their conclusions.  Many of the titles tell stories unto themselves.</p><p> The existence of commission-based systems alone could be the source of the TBG findings, but I think conditioning in the industry is at least as much if not more of the issue. There&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with the idea of products sold on commission, just as there&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with the idea of commission-based compensation systems.</p><p> As BTG&rsquo;s research shows, however, these products and systems aren&rsquo;t necessarily producing the best outcomes for investors and the intensity of the competitive environment in which they are being sold surely plays a role.</p><p> So when you hear the next exciting investment pitch, remember that the things that your broker is excited about may have a lot more to do with Pavlov, and the ringing of the commission bell, than with your portfolio returns or peace of mind.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-20 21:14:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-20 21:14:22.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_CJsIWVO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/pavlovs-brokers/\", \"post_id\": \"4851\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-20 21:14:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-20 21:14:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"pavlovs-brokers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4850\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2175\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2014050521383656.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1450\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437480000,"author_id":389,"chart_url":""}

It is a necessary component for the advisor &ndash; client relationship to work. In my work conducting  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/client-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   client advisory boards  </a> </u> , it comes up all the time in response to the question &ldquo;what do you most value about what your advisor does for you?&rdquo; Most advisors offer it as one of the prime reasons a client should choose them.</p><p> And here&rsquo;s the problem: you cannot deliver it.</p><p> Trust is not something that can be packaged and shipped. It cannot be documented in a report. It cannot be measured. It cannot be communicated through PowerPoint or statistics. An advisor is powerless to give it to anyone. Quite the opposite &ndash; the client must give it to the advisor.</p><p> And for this reason, claiming trust is utterly useless as a marketing tool.</p><p> It must grow and develop organically in the heart and mind of the client. It is a byproduct of behaviors.</p><p> An advisor can nurture a relationship and provide the environment for trust to blossom like a farmer tends his field. The farmer cannot &ldquo;produce&rdquo; crops. The seeds and plants are not under his control. He can alter the composition of the soil, provide the right amount of supplementation to the natural rainfall, can take care that he sprays the field with fertilizer and not Clorox. And if all the right activities are performed on the right schedule in the right amount the farmer will be able to harvest a crop.</p><p> Another reason trust will not help you gain clients is that all advisors claim it. And virtually all clients give it to their advisor. Both sides have to. Without trust, a working relationship between advisor and client cannot exist. In fact, working too hard to prove trustworthiness can backfire. Michael Kitces wrote  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/why-saying-youre-a-fiduciary-destroys-trust-instead-of-building-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   an interesting piece  </a> </u>  on how over-stressing the fiduciary standard, essentially attempting to claim trust by proxy (and bad mouthing the competition in the process) can actually erode trust.</p><p> Yet the idea of trust is still critically important. Since we cannot deliver trust, the next best thing is to show prospects (and clients) and do things that communicate your trustworthiness to them. Simply promising it won&rsquo;t work. But there are things you can do that can serve as a way of demonstrating that they can trust you.</p><p> <strong>  Show people what they can expect </strong>  &ndash; I am a big fan of having a &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   process graphic  </a> </u> &rdquo; as part of a new client presentation. It is an illustration of the steps you take clients through and the events that will happen at the beginning of a relationship.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.actifi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ActiFi  </a> </u>  talks about illustrating the first year in the life of a client. Ideally, this map would include some specific references to what makes your service unique. Letting people know what to expect (and then delivering on it) can help give people confidence that they will be treated well and will help build trust.</p><p> <strong>  Talk to people not down to people </strong>  &ndash; You know a lot more about planning and managing finances than your client does. However, some advisors and up slipping into a mode of speech that makes them sound arrogant or condescending. I had a conversation yesterday with a reporter from USNews who has covered the financial beat for over 30 years. One of her greatest frustrations, she said, was talking with advisors who felt they needed to &ldquo;educate&rdquo; her. If that is something you tell people you do, you may want to reconsider. I don&rsquo;t go to my doctor or my lawyer to be educated &ndash; I go to them for advice. Feeling talked down to is likely one of the significant reasons why 70% of widows find an advisor other than the one that worked with her late husband.</p><p> <strong>  Listen </strong>  &ndash; Being in the advice business, it can be easy to focus more on telling than hearing. That is a mistake, and erodes trust.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fa-mag.com/news/best-selling-author-pink-explains-how-to-get-clients-to-act-on-your-advice-22040.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Speaking at the HighTower Apex conference in Chicago  </a> </u>  last month, best selling author Daniel Pink said &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t force someone to be your client&hellip; You need to see (issues) from their point of view. You want to understand someone&rsquo;s interest, what&rsquo;s in it for them. Focus on listening and responding, and you build the attunement muscles. Many people do not listen well because it is not something widely taught. Develop the skill and you will be better connected to people.</p><p> <strong>  Keep your word  </strong> &ndash; If you say you are sending something in the mail, get it out immediately. If you promise to call someone back, especially if it is within a specific timeframe, make sure you call. One of the primary reasons clients leave an advisor is because of poor service. If you are not fulfilling your promises at the outset, you are communicating that people cannot count on you. The corollary to this is don&rsquo;t overpromise. One of my clients had a habit of being overly optimistic at how fast he could deliver on promises. He regularly made his office staff crazy with the mad scramble to get things done on time. Calling the client to ask if he could have an additional day or two was not unusual. I recommended that he simply add 50% onto the amount of time he thought it would take to do anything. If you can deliver ahead of schedule, so much the better. If something pops up, you have a little extra time to fulfill your promise.</p><p> <strong>  Be consistent </strong>  &ndash; Have processes so that activities happen the same way on the same basic schedule predictably. Do you send agendas in advance of meetings? Then ideally they would follow the same format and show up the same length of time before each appointment. Return phone calls within a work day of receiving the message. Getting a call back a couple hours after one message and a week after another is unsettling. Even if the call back is to let the client know you are still waiting for information, the predictability of hearing from you or someone on your staff reinforces trust. Have values and standards and stick to them, especially when the next bear market comes. Similar circumstances should lead to similar recommendations. President Reagan was trusted even by many people who disagreed with him because he was clear about his values and consistent in his decision-making.</p><p> <strong>  Ask for feedback </strong>  &ndash; In addition to learning interesting things about what your clients value most, asking for feedback communicates to clients your commitment to them. It is a way of elevating them in the relationship. When you express a genuine interest in providing them what they want out of the relationship the way that they want it, clients are reinforced in feeling that you have their best interests at heart. Clients are vulnerable; after all, you probably have discretion over a lot of their life savings. Being vulnerable in return deepens the relationship.</p><p> <strong>  Apologize </strong>  &ndash; We all make mistakes and have misunderstandings. When you discover one, or when a client points one out to you, take responsibility for it. Express remorse. Let them know you feel bad when you let them down.</p><p> While you cannot produce or deliver trust, you can nurture its development.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-20 21:08:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-20 21:08:58.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_llg5vq4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-conundrum-of-marketing-trust/\", \"post_id\": \"4847\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-20 21:08:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-20 21:08:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-conundrum-of-marketing-trust\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4846\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2173\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437403329523-c516c84a91c4-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"391\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437475500,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}

OK! But before you cash out, you&rsquo;ll need to find potential buyers. Middle market companies should generally be marketed to two broad groups of potential buyers: financial buyers and strategic buyers.</p><h3> Know your targets</h3><p> <br/> Financial buyers tend to be professional investors that don&rsquo;t have deep operational experience. These buyers, mostly private equity firms, family offices, and the like, tend to seek companies that have existing management teams that will stay with the company after a transaction and continue to operate as a stand alone company. Many can and will add industry experts to the company in management or board positions, but generally, they don&rsquo;t want to run the company on a day to basis.</p><p> Alternatively, strategic buyers are existing companies (either public or private) that are looking to add capabilities or competencies that your company can bring to them. Larger strategic buyers are more likely to roll your company up into their operations to take advantage of synergies.</p><h3> Market broadly</h3><p> <br/> Some advisors will argue that you should limit marketing to a small group of targets. I have generally not taken this approach. I find that it is best to be as broad as possible with targeting, as I have had very good transactional opportunities arise from very unlikely buyers. While there can be risks to every marketing effort, the value of finding the right buyer usually far outweighs the risks associated with marketing to a large group of targets.</p><p> It is difficult to tell in advance who the right buyer will be. While historically, strategic buyers have had a reputation of being able to pay more than financial buyers for companies, the &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer largely depends on your goals.</p><h3> Begin the process</h3><p> <br/> Contacting potential acquirers is usually handled in steps. First, your advisor will contact targets in a broad, anonymous effort, whetting their appetites without identifying your company. Then, the advisor will vet buyers, ensuring that they are serious. At this stage, your advisor should be entering into non-disclosure agreements with targets prior to providing them with any identifying information about your company.</p><p> Marketing your company will take one to three months (or more) from the time you bring an advisor on board. This depends on the speed at which you are able to provide him with the information he needs to put together the marketing package and the breadth of potential targets.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-20 21:03:36.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-20 21:03:36.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Q5mC8MC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-find-a-buyer-for-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"4845\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-20 21:03:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-20 21:03:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-find-a-buyer-for-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4844\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2172\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437317520234-9e37d10c5bb8-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"653\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437481800,"author_id":345,"chart_url":""}

But for adults who are almost or are in their early 40&rsquo;s, a career change may be a bit more challenging. There are many things to be considered, such as age discrimination, financial resources, the need for further education, and even their source of motivation. If you&rsquo;re in your 40&rsquo;s and you feel like a career change is necessary, here are some important tips that can help you succeed in this exciting endeavor:</p><h3> Take an inventory of your current skills.</h3><p> <br/> The very first thing you need to know is what skills you have, and which among those skills you enjoy and which ones you did not enjoy. Take into consideration your hobbies, past work history, and even your volunteer experiences. This step is very important because it will help you evaluate your qualifications for the next career path you wish to pursue.</p><h3> Get as many career ideas as possible.</h3><p> <br/> Check out the classified ads to see what opportunities are there you may explore. There are many local businesses also that you may want to work at, or even own, so you&rsquo;ve got to take note of all of them, and include them in your list of potential careers you need to further research.</p><h3> Go for a career that you can enjoy, and not one that can only make you earn money.</h3><p> <br/> Even at the age of 40, you still need to learn new things should you decide to pursue a new career pathway. With that said, it is very important that you have enough enthusiasm and passion to be able to enjoy learning new things. Also, the more you enjoy your chosen field of work, the more time you will be willing to spend at it. This gives you a bigger opportunity to increase your earning potential in the long run.</p><h3> Once you&rsquo;ve researched the careers you&rsquo;re interested in, narrow down your career choices.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not enough that you identify the careers you think are interesting; you&rsquo;ve got to do enough research about those career options to know which ones will suit you best. You may visit your local library, or even do an online search to gain as much information as you can about the careers you are considering. Your goal is to narrow your choices to around three careers, which you should get to know on a much deeper level.</p><h3> Have a clear picture in your mind of what career you really want to pursue.</h3><p> <br/> At this stage in your life, you&rsquo;ve got to have a sense of certainty when it comes to the kind of career you will have. You cannot be complacent all the time that you can change careers over and over again regardless of your age. You&rsquo;ve got to be very specific and you need to know the details very well.

It makes us not feel good about ourselves.  We get embarrassed.  Or self-righteous.  Or just weird.  When we know we&rsquo;ve said or done something that is not representative of who we are, we prefer to pretend it just didn&rsquo;t happen.</p><p> Memories are funny &ndash; we tend to safely pack away the times we&rsquo;ve shape-shifted ourselves into demon-like-creatures, spewing toxic slime throughout the workplace or all over the people we love.  Once we&rsquo;ve justified our actions (&ldquo;I was angry.&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Well&hellip;he shouldn&rsquo;t have&hellip;.&rdquo;  or &ldquo;If they&rsquo;d just do what I told them to do then&hellip;&rdquo;) we move on.   So should everyone else, right?</p><p> But it doesn&rsquo;t really work like that. People remember.</p><h3> We don&rsquo;t like to deal with the mess of our mistakes. We want to move on, but people remember.</h3><p> <br/> As I write this, I can think of many times I&rsquo;ve reacted that have left me feeling less than proud.  I remember one night last December (believe me, I don&rsquo;t have to reach that far back, this is just a better story than some of my more recent ones&hellip;) when my kiddo kept getting up in the middle of the night asking me for something.  It was the night before I was leading OnStage Leadership, so I had my alarm set for 4:30am the next morning.  I had dutifully put myself to bed at 9:30 that night so I&rsquo;d be rested and ready to go, but around 11pm I hear, &ldquo;Mommy&hellip;can I have a glass of water?&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Sure, Honey&rdquo; I said, dragging myself from my slumber.</p><p> Then around 1am&hellip;&rdquo;Maaaaahhhhhm!   I can&rsquo;t sleep!&rdquo;  Grrrrrrr.  I am now mad at both my husband for traveling  and  at my son, the sleeepless-wonder.  I walk to his room and sternly say, &ldquo;Jeremy, I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re having trouble sleeping.  Have you tried counting sheep?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;That never works.  Will you sing to me?&rdquo;</p><p> I remember so many times when I&rsquo;ve laid down beside my child and have sung him to sleep thinking,  what a miracle this is  &ndash;  I am so lucky to be here doing this &ndash; I have to tell you, I was not thinking those lovely things at that moment.</p><p> &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; I whisper in frustration, &ldquo;but only if you  promise  you&rsquo;ll go to sleep and  stay  asleep.&rdquo;</p><p> Then at 3am I feel a tap, tap, tap on my shoulder&hellip;.&rdquo;Mom, can I sleep with you?  I still can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;  I pretend he&rsquo;s not there as he crawls in next to me.  And he wiggles around.  And kicks off the covers.  And elbows me.  And finally&hellip;</p><p> &ldquo;Out!! OUT!!!&rdquo;  I scream.  &ldquo;Mommy has to get up in an hour and a half and I MUST SLEEP!!!!&rdquo;  I usher him into his own room, like some possessed alien.  &ldquo;STAY IN BED AND BE QUIET!&rdquo;</p><p> And then, at 3:15am as I lay there in the dark, feeling my heart pounding in my chest, it hit me.  The yuck.  The awareness that even though I was so tired and had what felt like an immense responsibility on my shoulders, I had just totally messed up.  I was not the mom I wanted to be.  I felt ashamed, and sad, and disappointed in myself.</p><p> You see, no matter what the circumstances, no matter how justified we are, when we behave in a way that&rsquo;s not congruent with our best we know it.  We feel it.  We cannot escape ourselves.  We carry the shame, and sadness, and disappointment around with us like weights &ndash; not seeing them for what they are &ndash; assassins of our self-belief and efficacy.  We cannot be and bring our best if we don&rsquo;t deal with the messes that we&rsquo;ve made.</p><h3> No matter the circumstances, when we behave in a way that&rsquo;s not our best we know it.  We cannot escape ourselves.</h3><p> <br/> I tiptoed back into Jeremy&rsquo;s room and he bolted up in his bed, alert, like a deer in the wild.  &ldquo;Mom?  Is that you?&rdquo; he whispered in the dark.</p><p> &ldquo;Yes, Honey,&rdquo; I whispered gently.  &ldquo;I&hellip;.I&rsquo;m so sorry I yelled at you.  It was wrong of me to yell like that.  Will you forgive me?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Of course, Mommy.  I&rsquo;m sorry too.  I didn&rsquo;t mean to keep you up.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I said, crawling in beside him.  Within minutes he was sleeping soundly.</p><p> When my alarm went off at 4:30am in spite of the early hour I was glad.  I was glad that I had taken the time to make things right.  How could I teach what I teach, and do what I do, and be who I want to be if I hadn&rsquo;t?  The answer is &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p> Parenting is a great school for learning how to clean up your messes &ndash; and so is work.  How often do you find yourself snapping at someone when you&rsquo;re frustrated, or stressed, or behind on a deadline?  Or hear yourself calling someone out in a meeting (let the public floggings being!)?  Or making blanket threats (&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t hit your numbers heads are gonna roll!&rdquo;)?  Or saying snarky comments in lieu of dealing with the root problem?   What messes have you made in your world?</p><p> Maybe it&rsquo;s time to clean them up.</p><h3> What messes have you made in your world?  Maybe it&rsquo;s time to clean them up.</h3><p> <br/> People are amazing creatures.  They have an enormous capacity for forgiveness when someone has the courage to own their mess.  But if that same person leaves the mess for someone else to clean up, their memory is long.  They may not tell you what you&rsquo;ve done that fractured their trust and belief in you, but they have filed it away as evidence of who you really are.  They&rsquo;ll carry a wariness into the relationship like a shield.  They&rsquo;ll hold back and play it safe, or get the heck out of dodge.

The truth is that since the birth of mankind, people have been wisely making estate plans. Granted, the really early ones probably consisted of valuables buried in a hole marked with a stick, but hey, we had to start somewhere, right? Meanwhile, the reality is that an estate plan can give you peace of mind while you&rsquo;re here &ndash; and make sure your loved ones are protected once you&rsquo;re gone.</p><p> Here are some fun and interesting facts about estate planning:</p><p> 1.

{"original_id":2130,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Top Seven Reasons Why Your Financial Life Is A Mess","link":"top-seven-reasons-why-your-financial-life-is-a-mess","source_link":null,"content":"<p> While there are some who breathe the rarified air of having their financial lives totally together, most people struggle. Your degree of struggle might range from small&mdash;not being sufficiently organized&mdash;to complete and utter meltdown.</p><p> In the messier situations that my clients have faced, I see seven recurring themes. The good news? They are recoverable with the right actions.</p><li> <strong>  Lack of Financial Knowledge. </strong> Unfortunately, we do not teach financial literacy in school as we teach English or Math. But we should. Unless you are fortunate enough to have parents who sat you down and helped you understand money and all the aspects of managing a financial life, you were left to your own devices. As a sound bite society, we take our knowledge from entertainment outlets versus educational ones. If you don&rsquo;t understand the basics of risk management, cash flow, budgeting, retirement planning, education cost planning, tax and estate planning, chances are you are not even asking the right questions. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Not Enough Time On Task: </strong>  Regardless of Wall Street&rsquo;s desire to present themselves as modern mystics operating their secret black box, you are fully capable of understanding financial information. Yes, our busy, over-programmed lives leave very little space for anything but the basic operational aspects of our money life. We pay our bills, collect information for taxes once a year and fill out renewals for our auto or homeowner&rsquo;s insurance; maybe we even look at our investment statements or 401(k) accounts from time to time. But when was the last time you read information that would help you build a broader base of knowledge so you could make better financial decisions? Try putting an hour a week on your calendar to learn something that will help you better understand one aspect of your financial life. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Ego. </strong>  Very few people will stand up and say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, especially when it comes to money. My gender is especially guilty of the caveman &ldquo;I got this&rdquo; approach when nothing could be further from the truth. We are measurers. We measure our success against our friends, relatives, neighbors and colleagues. Our yardstick of success: who has the better car, bigger house or went on a more lavish vacation? Our ego pushes us to spend more than we should on things we don&rsquo;t truly value beyond showing the world that we are successful. As economist Tim Jackson said so well: &ldquo;We spend money we don&rsquo;t have, on things we don&rsquo;t need, to make impressions that don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Money Avoidance. </strong>  If a child burns his fingers on a hot stove, chances are the next time he&rsquo;ll give that stove a wide berth. Adults are the same way. If we don&rsquo;t understand something, we tend to avoid it. The topic of money very often brings up feelings of pain, confusion or associated unpleasant memories from childhood. If you grew up in a family where money was the center of conflict, the mere mention of it may be enough to cause your stomach to feel queasy, your chest to constrict and your brain to retreat into shut down mode. We react because we are wired to react from past experiences. It&rsquo;s our own personal hot stove.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t know whom to trust. </strong>  Open any news website or magazine and you&rsquo;ll be hit with conflicting stories, commercials, sales pitches and predictions of disaster. You&rsquo;ve seen the commercials from the big Wall Street firms that proclaim &ldquo;You can trust us to guide you through your life.&rdquo; And the next page features a story about that very same firm being fined BILLIONS of dollars for screwing the public. Who should you believe? Ignoring the facts because you liked an ad or your boss or your cousin or the guy at the gym likes the firm is not a shrewd move.</li><li> <strong>  Financial Arrogance. </strong>  Financial arrogance is another type of Money Avoidance. Instead of being born out of past experiences, this is more in the realm of &ldquo;I have plenty of time to deal with these issues&rdquo; kind of arrogance. As if whatever fate lies in wait for you cannot possibly affect you until you&rsquo;re good and ready. If you think that because &ldquo;my parents weren&rsquo;t sick a day of their lives and died in their sleep at 98&Prime; you don&rsquo;t need to think about disability or premature death&mdash;you are living in delusion. Or if you refuse to save for retirement because you just &ldquo;know&rdquo; that you&rsquo;re going to inherit, you are probably suffering from the same arrogance.</li><li> <strong>  No Objectivity. </strong>  Being objective about anything that&rsquo;s really important to you is somewhere on the spectrum of rare to impossible. Every parent on the soccer field has a kid who is getting a scholarship to a Division 1 University&mdash;no problem. The same lack of objectivity applies to your financial life. If you&rsquo;re a golfer, the cost of the country club is a necessary expenditure, while your travel-minded spouse thinks golf is a waste of money and a vacation is money well spent. Her cost of personal care and massages is a waste to him; his cost of tools and gadgets is absurd to her. Being objective is really difficult because we see the world as we see it and the things we value are important and necessary. But maybe they aren&rsquo;t as important as we think. <br/>  </li><p> So, what can you do when your financial life is a mess? I guess that depends on whether it&rsquo;s important enough to shift your thinking and take action in your very own best interest.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-20 18:00:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-20 18:00:49.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_5tLelXm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/top-seven-reasons-why-your-financial-life-is-a-mess/\", \"post_id\": \"4837\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-20 18:00:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-20 18:00:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"top-seven-reasons-why-your-financial-life-is-a-mess\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4836\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2168\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Top-Seven-Reasons-Why-Your-Financial-Life-Is-A-Mess-07-14-2015-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"626\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437494400,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2129,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Keeping Pace with Compliance through Document Management","link":"keeping-pace-with-compliance-through-document-management","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When six portfolio managers left their former firm and formed Palladium Registered Investment Advisors, it gave them the opportunity to break away from their paper-based office.</p><p> As Jennifer L. Litchfield, IT Manager at Palladium, remembers it, onboarding more than 1,000 accounts all at once left almost no time to learn a new electronic document management system in the new Norfolk, VA, offices&mdash;even as the need to implement one was clear.</p><p> &ldquo;We added $1 billion in assets under management within three months, so we needed to have everything come together very quickly,&rdquo; Litchfield recalls. Experiences from a prior firm had proven how cumbersome and costly paper was, from the staff effort to file and find information to the yearly accumulation of paper that took up valuable&mdash;and expensive&mdash;space.</p><p> &ldquo;We used to have six or seven employees spend two full weeks every year just merging each client&rsquo;s file with the historical files, purging information where appropriate, and making room for the next year&rsquo;s paperwork,&rdquo; she says.</p><p> As owners of the new firm, Palladium&rsquo;s principals knew that the right technology would make a long-term difference. &ldquo;We wanted to start off our new company with smart decisions when it came to technology and electronic document management,&rdquo; Litchfield says. &ldquo;We made decisions that required upfront commitments of time and money, but produced ongoing savings of both.&rdquo;</p><h3> User-friendly, Customizable and Manageable</h3><p> <br/> The search for a document management system began with three criteria in mind&mdash;and one given: value. &ldquo;We needed it to be user-friendly, customizable to our needs and manageable onsite,&rdquo; Litchfield explains. &ldquo;Cost is always a consideration, so we were looking for a balance between use and cost while considering long-term scalability.&rdquo;</p><p> Litchfield was referred to Laserfiche through the Advent Users Group, a resource made up of companies that use the portfolio management products from Advent Software. John Caso, Solutions Consultant at Laserfiche reseller One Source Document Solutions, Inc., showed Palladium how Laserfiche:</p><li> Enabled users to process and store documents according to customizable template fields.</li><li> Offered multiple searching options using those templates as well as full-text keyword searches. <br/>  </li><p> Litchfield invited users from each department to the demonstration for their feedback. Each, she says, agreed Laserfiche was the most user-friendly solution they&rsquo;d looked at.</p><p> &ldquo;Managers wanted to be able to answer client questions over the phone, so they liked how we could set up the Laserfiche system to feel like their paper files, with the same tabs as the old paper files. The client service administrators really appreciated the advanced search capabilities that helped them find documents quickly and easily,&rdquo; Litchfield recalls.</p><p> &ldquo;Other solutions seemed like they had a pretty big learning curve; Laserfiche is a product that you can open up and it&rsquo;s immediately apparent how you use it,&rdquo; she says.</p><p> The advanced searching, Litchfield adds, would play a significant role from a compliance perspective as well, allowing easier auditing and monitoring of documents. &ldquo;Our compliance officer really needs to be able to slice and dice information, and it was clear Laserfiche was the right choice. Plus everyone would be using the same system, on the same server, so everything&rsquo;s in one place. From a technology, disaster recovery and business continuity standpoint, this was important.&rdquo;</p><p> Long-term, Litchfield and fellow staff agreed Laserfiche was flexible and scalable enough to grow with the firm. &ldquo;We liked how we could set up the folder structure like our paper files and then change it at a later date,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We have ever-changing needs and it was important to have a product that could grow and change with us.&rdquo;</p><p> Palladium purchased Laserfiche in May 2008; implementation took place over a two-day period. &ldquo;We opened in late January, so by then we already had the bulk of the accounts on our portfolio accounting system,&rdquo; Litchfield explains.</p><p> &ldquo;We had onsite support for those first two days to get Laserfiche up and running and train users and administrators. We didn&rsquo;t have a backlog of information, so that helped. We just set the system up, set up individual scanners and got the users trained so that they could start working in the system right away,&rdquo; she adds.</p><h3> Improving Day-to-Day Operations, Keeping Pace with Compliance</h3><p> <br/> Since then, Litchfield says, Laserfiche has been instrumental in streamlining the day-to-day operations of the firm. &ldquo;I hear all the time from our client service administrators how much they love using Laserfiche as opposed to the old way of filing paperwork. Every day, they scan all account documents into the system so all the original paperwork and correspondence is in a single location. We don&rsquo;t have to worry about the storage space and cost for paper documents, or the annual clean up and purging of those documents,&rdquo; she explains.</p><p> &ldquo;Besides our client folders, we also maintain other folders within Laserfiche with information that cannot be changed, including marketing and compliance folders. Because we store copies of custodial statements in Laserfiche, we don&rsquo;t have to keep those hard copies onsite. The only hard copies we keep are our original signed agreements,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;Our onsite storage is minimal.&rdquo;</p><p> In the future, the firm is investigating implementing Laserfiche Workflow business process management. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to automate a lot of our processes that cross departments. Where we currently use Outlook or walk paper around, each person could sign off on a section of a document in the workflow and automatically the next person would get an email saying it&rsquo;s ready for review. We could move paperwork through much more effectively and efficiently,&rdquo; Litchfield says.</p><p> &ldquo;The ability to integrate [Laserfiche] with our portfolio management software is a big step forward. This will make the opening of new accounts a single point of entry, where fields will be automatically populated directly to Laserfiche.

But getting those first customers can feel like a Herculean task. There&rsquo;s so much to track! Right away, you have to know where they hang out online,what their big problem is, how your product solves it and why they should care. Unless your business operates using a freemium model, you&rsquo;ll need paying customers to scale up or pitch investors.</p><p> <strong>  Finding customers, of course, means you&rsquo;ve done preliminary research into a problem.  </strong> It means you&rsquo;ve identified a niche market with room for growth. It means  <strong>  you&rsquo;ve selected an audience for targeting using empathy maps, surveys and market research.  </strong> Learning is always the FIRST step. Don&rsquo;t skimp on it&hellip; the  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/01/our-dangerous-obsession-with-the-mvp/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   IKEA effect  </a> </u>  lurks in the shadows, ready to pounce the minute you ASSume too much about your product-market match.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;ll also need to build your MVP before you can start pitching potential customers. </strong>  Now there are some legendary (and humble) cases where entrepreneurs have gotten customers without a prototype. They sold the product using only mockups and side-by-side analogies (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s like X, only better!&rdquo;).  <u>  <a href=\"https://metricwire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Metricwire  </a> </u>  is one example. These are inspirational stories, yes, but also abnormal. The fact is, most people &mdash; no matter how brilliant they are &mdash; can&rsquo;t envision your product in the dream stage. Seeing really IS believing&hellip;</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve spent any time with us, you know that we&rsquo;re big fans of the lean process. We say lean  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jaymelone/is-your-product-team-really-lean-fd7a39e31ce5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  does not mean </a>  saving money at all costs (get it? money at all costs? ha, ha).  <strong>  It&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; with what you got but executing with speed and efficiency.  </strong> Getting your first few paid customers is a monumental step in the life of your startup. You gotta attack it like a cheetah on red bull.</p><h3> Promiscuously Tap Your Network</h3><p> <br/> That means reaching out to as many likely targets as possible&hellip; quickly. Start with your own contacts. No, I&rsquo;m not talking about friends and family &mdash; charity cases for the most part &mdash; <strong>  unless they truly fit your target profile </strong> . If you&rsquo;ve written or blogged about your industry at any length, then you&rsquo;ve probably built up a list of email subscribers and social followers. That&rsquo;s where you want to begin the search for customers &mdash; with your fans. Fans buy from people they respect. They also respond to survey and interview requests more than non-fans. Fans are honest too; they&rsquo;ll tell you what they like (or hate) about your product. They&rsquo;ll also let you know how your product fits with the professional image you&rsquo;ve cultivated.</p><p> What&rsquo;s that you say? You don&rsquo;t have an email list or 25K followers on Twitter? Relax Beavis! It&rsquo;s not too late to position yourself as an expert and leader in your space. You do that by blogging, writing articles, podcasting, leaving strategic comments on other industry blogs and speaking at industry events. If the content you produce is good, your name will grow. As your name grows, you&rsquo;ll see that customers come to you, ready to buy. Not only customers, other entrepreneurs will find you, happy to do business with a &ldquo;leader&rdquo; and &ldquo;expert.&rdquo; Anonymity sucks when you&rsquo;re trying to launch a product!</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Be Shy</h3><p> <br/> If you have industry connections, hit em&rsquo; up. Ask for feedback. Study whether your product compliments their product. If it does, they might be willing to give you a platform for promoting your product to their network. Product endorsements from trusted sources still carry a lot of weight.</p><h3> Sometimes You Gotta Pay For It</h3><p> <br/> You can also use paid advertising to land your first customers. You could go the PPC route, advertise on individual websites or go full monty and sign up with a DSP (Demand Side Platform) service. However, until you&rsquo;ve discovered a high volume traffic source, with the skillz to convert that traffic, this approach to customer acquisition is tough. It&rsquo;s expensive (especially for SaaS companies) and doesn&rsquo;t provide the nuanced feedback you need to learn about your market. It can definitely be done, but for a lot of startups the better option is&hellip;</p><h3> Old School Sales Tactics</h3><p> <br/> Closing your first customers the old school way is a numbers game &mdash; quantity, quantity, quantity. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you find your targets (lists, directories, websites, referrals), as long as they fit the basic profile of your audience.  <strong>  Your methods for contacting targets should be fast, easy, and replicable. </strong>  That means direct marketing: email, cold calling, maybe even snail mail ( <u>  Homejoy </u> , a Google-backed venture, started by giving out flyers in parking lots). Pick a method and a number (e.g., 100 emails a day). Keep plugging away until you hit the number every day. Once you get used to calling/emailing in volume, you&rsquo;ll be able to up your daily quota. Working faster means getting to those first customers faster.</p><p> <strong>  To make it plain, you&rsquo;re NOT pulling names out of the Yellow Pages or spamming people with a single (crappy) message. </strong>  Although you&rsquo;re using high-volume tactics, the more personal you can make your efforts &mdash; name and company position at minimum &mdash; the better.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s You&hellip; Really</h3><p> <br/> The flipside to customer acquisition is customer disqualification, even repellency. Not everyone is a good fit for your product, some are downright horrible fits! Any prospect that blows you off is not qualified&hellip; at least for the present time.  <strong>  A qualified lead is one who says &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; or &ldquo;tell me more.&rdquo; </strong>  You find out if they&rsquo;re really qualified by listening closely during the conversation. Keep a notepad handy if you&rsquo;re cold calling.</p><p> Obviously,  <strong>  skip anyone on your list whose job title or company makes it clear that they&rsquo;d have no use for your product. </strong>  It&rsquo;s the right thing to do and you&rsquo;ll save yourself time and headache. Your conversion rates will probably be low in the beginning. Don&rsquo;t sweat it. It&rsquo;s not a black mark on you. In this day and age, people scan their emails and rarely pick up the phone.  <strong>  One hundred phone calls might yield twenty live humans, four qualified prospects, and one sale. </strong></p><p> Yeah&hellip; we&rsquo;re talking that kind of optimism!</p><p> But really, we&rsquo;re talking about dedicating yourself to the goal of landing your first customers and not getting discouraged during the hunt. You&rsquo;ll be exercising your resilience, creativity and chutzpah muscles daily. It&rsquo;s excellent training for the future when you&rsquo;re juggling multiple products.</p><h3> Talking to Strangers</h3><p> <br/> What type of script works best on cold prospects?</p><p> Before we get to that, let me say, now is NOT the time to freestyle. Winging it in email will add hours to your work. Winging it on the phone is even worse; you&rsquo;ll forget essential info that your prospect needs to hear before considering your offer. On top of that, all the &ldquo;ums&rdquo; and &ldquo;uhs&rdquo; in an unscripted pitch make you sound insecure and a lil&rsquo; stoopid.</p><p> So the script you use should lead with a benefit. Choose the most valuable one and get to it quickly. There&rsquo;s no need to open with an extended explanation of who you are and what you do; you can always come back to that later. Instead start from their point of view, with the old &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; question. Specificity is always good ( &ldquo;Are you spending more than X on Y each month?&rdquo;) as is empirical statements, &ldquo;Our software can save you 57% more money than Brand X.&rdquo;</p><p> Don&rsquo;t worry if your script is kinda lame at first, you&rsquo;ll be adjusting it throughout your campaign. Use split tests to determine which script is worth keeping. With every response, you&rsquo;ll learn a little more about your audience&rsquo;s pain points. The customer persona you build might end up radically different than the one you started with. That&rsquo;s a GOOD thing. It means you dodged a bullet!</p><h3> Selling Your Soul Not Required</h3><p> <br/> Which brings me to this public service announcement: <strong>  sales is not a dirty word. </strong> It&rsquo;s not the enemy of purity, design or art. It&rsquo;s the lifebloodof all real businesses.  <strong>  No sales = sickly startup. </strong> You need to understand the sales process in order to grow. In the future, when you&rsquo;re scaling up, you&rsquo;ll hire a sales team. If you aren&rsquo;t intimately familiar with how to sell your product, you won&rsquo;t be able to analyze your  <u>  metrics </u> . You also won&rsquo;t be able to decipher the mysterious language of customers, putting you at a competitive disadvantage. Hear me you: a good salesperson never goes hungry for long.</p><p> &ldquo;The hardest customer to get is the first one.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an annoying clich&eacute; but true. Get one customer&hellip; then a second&hellip; then a third and by the time you get to 10, 20, 50 customers, your customer persona will feel like a living, breathing human. <strong>  Adding new customers becomes easier &mdash; even automatic &mdash; once you&rsquo;ve escaped &ldquo;no customers&rdquo; hell. </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-18 19:06:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-18 19:06:48.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_q0dc3Wy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-escape-zero-customers-startup-hell/\", \"post_id\": \"4833\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-18 19:06:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-18 19:06:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-escape-zero-customers-startup-hell\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4832\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2166\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-18-at-12.17.20-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"750\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437415200,"author_id":217,"chart_url":""}

How are you tracking against those goals set in early January? Is there an opportunity to save more money, contribute to a cause, and/or minimize your 2015 tax obligation?</p><h3> Surprisingly, this mid-year financial check-up is often overlooked.</h3><p> <br/> Yet, reviewing the past six months&rsquo; worth of activity can do wonders for achieving your financial goals by year-end.</p><p> If unsure what to look for, start by examining the financial goals set earlier in the year, and focusing on each major aspect of your financial plan. Below are a few tips to help streamline the process and ensure all bases are covered:</p><p> <strong>  Review To-date 401(k) Contributions. </strong> <br/> As you may recall from your initial financial planning, the 2015 401(k) contributions increased to $18,000 this year ($24,000 for those over 50). Take a look at your to-date numbers to ensure you are on track to maximize those contributions. In addition to helping increase your account balance, maxing out those contributions can also reduce your taxable income. Win/Win.</p><p> <strong>  Boost Your Savings. </strong> <br/> With less than six months to go, it&rsquo;s a good idea to review your current savings and consider boosting your recurring contribution, even if it&rsquo;s a small amount. And, while summer can be a drain on your finances&mdash;trips, kids out of school, additional entertainment&mdash;challenge yourself to spend less and save more. It could be as simple as one less cup of coffee per day, or opting for a home-cooked meal instead of an expensive dinner out.</p><p> <strong>  Cut More Fees. </strong> <br/> You may have examined all of the pesky credit card and banks fees earlier in the year. Note that banks are often changing their rules and you might be surprised to learn you are now paying a fee for something you previously received for free. And every fee you pay means less money in your pocket. See how many fees you can reduce or remove before the end of the year. Consider re-investing the dollars saved into a savings or retirement account to really maximize those returns.</p><p> <strong>  Taxes Already? </strong> <br/> Yes, we aren&rsquo;t quite ready to talk about taxes yet. But just because we&rsquo;re not talking about them, doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t be putting yourself in the best position for when the time comes. If you aren&rsquo;t already doing so, get in touch with your CPA and discuss your tax estimate. There&rsquo;s still plenty of time left in the year to mitigate tax consequences, enabling you to have a healthier bottom line in 2016.</p><p> <strong>  Charitable Contributions. </strong> <br/> And speaking of taxes, a great way to minimize your tax expense and contribute to your favorite cause is charitable giving. In fact, the largest source of charitable giving came from individuals in 2014, with Americans giving a total of $358 billion to charity in the year, up 7.1 percent from 2013 (according to <a href=\"http://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  National Philanthropic Trust </a> ). You may even consider checking with your company about a matching program.</p><p> <strong>  Get to Know Your Investments Again. </strong> <br/> While I am a big proponent of letting investments be, now may be a good time to take a close look at your investment portfolio. Many financial advisors encourage clients to assess their risk tolerance before making changes to their investments. While this is an important factor, I would challenge you to determine your capacity for risk. In other words, find out how much risk you NEED to take to reach your financial goals. You might find out that although you can tolerate a high amount of risk, you don&rsquo;t need to take it.  </p><p> And remember&mdash;even if you&rsquo;re not 100 percent on track today, there&rsquo;s still plenty of time to focus your energy on accomplishing those financial goals. Start now, and you may be just be surprised at how smaller actions can lead to greater rewards.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-18 16:39:10.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-18 16:39:10.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_06vnsu2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/its-that-time-again-tips-for-an-effective-mid-year-financial-check-up/\", \"post_id\": \"4831\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-18 16:39:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-18 16:39:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"its-that-time-again-tips-for-an-effective-mid-year-financial-check-up\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4830\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2165\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437196454890-3d5e2273ed57-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"715\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437411600,"author_id":470,"chart_url":""}

In recent years, the spotlight has focused on which new tools and technologies will yield business success. Executives are scrambling to find the latest automation software that will solve all their problems and deliver sales. Michael Karg, CEO of Razorfish, contends that  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/jun/11/intelligence-image-shape-future-marketing-programmatic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;intelligence, rather than image&rdquo; will shape the future of marketing </a> .</p><p> We would argue that the collection of data and technology makes a business more efficient, but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make the brand more likable to consumers and prospective clients. Data gathering is a tactic, not a strategy. Strategically, businesses still need to be asking themselves, &ldquo;How does our image align with our core competencies and values? What do our customers expect to see from us? How can we convey professionalism through design?&rdquo;</p><p> Aesthetic considerations and web copy wording used to be the primary focus, but is now overlooked in pursuit of analytics, tech solutions and automation. Looks are just one of the many facets of modern &ldquo;branding&rdquo; solutions. A business&rsquo;s &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; also includes customer service, social media, blogging, web copy and cohesiveness across platforms just as much as design. In today&rsquo;s post, we make a case for the importance of appearance for brands.</p><h3> Why Appearance Is Still The Top Consideration For Brands:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Branding is about the consumer, not us. </strong></p><p> We&rsquo;ve talked with marketers who find it difficult to convince top executives that a rebranding project is worthwhile. They see the investment in image as an &ldquo;indulgent and unnecessary&rdquo; expense. However, as this brilliant video by DB International so aptly points out, branding isn&rsquo;t about the company. It&rsquo;s about people. It&rsquo;s connecting and resonating with our audiences. It&rsquo;s presenting universal ideas, observations, truths and trends &mdash; visually, in ways that other people agree with and understand.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uaGotppPsCs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"353\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-18-at-9.14.39-AM.png\" width=\"635\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> So yes, the future of marketing will always involve the collection of the data to determine customer preferences and beliefs&hellip; but the real genius comes in reflecting those interests back to people through imagery, tone, words and design. Branding goes beyond a recitation of benefits to touch the heart and soul of what a consumer wants. Consider how  <u>  Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s </u>  connects with their audience&rsquo;s values of sustainability in their imagery and messages.</p><p> The best brands are the ones with a clear understanding of what their company stands for and know how to boil down values, core offerings, customer service style and their knowledge of consumer needs into a presentation that is compelling, pleasing to look at, and simple to comprehend in just a few moments &mdash; because, online, a few seconds feel like an eternity. If a prospect can&rsquo;t look at your website and instinctively reach a desired piece of information within  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/leave-a-website/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the first 10 seconds  </a> </u> , they&rsquo;re gone forever. A good logo and web design quickly essentially says: &ldquo;I know what you want and why you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%23Branding+is+about+the+consumer%2C+not+us.+%238ways&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-appearance-everything-brands/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #Branding is about the consumer, not us. #8ways  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  2. Aesthetics breathe life into your brand. </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/en-us/about/logitech-story\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Logitech&rsquo;s first offering  </a> </u>  was the computer mouse back in 1981.

{"original_id":2125,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Well-Meaning Interview Questions That Scare off Candidates","link":"6-well-meaning-interview-questions-that-scare-off-candidates","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Sure, employers hold the power during interviews with new candidates.  They're the ones in the driver's seat when it comes to hiring or passing on potential recruits day in and day out.</p><p> However, acting too blas&eacute; can have a serious impact on recruitment strategies and finding the right person for the job. The truth of the matter is that well-qualified candidates have options available to them, and saying the wrong things can send them running into a competitor's arms.</p><p> Sometimes, even seemingly innocuous comments can send off flags. We're here to help make sure you don't lose out on talent because of accidental foot-in-mouth syndrome. Here are the types of questions managers and hiring personnel should avoid asking in the interview process.</p><h3> \"Remind me of your name again?\"</h3><p> <br/> This one should be obvious, but not knowing the name of the person you're interviewing tells them right off the bat that you're not invested in them as an individual. It sets an off-putting tone and turns what could be an engaging and personal process for both parties into a rigid affair. Don't make recruits feel like they're a chore. According to a study by  <u>  Elance-Odesk </u> , finding and retaining millennials is hard enough, with 53% of hiring managers claiming to have trouble with it. So there's really no need to stack the odds against yourself.</p><p> Go above and beyond. If they have a last name that's unfamiliar to you, ask whether or not you're pronouncing it correctly. Or, if there's a connection you make with their name (perhaps it's the same as your aunt's), point it out to them. Let them know that you're really considering the human being in front of you, and you'll be doing your part to set the course for a successful interview.</p><h3> \"Which school did you go to?\"</h3><p> <br/> Similar to asking for their name, this question makes it clear that you haven't spent much time looking over your recruit's resume. It's just as important for the employer to be prepared for an interview as it is for the candidate. Not knowing even this level of detail is an immediate red flag, and it can also come off as elitist depending on the context in which it's asked.</p><p> Know which school they went to, know their job history, and instead ask informed questions about how their prior experiences are related to the position they're applying for.</p><h3> \"We don't have time for people who are _____ here ...\"</h3><p> <br/> Unless it's something as simple as \"lazy\" or \"unmotivated,\" using this type of language can signal to prospective employees that your company's management style is dogmatic and unfeeling. Instead use language such as, \"we really value hard work,\" or \"we love new ideas!\" Your recruitment strategies should show them what you're enthusiastic about without giving the impression that you're a totalitarian regime.</p><h3> \"I'm not entirely sure what your position does, but ...\"</h3><p> <br/> If the hiring process has gotten to the point of an in-person interview, whoever's delivering it needs to have a connection to the department. If a manager isn't familiar with the position they're conducting an interview for, they're the wrong person for this task.</p><p> Consider this study from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.edassist.com/resources/news-releases/2015/04/millennials-study-press\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ed Assist &amp; Bright Horizons  </a> </u> , where it's stated that given the choice between two jobs, 60% of millennials would choose the one with a strong potential for growth rather than a job that offered regular raises. If this is the first interaction a prospective employee has with a manager that could potentially influence their development path, they're not going to want any part of your company.</p><p> Instead, make sure the interviewer is well-versed in the position and can walk the candidate through what a typical day in the life looks like. That way they can clear up any lingering questions and help assure the candidate that this is the role for them.</p><h3> \"Who are you as a person?\" or \"What's your defining feature?\"</h3><p> <br/> While the premise of questions like these are nice &mdash; essentially getting to know candidates beyond their interview personas &mdash; they're too much, too soon. Few people could accurately answer if given a week and a Macbook, so getting someone to deliver a coherent treatise on the core of their being in the high-stress environment that is a job interview is a little more than ridiculous. More often than not, they're going to fumble their words and try to deliver lines they think you think sound good. They'll end up feeling confused and uncertain about the interview process.</p><p> Instead, focus on asking questions related to the job and allow them to describe how they'd react under these specific circumstances. You're not interested in how well their zodiac sign fits their personality; you're interested in how they'll perform day-to-day in their role.</p><h3> \"Our last interview was a joke. You're so much better!\"</h3><p> <br/> While this may be meant as a compliment, the subtext can leave candidates feeling confused. On the one hand, they'll find it encouraging to know how they're stacking up against the competition. At the same time, they have no way of knowing whether or not you'll be saying the same thing to the next person who comes in. Even worse, it can give off the impression that you're hypercritical and insensitive towards others &mdash; neither of which are especially appealing traits in a future manager.</p><p> Instead, let them know what you really enjoyed about their interview specifically. If they asked a lot of insightful questions, or they had an infectiously exuberant personality, let them know! Making them feel appreciated can really turn the tide in your favor if their decision comes down to your company or another.</p><p> When it comes to the dos and don'ts of a job interview, the important thing to remember is that this is your first chance to make a positive impression on a potential future employee. Don't scare them away with negative language or by focusing on questions that are unrelated to the position they're applying for. When in doubt, be specific, be personable, and be positive. Doing so could just land you your next rock star.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-18 15:44:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-18 15:44:55.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_ufeEDL6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-well-meaning-interview-questions-that-scare-off-candidates/\", \"post_id\": \"4825\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-18 15:44:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-18 15:44:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-well-meaning-interview-questions-that-scare-off-candidates\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4824\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2163\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1437149639288-c32965270c85-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"778\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437404400,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}

Perelman, CPA, PFS, MST</p><p> For most Americans, social security retirement benefits typically represent 30-60% of their retirement income and yet, according to the National Social Security Association, LLC over 90% of social security recipients receive less money than they are entitled to.  For many filers, this can represent tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost retirement benefits.    </p><p> These results are not surprising when you consider the sheer complexity of the social security system. There are over 2,700 rules that govern social security! In addition, agents at the Social Security Administration (SSA) are prohibited from providing advice on filing strategies as well as on the taxation of benefits. Not all agents are aware of the 2,700 rules.  </p><p> The SSA website does provide valuable information but the filing rules can be extremely complex and confusing.  For example, a typical married couple has over 567 possible ways to file for their benefits. If you are divorced or widowed, the filing rules can be even more complex.

You will need to pay back any benefits received but it will allow you to elect an alternate filing election in the future, which may provide you with increased future benefits.  </p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Start-Stop-Start&rdquo;: </strong> If you elected early (age 62) and later on decide to defer your social security income benefits, what are your options? Once you reach full retirement age (FRA), typically age 66, you can suspend your benefits. This will allow your benefits to increase by 8% per year (called &ldquo;delayed retirement credits or DRC&rsquo;s) plus any COLA. This will result in a 32% increase in benefits from ages 66-70 plus COLA.  </p><p> <strong>  Increasing your benefits while receiving your benefits: </strong> Your benefits are based on your highest 35 years of averaged indexed monthly earnings. If you continue to work while receiving benefits and your earnings are higher than any of the previous 35 years of indexed earnings, your benefits will be re-calculated to reflect your higher current earnings.  </p><p> <strong>  File and Suspend:  </strong> Once you reach FRA, you can elect to &ldquo;file and suspend&rdquo; your benefits, allowing your benefit to grow by 8% per year plus COLA to age 70. Since you have technically &ldquo;filed&rdquo; for benefits (although not receiving them) your spouse will now be eligible to file for spousal benefits at her FRA. You may also be eligible to &ldquo;claw back&rdquo; suspended benefits. For example, if you filed and suspended at age 66 and then reached age 70, you could elect to be paid all of your suspended benefits (excluding any DRC&rsquo;s) from age 66-70 and have your payments start at your age 66 benefit amount. This could be beneficial if you, for example, became terminally ill and needed cash. If you had instead just delayed taking benefits to age 70, without filing and suspending first, you would not be eligible to recapture all of those suspended benefits.  </p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;File and Restrict&rdquo;: </strong> If your spouse had filed for her benefits (and you had reached FRA) you could &ldquo;restrict your benefit to a spousal benefit&rdquo; and collect 50% of her benefit amount.  Then you could defer taking your own benefit until age 70, in order to earn DRC&rsquo;s plus COLA on your benefits. At age 70, you would switch to your now much higher benefits. This strategy will not reduce any benefits that your spouse is receiving.  </p><p> <strong>  Spousal Benefits: </strong> If you get married, you are eligible for spousal benefits once you have been married for at least one year. At FRA, spousal benefits are equal to 50% of your spouse&rsquo;s FRA benefit. The earliest you could potentially start to receive spousal benefits is age 62. Prior to FRA, however, the deemed filing rule comes into play and may require that you elect your own reduced benefit versus your spousal benefit.  </p><p> <strong>  Survivor Benefits: </strong> Once you have been married for at least 9 months, you will be eligible for survivor benefits. Once you and your spouse reach FRA, survivor benefits will be 100% of the deceased spouse&rsquo;s benefit amount, including any DRC&rsquo;s. Survivor benefits are available as early as age 60 (or 50 if you are disabled) at a reduced amount. For example, at age 60 the survivor benefit is equal to 71.5% of your deceased spouse&rsquo;s FRA benefit.  </p><p> <strong>  Divorced Spouse Benefits: </strong> If you were married for 10 years or longer, divorced for at least 2 years, not re-married, and you and your ex-spouse are at least age 62 then you will be eligible for ex-spousal benefits, which are similar to benefits you would have received if you were still married. Collecting benefits off of an ex-spouse will not affect their benefits nor will it affect any benefits of his new spouse if he had re-married. Note: you may also be eligible for ex-spousal survivor benefits in the event your ex-spouse predeceases you.  </p><p> <strong>  Divorced Spouse Remarries:  </strong> If you are divorced and then re-marry, you will no longer be eligible for benefits off of your ex-spouse. However, if you re-marry after age 60 and your ex-spouse dies, you are eligible for ex-spousal survivor benefits even though you had re-married (assuming the criteria noted in #9 have also been met). In addition, if your new marriage ends, due to the divorce or death of your spouse, then you are eligible for widow benefits off of your deceased spouse and also divorced spouse benefits off of your ex-spouse, but not both at the same time.</p><p> Clearly, the rules governing social security income maximization planning are quite complex. In addition to the numerous rules and filing options, one should also take into account one&rsquo;s health status, life expectancy, need for income, how long you plan to work and survivor needs. All of these factors should be considered in determining your optimal filing strategy.  </p><p> <strong>  Your social security filing election may be the most important financial decision you make in planning for retirement. </strong> Coordinating this valuable benefit along with your other retirement assets, and in a tax-efficient manner, is critical in developing a financially sound retirement income plan. If you are approaching retirement perhaps now is the time to take a closer look at all of the numerous and valuable benefits that social security has to offer.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-18 15:09:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-18 15:09:58.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_GGdVGGW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/social-security-10-things-you-should-know-to-maximize-benefits/\", \"post_id\": \"4823\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-18 15:09:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-18 15:09:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"social-security-10-things-you-should-know-to-maximize-benefits\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4822\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2162\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-18-at-8.10.38-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1325\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437392700,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}

However, the blessing of brokenness can be an experience that sets you up and equips you to fulfill your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/3-things-to-help-you-clearly-identify-your-life-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   purpose  </a> </u>  here on earth like no other experience. The blessing of a broken heart can turn the most self-centered person into the most  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/how-to-become-a-person-of-compassion/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   compassionate  </a> </u>  soul.</p><h3> Crippled but Not Disabled</h3><p> <br/> Physical injuries can get some people down and keep them down while others flap their wings and begin to soar higher. A perfect example is my friend and fellow pilot, Carl Hiebert, the author of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.giftofwings.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gift of Wings  </a> </u>  and Us Little People. As a result of a hang-gliding accident, Carl injured his back and has been a paraplegic ever since. Carl was still in rehab when he took up flying ultra light aircraft.</p><p> He has since flown across Canada photographing that beautiful country and traveled the world as a motivational speaker. I had him up flying with me a few times when I still owned a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sc/2ajhuamu2tldcil/AADqTG9ZsJnSRxF-j0SgXHvra\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   helicopter  </a> </u> . When he has asked me if I&rsquo;ll give him some lessons, he just ignored my comment that you need both hands and both feet to fly a helicopter. He just doesn&rsquo;t give up. What an inspiration!</p><p> Carl hosts a fly-in once a year and invites his friends to join him for a barbecue at the farm where he keeps his airplane. I joined him and his friends a few years ago, flying in with my helicopter. Carl raffled off a few tickets for free helicopter rides. The holder of one of the winning tickets drawn was an older gentleman in his mid-sixties. It&rsquo;s funny how our definition of &ldquo;old&rdquo; is always 25 years older than we are at the time. However, this gentleman insisted that his wife get the free ride. I agreed, and he brought his wife over and introduced her to me. She appeared to be the same age as her husband but she was completely blind.</p><p> As we took off, I quickly realized that I needed to be her eyes, so that she too could enjoy the beautiful scenery. I began to describe the sight below. The beautiful green trees, the crops in the fields and the winding Nith River. I described the beauty of the landscape beneath us as well as my limited vocabulary would permit. This lady was just in awe as she kept saying, &ldquo;WOW! This is so-o-o beautiful.&rdquo; I realized with amazement how grateful she was to experience the world through my eyes. (Close your eyes for a minute to understand the view she actually had.)</p><p> I felt tears welling up as I realized that with the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/attitude-big-difference-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   attitude  </a> </u>  this lady had, the rest of the world was blinder than she was. Think about it. Who&rsquo;s better off, the person who can&rsquo;t see or the person who has no vision? Who&rsquo;s better off, the person who has no dreams, or the person who refuses to follow their dreams? Who is more fortunate, the person who is broken on the outside but vibrant, healthy, and whole on the inside, or someone who appears to have it together outwardly but inwardly feels they have no life  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/3-things-to-help-you-clearly-identify-your-life-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   purpose  </a> </u> , are merely existing from day to day, and are dying a slow death on the inside?</p><h3> No Coincidence</h3><p> <br/> Once you understand that nothing happens by accident or coincidence, you will realize there&rsquo;s a purpose for every event that happens in our lives. We are all here for a purpose.</p><p> If you are able to read this, think how much more fortunate you are than my blind passenger is. Take time to watch a sunset. Wake up earlier tomorrow and watch the sunrise. Instead of complaining about what you don&rsquo;t have, begin to give thanks for things you have been taking for granted. Whatever we focus on gets bigger. Start to focus on your assets and blessings. When we begin to count our blessings, our problems have a way of shrinking.</p><p> How has your experience with failure, hurt or brokenness turned into a blessing?

In that case, a consultant in social media will be the wise choice.</li><li> A business coach won&rsquo;t make miracles happen. The business owner needs to realize that he or she has to be ready to make changes, even in their own decision-making. Are you ready to do that? <br/>  </li><p> Sometimes managers just need to be prodded or pushed to understand the realities of their situation rather than simply receive understanding and support. I have found that small businesses need a better understanding of their financial parameters and realities, more than they need someone to motivate them. <br/> <br/> <strong>  What to consider when determining &ldquo;do you need a business coach?&rdquo;: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Determine first what it is you need. </strong> Don&rsquo;t hire someone because they helped someone you know, your needs may be entirely different. Consider the expense and time wasted by searching for a business coach when you&rsquo;re not exactly sure what your business needs.</li><li> <strong>  Have an established contract that states your goal or goals, and how you will measure the business coach&rsquo;s performance. </strong> Agree on a schedule for regular reviews and updates.</li><li> <strong>  With anyone that you hire, check references. </strong> Not just the ones that your applicant offers, but their last three to five clients. <br/>  </li><p> In summary, business coaching can be a wonderful supplement to your business, but it should be not replace good old fashioned research into building better analytics, more accurate measurement, modern technology, better programs and objective thinking in decision-making.

{"original_id":2121,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Fintech Really so Special? Maybe ... Or Maybe Not","link":"is-fintech-really-so-special-maybe-or-maybe-not","source_link":null,"content":"<p> So everyone&rsquo;s excited about Fintech, but Fintech is nothing new.  Fintech is actually pretty old.  I could claim that if Fintech is about providing technology platforms to exchange finance, then that&rsquo;s been around since banks first implemented technology platforms in the 1960s.  In fact, I do claim that banks are Fintech companies.  They are the Fintech incumbents.</p><p> The reason why we&rsquo;re all excited about Fintech is because there are so many new start-up firms attacking the flawed business model of the incumbents.   The startups are starting with no technology from the last century.  They are attacking the flawed business model of the existing Fintech firms, who implemented their technologies based upon products and branch distribution networks. The new firms are built around customers using internet services on their mobile and wearable devices.</p><h3> This is why we&rsquo;re excited about new Fintech, as it replaces buildings and humans with software and servers.  That&rsquo;s the new world of Fintech.</h3><p> <br/> It goes further and deeper than this, as it means that Fintech firms can target narrow finance &ndash; the unbundling of banking &ndash; and just offer component pieces as either peer-to-peer connections, such as lending and credit and payments, or as new ways of connecting, such as buy now and pay later (Klarna) or matching payments data (TransferWise) or creating new digital exchanges on shared ledgers (Ripple).</p><p> That is why we are excited about new Fintech as it destroys the fat overhead of old Fintech.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the old Fintech is not aware of the change.  Most incumbent banks are investing in, developing with, acquiring from or doing something with new Fintech.  The real question is how can an old Fintech bank become a new Fintech bank?  How can a bank move from a product-centric structure based upon physical distribution to a new customer-centric structure optimised for digital distribution?</p><p> This is the fundamental question for a bank, and I claim that to be fit for new Fintech structures, banks have to turn their operations on their head.  The core of the new Fintech is digital distribution, so old Fintech must get rid of their foundation based upon physical distribution.  Once committed to doing this, then the bank can start the change of architecture and organisation to become a digital platform with customer centricity, rather than a physical structure with product focus.</p><p> For many bank leaders, this is too much of a change program. It&rsquo;s too radical.  It&rsquo;s too hard.  For the bank leaders that feel this way, they bolt on to the bank a Head of Digital and give them the job of change.  Don&rsquo;t.   A far better approach would be to launch a new bank, as delegating digital to a job is pretty much a road to ruin.  Digital should be at the core, so delegating the core future of the bank to a job is stupid.  Build a new bank.</p><p> Launch the new bank and let it grow.  Let the new bank destroy the old bank.  Let new Fintech eat the old Fintech dinosaur.  That&rsquo;s far better than just trying to make the old Fintech structure look pretty.  As discussed many times, making old Fintech look pretty by sticking some nice apps on the front-end is just sticking lipstick on the pig, if the core of the bank is still rotten.</p><p> Nah.  Let the new bank destroy the old bank.  That&rsquo;s the best way to deal with Fintech if you&rsquo;ve not got the leadership to change the bank at its core.</p><p> But equally, whilst I post all of this hype about Fintech, we need to take a step back as it&rsquo;s not all cut out to be what it seems to be.  Remember, incumbents are just as much Fintech specialists as the start-ups, but the difference is that the incumbent knows what they are talking about.</p><p> So I was very gratified to pick up an article yesterday about  <u>  <a href=\"https://medium.com/bull-market/a-cynic-s-guide-to-fintech-3cd0995e0da3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Cynics Guide to Fintech  </a> </u> .  The article is written by  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dsquareddigest\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dan Davies  </a> </u> , someone who &ldquo;spent many years as a banks and diversified financials analyst&rdquo;.</p><p> Dan notes that there are at least seven business models being used by the new Fintech start-ups, not all of which are viable.  Some are just plain stupid in his view, whilst others may work if they can get things right.  The seven business models are:</p><li> Thinking that a great big lump of transactions data is more valuable than it is [Dan&rsquo;s Viability rating is just 1 out of 5]</li><li> Reinventing past mistakes of the banking industry because you don&rsquo;t know about adverse selection [Viability Rating is 2 out of 5]</li><li> Assuming that the regulators will be more inclined to listen to your whining than to the incumbents&rsquo; [Viability Rating of 2 out of 5]</li><li> Hoping that a load of people who actively mistrust each other will trust you instead [Viability rating 3 out of 5]</li><li> Trying to use someone else&rsquo;s network and only pay the marginal cost of doing so [Viability rating 4 out of 5]</li><li> Giving customers a worse service for a lower price [Viability rating 5 out of 5]</li><li> Getting your act together with respect to an industry standard where the industry has conspicuously failed to do so [Viability rating 5 out of 5] <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  As can be seen, Dan thinks only 2 of the 7 business models out there right now are truly going to work. </strong>   I don&rsquo;t agree with all, but I do agree with most of what he says.</p><p> New Fintech is exciting where it can get things right.  The P2P credit model and new forms of real-time, almost free payment structures are exciting.  Getting rid of a lot of the old fat in the industry makes sense.  Destroying outdated models that take days to process across borders and cost hundreds of dollars makes sense.  But not everything makes sense.

That seems to be a strong enough case for us to be interested in rising customer expectations.</p><p> One of the major issues in pursuing increasing levels of customer satisfaction is simply the cost of doing so. Simply increasing communications frequency, or the method of messaging (e.g. using video), or having more humans available to provide personal attention, all come at considerable cost to the professional service firm.  Simultaneously we have increasing pressure on what costs can be passed onto the consumer directly, or even entire remuneration models such as commission under threat of extinction.</p><h3> Firm&rsquo;s margins are seriously threatened.  </h3><p> <br/> At the extremes, entire business models are seriously threatened.  The net result is that it is all too easy to be continually chasing ones tail for continually decreasing profitability simply because we are trying to achieve the impossible of meeting the rising customer expectations.  The real problem is that whatever improved or increased level of service a firm provides rapidly becomes the &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; for the client.  The more a firm does, the more that is considered the new &ldquo;standard&rdquo; level of service.  Exceptional service can rapidly be considered the minimum right of the client, so a new level of exceptional is set, which becomes the new normal, and so on and so on&hellip;.</p><p> One of the major customer satisfaction challenges is therefore the Catch-22 of continually improving service levels and thereby laying the foundation for future expectations to not be met.</p><h3> Nevertheless, we must try if we are to stay in business.  It is after all a service business.</h3><p> <br/> Having said that, it is becoming more apparent that the real value lies not in the technical delivery of the service firm, or even its client service levels.  The real value lies in the relationship of trust founded upon the intimate knowledge of the clients hopes, dreams and aspirations.</p><p> A great professional adviser knows more about what is going on inside a client&rsquo;s mind and what their hopes are than most of the clients&rsquo; best friends.</p><p> Right there is the opportunity to exceed client expectations and be highly valued.  Service levels matter, but they just don&rsquo;t matter as much as the relationship level.</p><p> This leads me to think that the smartest investment in raising service standards within a firm are to focus on personalised services that enable the relationship to be deepened and strengthened at the individual client level.  Giving away calendars or a bottle of wine at Christmas time, or running a few technical update wine-and-cheese evenings might be nice, but spending the same money on sitting with the client at a a sports game or the theatre and getting to know more about them individually, and deepening their trust and knowledge of you would seem to be far more likely to result in happy clients that stick with you for the long term.</p><p> Meet the minimum communications and technical service expectations, and deliver those services very well. Incorporate the personal touch everywhere you can while doing so.  But then focus the bulk of your marketing budget and time on creating personalised experiences whereby you have the opportunity to strengthen the relationship &ndash; that is way more valuable to the client than service standards at the end of the day.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.worldinsurancereport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ref: World Insurance Report 2015, by Capgemini  </a> </u></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-17 18:07:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-17 18:07:31.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_zhM415x.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-balance-satisfied-clients-with-profitability/\", \"post_id\": \"4814\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-17 18:07:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-17 18:07:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-balance-satisfied-clients-with-profitability\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4813\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2158\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1434993568367-36f24aa04d2f-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"622\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437391800,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

Essentially, they are small business owners with an endless list of responsibilities and clients who have unbelievably high expectations.</p><p> It is impossible to accomplish all of the daily tasks alone and do them well, but advisors are almost forced to do so because clients and regulators expect this of them. So how can an advisor stay on top of everything while maintaining a healthy balance in their lives?</p><h3> We encourage advisors to embrace insourcing, as opposed to outsourcing.</h3><p> <br/> Outsourcing has a stigma attached to it that the buck is being passed to someone else instead of the advisor maintaining the responsibility themselves. Many people look at this in a negative light. Outsourcing is seen as just getting things off your plate.</p><p> Insourcing, on the other hand, is keeping it on your plate, but not managing it yourself. The key is for advisors to offload the work, but maintain control and responsibility over the deliverables to the client. By delegating certain tasks to someone else, they can focus on their core responsibilities such as investment management and financial planning.</p><p> Advisors insource when they hire staff members. The staff may be assigned to handle client services or social media. But, it is advisable to do it with complementary professionals as well, such as:</p><li> <strong>  CPAs; </strong></li><li> <strong>  Trusts &amp; Estates Attorneys; </strong></li><li> <strong>  Insurance specialists; </strong></li><li> <strong>  Compliance specialists; </strong></li><li> <strong>  Technology specialists. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Instead of hiring someone to come into a firm or farming it out completely, advisors are able to have other professionals to work with directly. Rather than sending clients out, the firm is bringing professionals in, almost like a board of advisors.</p><p> Advisors should look at themselves as the client&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer - someone who oversees the aspects of their plan and the professionals who manage each &ldquo;department.\" The advisor is ultimately responsible for managing the account and reporting back to the CEO, in this case, the client.</p><p> Ultimately everything falls on the advisor&rsquo;s plate, but they shouldn't be the one doing the minute details, every single day. As the COO, hire and oversee a department manager for each one of those categories.</p><p> How much responsibility is sitting on your plate? <strong>  Do you think it&rsquo;s time to create a hierarchy and start to in-source as much as possible? </strong></p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-17 17:31:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-17 17:31:22.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_8eYCNTU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/insourcing-vs-outsourcing-become-the-ultimate-advisor/\", \"post_id\": \"4812\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-17 17:31:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-17 17:31:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"insourcing-vs-outsourcing-become-the-ultimate-advisor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4811\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2157\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-17-at-10.38.14-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"765\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437389100,"author_id":269,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2118,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Only Qualifying Question You May Need","link":"the-only-qualifying-question-you-may-need","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I was working with a client the other day listening to one of their rep&rsquo;s qualifying call, and when the rep presented the cost of the product and asked if that fit within the prospect&rsquo;s budget, the prospect gave an interesting answer.  She said: &ldquo;Well maybe, but it depends.  I&rsquo;ll have to first see if what you have will work well enough for us to make the switch.&rdquo;</p><h3> Question for you: What would you say next? </h3><p> <br/> In the call I was reviewing, the rep then said they should schedule a demo of the product and that during that demo the prospect would learn about how it worked and would then be able to decide.  Is that what you would do?</p><h3> If you said yes, then you&rsquo;re wrong. </h3><p> <br/> Pitching this prospect without having a specific idea of what exactly they are looking for could prove to be a big waste of time.  Think about it: why would you want to spend an hour going over a demo wondering (or hoping) that what you said was enough to make them switch?  And this leads to the only qualifying question you may need. </p><p> The right thing to say here was: &ldquo;And what specifically would you need to see to determine whether it would be worth switching or not?&rdquo; </p><p> This question (and the other examples below) is the one question that will get your prospect to reveal what their precise buying motive is.  And until you understand exactly what it is going to take to earn their business, you&rsquo;re pitching blind.  And this is how most sales reps operate.  Many sales reps think the most important thing they can do is get prospects into their pipeline so they can demonstrate their product or service.  They think that if they can do enough demos, then they will eventually make more sales. </p><p> Smart sales reps &ndash; the Top 20% -- think much differently.  The Top 20% want to know as much as possible in advance of the demo so they can tailor their presentation to the precise buying motives of each prospect.  And to do this, they have to ask the qualifying questions which will encourage a prospect to reveal what those buying motives are.  The above question is specific to what this prospect said to the rep, but below are some other, more general, questions that will achieve the same goal as well.  Find ones that feel comfortable for you to use and then practice, drill and rehearse until they become natural for you:</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #1: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;So ________, what specifically would you need to see in our demo next week that would convince you this would be a good fit for you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #2: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;And let me ask you this: What specifically would you like me to concentrate on during our presentation next week?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #3: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Tell me _________, what area are you most interested in that I can address in detail during our presentation next week?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #4: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, what is the one thing that you&rsquo;re hoping this (your product or service) can do for you and your company?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #5: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;And what would you need to see in the demo next week that would convince you to move forward with this?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #6: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Just out of curiosity, what are three main things this (product or service) must do for you before you would decide to go with it?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #7: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;________ tell me, what one thing could you absolutely not live without &ndash; in other words, what must I be able to show you during the demo for you to be able to decide this could actually work for you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #8: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;What specifically are you hoping this will be able to do for you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #9: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, specifically, what is the one problem you&rsquo;re having that you hope this can fix for you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Qualifying question #10: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;And last, _________, what are you going to be looking to learn more about during our presentation next week?&rdquo;</p><p> As you can see, once you find out exactly what your prospect is looking for, then you&rsquo;ll be able tailor your presentation to give that to them.

You are not only grieving for the loss of your partner, but you must also come to terms with the fact that your life will never be the same again. You will need to make decisions for yourself and any minor children, which can have a major impact on your lifestyle going forward. At a time like this, you need a  <a href=\"http://www.rhondasherwood.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   financial advisor  </u>    </a> who will listen to your needs to deal with urgent matters and longer-term goals, and help you be smart about money in widowhood.</p><h3> How to be Smart About Money in Widowhood: The Steps</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Financial Issues in the Early Days After Losing a Spouse </strong></p><p> When your spouse first passes away, you will most likely have immediate expenses (funeral costs) to look after in addition to your day to day household costs. The first order of business is to understand your cash flow needs and what income or investments there are to cover them.</p><p> You may be too overwhelmed at this point to work out the numbers yourself and so you may want to seek advice and guidance from people you trust. Remember, everyone will have thoughts on what you should do; however, few understand your personal situation. This is where a financial advisor can greatly add value as they can create a personalized cash flow statement for you based on your unique circumstances and advise the best way to cover your money needs going forward.</p><p> <strong>  Major Life (and Lifestyle) Change </strong></p><p> While over time, you will start to feel more in control of your life and financial situation, the days, weeks and months immediately following the loss of your spouse will no doubt be very difficult. All of the new found responsibilities and decision making often become overwhelming, especially if you have been appointed as the executor of your spouse&rsquo;s estate. The paper work will be never ending. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help from family and friends who have been through this process or from your financial advisor. This is a time when you are most vulnerable and so it is essential that you are dealing with people who have your best interest at heart.</p><p> Hopefully, you and your spouse did some estate planning beforehand so all their assets pass through to you seamlessly and preferably through &ldquo;joint tenancy&rdquo;, as beneficiary or through the Will. If your spouse passed on without a Will then they will have died &ldquo;in testate&rdquo;. This will be another painful process to undertake. Seeking legal guidance is advisable.</p><p> <strong>  Looking at the Financial Road that Lies Ahead: After the Estate has been Settled </strong></p><p> At this stage you will need a lot of information to make the best decisions for your financial future. The first thing you should do when you are ready is to gather all your financial documents (Will, insurance policies, investment and bank account statements, papers to your home) and make an appointment with your financial advisor. Your advisor can provide you with several ways to plan for the unexpected and how to manage your investments going forward.

There may be issues you will have to deal with such as having to downsize your home or seek employment , which could add more stress to your life.

Insurance is one of the greatest gifts you can leave to your spouse after your passing.

{"original_id":2116,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Questions to Unlock What Owners Want","link":"three-questions-to-unlock-what-owners-want","source_link":null,"content":"<p> \"I've been thinking of selling my business.  Can you help me?\"  Many advisors to business owners are hearing this question with increasing frequency.  After all, most of your entrepreneurial clients have likely been thinking about exiting their businesses for years.  When they finally decide to meet with you, their first question is usually about an exit path, \"Who should my successor owner be?\"</p><p> Owners usually start the conversation looking for advice about which exit path (sale to management, a third party, children or an Employee Stock Ownership Plan) is best for them.  In offering advice, advisors respond with descriptions of the merits and demerits of each exit path.  Advisors base their suggestions on their experiences with clients in similar situations.  This approach is normal, but often (if not usually) wrong.</p><p> It is wrong because it jumps the gun:  neither owner nor advisor has a full understanding of the owner's goals.  They spend time trying to answer questions rather than asking questions to determine what the owner wants and needs in exiting the business.</p><p> Contrast that approach with one founded on understanding the owner's exit goals and aspirations for herself and her business.  The successor owner is but one of several of an owner's exit goals.  There are several other universal exit goals and your job is to help owners understand and quantify all of them.</p><h3> We suggest that you begin by asking three questions--each based on uncovering one of the three universal exit goals. <br/>  </h3><li> ​After you leave the business, how much money do you want each year for the rest of your life and your spouse's life?</li><li> When do you want to leave your business?  And what does \"leave\" mean?</li><li> Who should be the new owner of your company? <br/>  </li><p> The owner's foundational goal, these universal goals and an owner's aspirational goals provide the framework for all planning and execution.  Once clarified and prioritized, you know when the owner wishes you leave, how much money or income the owner needs from the business, and whom the owner wishes to be the successor owner.  You will design the owner's Exit Plan to achieve these goals.</p><h3> The benefits to owners of this \"Goals First\" approach are obvious, but there are several to advisors as well. <br/>  </h3><li> ​Focusing initially on an owner's exit goals makes it clear that you see your role as helping the owner, not yourself.  You are not selling a service or product; your purpose is to help owners reach their goals.  We call this owner-centric planning.  This approach increases your credibility and an owner's trust in you immediately.</li><li> Spending time now on careful goal selection saves time and money later.  Setting goals is the natural starting point for all Exit Planning and execution.  Starting any other way means that, at some point, you and the owner will have to back up and clarify the goals and aspirations you initially overlooked.  </li><li> You and your client create the construct to include all of the owner's goals into plan creation.  Choosing a successor is just one goal; not the only goal.  In last week's article about the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/most-important-exit-goal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   foundational goal  </a> </u> , we saw that the choice of a successor is not the most important goal that the owner much achieve in order to have a successful exit.  Post-exit financial security holds that place.</li><li> You and your client focus on the planning and actions needed now.  Once you establish the owner's foundational goal and the three universal goals, you now may find that no exit path is capable today of taking the owner where he wants and needs to go.  In that case, it is best to focus effort on growing transferable value, minimizing risk and income taxes rather than on taking steps toward a sale or other transfer of ownership interest. <br/>  </li><p> Once you help owners to establish their foundational and universal goals you can move to their aspirational goals.  Foundational and universal goals are the framework for the Exit Plan you will design and execute for this owner.  The owner's aspirational goals dictate the exit path that is best for them.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-17 15:37:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-17 15:37:24.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_cvQGcSw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-questions-to-unlock-what-owners-want/\", \"post_id\": \"4806\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-17 15:37:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-17 15:37:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-questions-to-unlock-what-owners-want\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4805\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2154\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436046903831-45947c3adf3f-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"686\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437411600,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2115,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Collaborating or Compromising with Your Partner?","link":"are-you-collaborating-or-compromising-with-your-partner","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  There is no more effective way to agitate a mediator than to suggest that the result of a mediation was a compromise for all involved.  </strong> While compromise is a basic negotiation practice, where both sides give up something they initially wanted in order to reach an agreement, it is sometimes looked upon as a lose-lose outcome; finding a quick middle-ground where everyone is left dissatisfied to some degree.  Compromise is often necessary, especially to resolve a complicated issue when there are time constraints, but it is sometimes used as a shortcut and prevents a solution that would have been more positive for all sides, but requires more time, skill and discussion to achieve.</p><p> In a business partnership resolving conflicts though continued compromises rather than taking the time to look for ways to collaboratively find solutions can lead to resentment and ongoing tension.  Partners must compromise on small issues for the sake of efficiency, but knowing the difference between small things and seemingly small things that are part of bigger problems can be tricky. When there is a compromise, what is often remembered is what was given up, rather than what was received.  As uncertainties play out, what was given up may take on even more weight.</p><p> Researchers Ralph Kilmann and Kenneth Thomas designed a diagnostic to test natural tendencies for dealing with conflict on a matrix plotting cooperation and assertiveness (below).  Predictably, compromise is plotted in the middle, neither fully assertive nor fully cooperative: the ultimate middle ground.  Collaboration is seen as both fully assertive and fully cooperative, an approach to conflict that should fully satisfy the concerns of those involved.</p><h3> How to stay out of a cycle of compromise and move toward collaboration:</h3><p> <br/> The ability to collaborate is what most people are looking for when they are part of a partnership; it is based on the idea that partners are on the same side in facing the challenges of their business, but their interests can sometimes become unaligned and collaboration becomes very difficult.  In these cases, compromising serves as a stop-gap measure until the partners have the time to dig deeper into the issues.  In many businesses, however, there never seems to be time to step back and assess, so it is important to:</p><li> Take the time to understand the underlying issues in a conflict; especially those that arise repeatedly.</li><li> Consider the issue from the perspective of your partner, even building a case for their view.</li><li> Think creatively about solutions; become comfortable with discussions that include unconventional approaches. <br/>  </li><p> Partners generally know when they are doing too much compromising and not addressing underlying issues.  Imbedding these techniques into your partnership communication can prevent serious conflict and help focus on managing your business.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"229\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-17-at-6.48.13-AM.png\" width=\"273\"/></p><p> chart: Kilmanndiagnostics.com</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-17 13:48:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-17 13:48:00.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_hB0HKsz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-collaborating-or-compromising-with-your-partner/\", \"post_id\": \"4804\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-17 13:48:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-17 13:48:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-collaborating-or-compromising-with-your-partner\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4802\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2153\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436076863939-06870fe779c2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1699\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437393600,"author_id":478,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2114,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Here Comes the Groom","link":"here-comes-the-groom","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When it comes to wedding day attire, the bride to be has been dreaming about what she will wear since she was five. The groom on the other hand usually starts thinking about his wedding gear months before the wedding date &ndash; typical guy, last minute planning. With so much focus around the bride, men can often feel overlooked or confused about what exactly he should wear when he says &lsquo;I do&rsquo;&hellip;Suit or tux? Bow-tie or long tie? Vest or Suspenders?  Decisions&hellip;decisions&hellip;</p><p> Your wedding day is a celebration, which is why you should dress for the moment.  What you wear should compliment your ceremony and general wedding theme; yet at the same time reflect your personal style. Remember this is as much your special day as it is your lovely wife to be. Show everyone you want to look as good for your bride as she does for you.  To shed some light on the subject, I&rsquo;ve come up with a few tips and pointers to dapperly direct you to the altar.</p><h3> Wedding Formality</h3><p> <br/> Knowing the level of your wedding&rsquo;s formality will definitely be a key factor in what your wear that day. Again its dressing for the occasion &ndash; you wouldn&rsquo;t go tailgating in a suit and tie would you?! Probably not. There&rsquo;s always a time and place to dress up, your wedding day is one of them.  Here&rsquo;s a simple guide on what&rsquo;s appropriate:</p><p> <strong>  Black Tie  : </strong> Tux is a must! This type of wedding is at the top of the formal pyramid; it&rsquo;s like the Academy Awards for weddings. Buy one or rent one, just make sure you arrive in one.</p><p> <strong>  Formal  : </strong> Depending on what time your wedding takes place a suit or tux can be worn. A good rule of thumb is if your ceremony takes place after 7pm, then channel your inner &lsquo;James Bond&rsquo; and wear a tux. If it starts before 7pm, then as Barney Stinson would say &lsquo;Suit Up!&rsquo;</p><p> <strong>  Semi-Formal  : </strong> Planning a beach wedding or a country wedding? Stick with a suit, but leave the wool behind. Opt for a lighter material, try cotton or linen blended fabrics. </p><p> <strong>  Causal  : </strong> Dress slacks and a button down shirt are ground zero. From here you can add a vest for a little something extra. Or if you&rsquo;re feeling like you&rsquo;re ready to be the best dressed groom you can be, then throw on a jacket for the ceremony &ndash; you can always remove it at the reception.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Forget Your Flair</h3><p> <br/> Keep it simple with little bursts of your wedding colors. Try not to go overboard, this isn&rsquo;t Chotchkie&rsquo;s. At a minimum two pieces will do. Express your personal style with a colorful pair of socks or suspenders.  Maybe you show your true colors around your neck with a vibrant tie or bow-tie if you&rsquo;re feeling trendy. If you&rsquo;re looking for just a splash of color, then a pocket square is right up your aisle. </p><h3> Last Little Tip</h3><p> <br/> Ask your bride the color of her dress. You&rsquo;re probably thinking &ldquo;Its&rsquo; white, duh!&rdquo; Yes it&rsquo;s white, but there are literally 50 shades of white if not more. The reason I recommend this is for pictures.  Photography picks up everything these days, especially HD photos. The contrast between a stark white shirt and your bride&rsquo;s diamond white dress, will stick out like a sore thumb. If you&rsquo;re planning on wearing a white shirt, coordinate the color of white to match your bride&rsquo;s gown this way you blend together beautifully as your enter your union of love.</p><p>  </p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-16 19:50:38.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-16 19:50:38.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_CI1FgFg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/here-comes-the-groom/\", \"post_id\": \"4801\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-16 19:50:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-16 19:50:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"here-comes-the-groom\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4800\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2151\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1090082_10153111283050273_1811644659_o.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1134\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437159600,"author_id":251,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2112,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Using Plan Design to Help Avert Women's Retirement Disasters","link":"using-plan-design-to-help-avert-womens-retirement-disasters","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You can help your female employees avert the women&rsquo;s retirement issues that can run them out of money in retirement them. According to the 2014 AEGON Retirement Readiness Survey, half (49%) of women in work are not confident they will be able to retire with a lifestyle that they consider comfortable. The Center for Fiduciary Studies provides ERISA fiduciary education and training or financial advisors and employers. The Center says workforce demographics should be factored in when making decisions about your plan. We believe addressing this issue does not have to be very time-consuming or expensive.</p><h3> What are the issues unique to women&rsquo;s retirement success?</h3><p> <br/> Women face a variety of potential challenges not always shared by their male counterparts:</p><li> Women live longer.</li><li> Women are more likely to be solely dependent in their later years because of the loss of a husband, partner or just being single</li><li> Stepping in and out of work to raise children and care for parents and/or parents-in-law</li><li> Overreliance on husband to accurately plan for retirement. Spending dollars on the care of other rather than on their own retirement <br/>  </li><p> Each woman&rsquo;s situation is unique. These issues can be experienced in varying combinations with varying impacts. It is critical to customize a savings approach incorporating issues that a woman might uniquely face.</p><h3> Why do women find it so hard to save for retirement? </h3><p> <br/> The most important factor in explaining women&rsquo;s retirement preparedness is their attitude toward savings. Overall, just over one-third of women (36%) claim to be dedicated savers whose approach is always to make sure they are saving for retirement (which is not necessarily the same as &ldquo;saving enough&rdquo;). For these women, the question that remain are you saving enough based on your expected returns and the income you&rsquo;ll need to live a lifestyle you can tolerate. For the other two-third, your first order of business is getting them into the savings habit period. Moreover, an adequate savings plan based on their income goals is critical to women&rsquo;s retirement comfort.</p><h3> What plan design features can employers use to help women&rsquo;s retirement?</h3><p> <br/> Automatic enrollment is a great jump start. It helps guide your employees to start saving. Are your female employees leaving valuable matching dollars on the table? That is lost opportunity cost on savings and compounding growth. Moreover, consider a default rate of 6% or more. A match of 3% of that 6% gives your employees a 9% total savings rate.</p><p> For context, the Employee Benefit Research Institute found a 25-year-old female currently earning $40,000 would need to be save 15 percent for a 90 percent probability of success. A 25-year-old female earning $65,000, would has a 90 percent success rate at a 9 percent contribution rate. That does not take into account lost contributions from having children and other caretaking she may find herself thrust into during her life.  Under the same set of assumptions, a 25-year-old male currently earning $40,000 would need to save approximately 14 percent for a 90 percent probability of success. If that male makes $65,000, an 8.2 percent contribution rate equates to a 90 percent rate.</p><p> Are your women employees skilled investors? Most individuals are not regardless of gender. Consider helping your employees with by using a professionally managed portfolio as a qualified default investment alternative to give them professional investment advice. If you are using a qualified default, was employee demographics, age gender, etc. considered in the decision-making? Unfortunately, many plan sponsors have been led to believe that target date strategies are the only qualified default choice.  Your demographics might point to using a balanced fund or risk-based choice.</p><p> If you have many women that have been in and out of the workforce they may be better served with the static risk/return of a balanced investment strategy or a risk based one. Target date strategies are more appropriate for younger populations who can benefit from the breadth of the varying risk/return changes in the strategy.</p><p> If you are familiar with a defined benefit plan, you know that actuaries look at issues like investment returns to recommend savings rates. If returns are poor, then you must contribute more. Do employees understand that the same goes for them in a defined contribution plan?</p><p> Why not provide your women employees (all employees for that matter) one-on-one advice as opposed to education that tailors a savings strategy based on their unique circumstances? Most people aren&rsquo;t robots and want an adviser that is looking out for their sole interest. A CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&trade; professional (CFP&reg;) working in a fiduciary capacity can provide this women&rsquo;s retirement planning advice. This assessment can be provided on campus, by webinar, during or after hours.</p><p> I believe you should customize an education and advice plan for your employees. The 401(k) was developed in part to supplement retirement income from defined benefit pensions and social security. Even social Security isn&rsquo;t straightforward. There are various Social Security claiming strategies that can improve a women&rsquo;s retirement lifestyle. I was able to help provide an additional $700 in monthly cash flow to one of my clients. Effective strategies may be able to compensate for the lost credits from work interruptions to care for family.</p><p> Sounds good but appears time consuming? Hire a fiduciary, outsourced Chief Retirement Officer to help guide you through the process. We believe key credentials include, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&trade; professional and fiduciary credentials such as Accredited Investment Fiduciary&reg;, Professional Plan Consultant&trade; and Qualified Plan Financial Consultant.

If you&rsquo;ve seen those articles, you&rsquo;re familiar with one of my &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; statistics related to that relationship. This particular statistic comes from feedback from more than 11,000 candidates my company  <a href=\"http://www.milewalk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  milewalk </a>  has interviewed: four out of five employees have cited their boss as one of their top three reasons they are open to leaving their current company.</p><p> As eye-popping and completely believable as that statistic is, the fact remains that there are entirely too many inept bosses in the world. What&rsquo;s worse is that many of you work for one of them.</p><p> Whether it&rsquo;s performance appraisal time, end-of-the-year-salary-review time, or any given Tuesday, many of you face the internal anguish related to whether to &ldquo;speak up&rdquo; regarding your happiness. My answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with a few qualifiers.</p><h3> Those qualifiers are what ultimately make the difference when expressing yourself because how you say what you say is just as important as what you say.</h3><p> <br/> Your work-related unhappiness generally comes in a finite number of forms. You are either tired, bored, underappreciated, underpaid, working in an environment that is void of growth opportunities, commute too far, travel too much, work too many hours, are crammed in a small office (if you have one), and so on. I&rsquo;m sure you get the picture because you&rsquo;re probably living it Monday through Friday while I smile as I write this on a Saturday.</p><p> When you share your feelings, make sure to highlight what you want rather that how upset you are regarding what you don&rsquo;t want. For example:</p><li> It would make me much happier if I had more opportunities for growth. Mr. Boss Man, can you help me identify those?</li><li> It would really be helpful if the organization showed appreciation for the effort of its employees. Ms. Boss Woman, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be a grand gesture. Any small sign would go a long way.</li><li> Is there any possibility I could telecommute one day each week? It would really help with my productivity, blah, blah, blah. <br/>  </li><p> Notice I did not once use a negative word or badmouth the employer (even though they likely deserve it). You either need something that&rsquo;s missing or need to remove something that&rsquo;s present. Those are your entire list of choices.</p><p> You know your operating environment and can adapt for what realistically works. The most important point is that it&rsquo;s more beneficial to express your feelings positively and with respect than to gossip and behave like a jilted school child.</p><h3> One for the road&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Some of you might have noticed I write a daily line called Today&rsquo;s Line to Live By (book coming soon!).

It can definitely be. But believe it or not, the traits that make a person controlling often are highly desirable, such as being focused, detail oriented, making quick decisions, seeing things clearly, and acting with efficiency. If, however, controlling people neglect to pay attention to the impact their behavior has on others, relationships will begin to deteriorate. Controlling behavior becomes negative and damaging when the controller doesn&rsquo;t focus some control on their own behavior.</p><p> Controlling people want to have things done their way, no matter what and as a result they close off the views, ideas and creativity of others. In a partnership where the relationship is of key importance, one person cannot be in charge all of the time. Unless this is part of the agreement between them (and this is not likely), chances are the partnership will soon be in jeopardy.</p><p> Beyond the partnership itself, controlling behavior in general is incongruent with the goals of growth, expansion and creativity. No matter how creative the controlling person is, this type of behavior is constrictive rather than expansive.</p><h3> Would You Like to Change the Dynamic?</h3><p> <br/> It can be a challenge for controllers to accept options and ambiguity, but in the end, if they can train themselves to accept shades of gray instead of black and white, the world of possibilities expands.</p><p> If you are a controlling personality, use your ability to control your own behavior, especially in regards to others. Start by beginning to notice how others, especially your partner(s) experience your behavior and how they feel when you attempt to control. You might even ask them. Take some time to consider everything from the other person&rsquo;s point of view. It&rsquo;s called good listening and empathy. It&rsquo;s a willingness to understand the other and to accept the fact that there is more than one right way to do things. Doing this does not mean you both or all won&rsquo;t decide to do it your way. It simply brings respect into the relationship, an absolute necessary element for successful partnerships.</p><p> Have conversations about this dynamic of control in a matter of fact manner. Stop the conversation if it becomes argumentative and emotional. If it is too difficult to have the discussions hire a coach to facilitate. This minimal investment can go a long way to help your relationship succeed.</p><h3> More Suggestions:</h3><li> Develop a willingness to try someone else&rsquo;s ideas.

{"original_id":2106,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Tips To Help You Relax Now","link":"5-tips-to-help-you-relax-now","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Fact: There is nothing less relaxing than when someone tells you to &ldquo;Relax!&rdquo; They may have the best of intentions, but their less-than-helpful advice sounds more like a stress-inducing command. When we&rsquo;re anxious, overwhelmed, or stressed, the last thing we need is more pressure to change our state. Here are 5 counter-intuitive strategies to help you cope:</p><h3> 1. Stop Trying To Relax.</h3><p> <br/> Just notice the tension without trying to change it. How does it feel in your body? Where do you feel it? Take a deep breath and allow yourself to just be. Validate yourself by saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to feel the way I feel.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Be Mindfully Less Mindful.</h3><p> <br/> Try this exercise: Instead of concentrating on one thing, allow yourself to stare off in the distance. Gradually expand your vision to include nearby objects until you take in the whole scene. This exercise helps to open our mind and body, putting things in perspective and easing tension.</p><h3> 3. Accept That You Have No Control.</h3><p> <br/> This may be the hardest, but most powerful truth: In this moment, things are beyond our control. So for the next 10 minutes, stop trying to change things and practice getting comfortable with uncertainty. As Mark Nepo says &ldquo;We are the only creatures that seek out guarantees, and in doing so, we snuff the spark that is discovery.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. Stop Being A Perfectionist.</h3><p> <br/> Perfectionism and high standards often come from a fear of not being worthy or good enough. Try relaxing your expectations by trusting that no matter what action you take (or don&rsquo;t take), you are still worthy exactly as you are. As I write this blog post, I&rsquo;m accepting that it isn&rsquo;t up to my usual standards. And while that annoys the stickler who lives inside my head, I know that success comes from executing even when we&rsquo;re unready and uncertain.</p><h3> 5. Take A Step In The Right Direction.</h3><p> <br/> What&rsquo;s one thing you can do right now to feel more ease? Is it taking a tiny action toward your goal? Is it going outside for a walk? Each good decision creates momentum that propels us forward and helps us to regain our confidence and self-trust.</p><p> And when all else fails, there are videos of baby animals on YouTube.

{"original_id":2105,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Successful People Know About Decision Making","link":"what-successful-people-know-about-decision-making","source_link":null,"content":"<p> After a few reps at the gym your muscles naturally start to fatigue. It&rsquo;s a sign that you&rsquo;re working and your muscles are responding. In the same way that your muscles eventually give out during a workout, your mental muscle starts to fatigue throughout the day, hampering your ability to care, make choices, stay motivated, weigh decisions, and ultimately take action.</p><h3> Radishes and chocolate chip cookies can help us understand why.</h3><p> <br/> In 1998, Roy Baumeister and colleagues asked people to sign up for what participants thought was a taste-perception experiment. The researchers formed three groups: radish eaters, chocolate-chip cookie eaters and non-eaters (control group). They asked the participants to skip one meal and arrive hungry for their scheduled appointment. When the radish and chocolate-chip cookie eaters arrived for the appointment, they could smell freshly baked chocolate-chip cookies. On the table before them they found a bowl of beautiful red radishes and a plate of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and chocolate candies.</p><p> The radish eaters were instructed to eat two or three radishes and told they could not touch the chocolate-chip cookies or candies. The chocolate chip cookie eaters were instructed to eat two to three chocolate chip cookies and/or candies but not to touch the radishes. The non-eaters did not participate in this part of the study.</p><p> Once the participants had finished eating, the researchers asked all three groups to solve an unsolvable spatial puzzle. The subjects could abandon the task at any time.</p><h3> Who quit first?</h3><p> <br/> The radish eaters. The chocolate chip cookie eaters and non-eaters stuck with the task longer and for more or less the same amount of time. The early quitters, the radish eaters, reported feeling more exhausted than the other two groups.</p><h3> So what do these odd food choices have to do with making a company-wide decision or considering change?</h3><p> <br/> It takes significantly more self-control to avoid the temptation of mouthwatering chocolate chip cookies and candies than it does to avoid eating radishes. Resisting temptation took a bigger toll on the radish eaters. That resistance depleted the mental energy needed to tackle the puzzle and thus the radish eaters to abandon the task more quickly. On the other hand, subjects in the chocolate-chip eating and non-eating conditions depleted fewer mental resources maintaining self-control and could more easily spend additional time with the puzzle.</p><p> If resisting cookies can make your mind weary, imagine what resisting a big change in the workplace can do to you, after adding in all the other stuff you do every day. Resources like willpower, decision-making acuity and focus are depletable properties of the brain. New and unfamiliar routines and choices challenge the comfort zone of our ingrained habits. When we effect a change or resist something that we would normally not resist, we force ourselves out of our comfort zone.  It requires energy and can wear you out.</p><p> Psychologists call this ego depletion or simply, mental exhaustion. It&rsquo;s a state of mind where you can lose critical elements of your self-control and other mental processes that require focus and conscious effort.</p><p> So think about it in these terms. Your alarm goes off. You make a decision about whether or not you are going to press snooze. Then you decide how frequently you are going to press snooze. Then you get out of bed and make a decision about whether or not you are going to take a shower. Hopefully you make the right choice. Then you decide what you are going to wear. Then you decide if you are going to work out. Then what to eat. Then what the kids are going to eat. Then what direction you are going to drive to work. Then this and then that. By the time you get to work, you have made so many decisions already that your decision-making capabilities are already depleted. The good news is that if we know this universal truth about our brains then we can operate a bit differently.</p><h3> Here are some very simple things you can do to counteract the radish effect: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Routinize as much as possible: </strong> The more of a routine you have in the morning (e.g., waking up at the same time, eating the same thing for breakfast, having a system in place for prepping everything, etc.) the better off you are. When you leave options open in the morning, you are tapping into your limited well and causing depletion on tasks and things that really don&rsquo;t require much thought. For that matter, if there are any tasks that can be routinized throughout the day, not just the morning, do so. Your brain will thank you when you have to focus and decide on the things that really matter.</li><li> <strong>  Do what you can do the night before: </strong> Before you go to sleep at night take care of the things that are easy to take care of for the next day (but can deplete you if you focus on them in the morning). Making simple choices like what you will eat for lunch tomorrow, what you will wear, or fleshing out tomorrow&rsquo;s to do list will minimize the amount of energy you need for making these choices the next morning.</li><li> <strong>  Have a uniform: </strong> I am not suggesting wearing the same thing every day. However, I am suggesting finding a few looks that work for you and buying that look in different colors. The less time you spend agonizing over which shoe and belt works best with which pants or skirt, the more mental energy you will have when you are helping a client decide on the best avenue to take with your product line. Ever notice that Steve Jobs wore the same outfit every day? Some of the most successful people may not have the most creative outfits but they certainly make up for it with their power brains.</li><li> <strong>  Be diligent about replenishment: </strong> We all know we need to sleep, eat well, exercise, take breaks, allow for mindfulness and relaxation. But very few of us are as disciplined about these aspects of human functioning and performance than we are about checking our emails, responding with urgency, working around the clock, constantly being on, and all the other stuff that goes hand in hand with depletion. Be as diligent about creating the space for replenishment as you are about working. Elite athletes and performers understand that they can only practice for a set amount of time before they require rest. The same is true for every human and their mind. The mind is an athlete and can produce extraordinary results if provided with the replenishment it needs.</li><li> <strong>  Make the most important decisions first thing in the morning: </strong> Knowing what you know now, don&rsquo;t save the life altering and company-altering decisions for the end of the day. If you have an important decision to make at work or in your personal life, do it first thing in the morning. Do the difficult stuff when you are the least mentally taxed and save the easy stuff at the end of the day.</li><li> <strong>  Sleep off the emotion: </strong> If you are having a strong emotional reaction (positive or negative) to something, keep the decision at bay until the storm of the emotion blows over. Although emotions are incredibly informative and provide useful information, when an important decision is made through the lens of emotion, decision-making can become skewed. Give it some thought and let it marinate over a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Remember, negative emotions can skew logical thinking just as much as positive emotions can. Unless you&rsquo;re an emergency room doc, you probably can give the decision 24-48 hours to marinate. <br/>  </li><p> Being disciplined with these simple steps gives your mind the foundation it needs to be rock solid when it comes to making decisions and tackling problems.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-16 15:33:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-16 15:33:14.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_VekeKeY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-successful-people-know-about-decision-making/\", \"post_id\": \"4780\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-16 15:33:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-16 15:33:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-successful-people-know-about-decision-making\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4779\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2140\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-16-at-8.32.10-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"608\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437168600,"author_id":156,"chart_url":""}

Come clean and say what you believe and people will follow you.</p><h3> If \"authenticity\" strikes you as an overused buzzword, look no further than Trump's surging poll numbers to grasp its raw power.</h3><p> <br/> Despite being flawed and offensive to some, Trump says--repeatedly--what he means without trying to please anyone else.</p><h3> Love or hate his positions on issues, you know where he stands and why.</h3><p> <br/> Don't get me wrong--being inflammatory, infamous, or vapidly compelling isn't leadership, particularly if the leader's vision is in some way damaging to people, their values, and/or the needs of the majority. That said, in an almost Rain Man-like manner, Trump reminds us that authenticity powerfully connects people hungry for true leadership with the ideas of those who may lead.</p><p> So whether you're a seasoned executive, emerging leader, or even a presidential hopeful, it's important for you to consider a few things on a daily basis: a) what needs saying that you're avoiding saying, b) what you ARE saying that is somehow misaligned with what you believe, and c) which things you tell your closest friends and allies are just what those you wish to lead need to hear from you.</p><p> Authentic leaders put what they believe to be true at the top of their list, and then adapt those ideas to the absorption styles and rates of others. Less authentic leaders put agendas first, and then attempt to spin their messages into webs of influence. Not so compelling.</p><p> What are you holding back? Synchronizing what you say with your principles makes your messages powerful and honest, and that enables you to inspire others to do their best on your behalf.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-16 15:03:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-16 15:03:49.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_R48RK6V.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/trumps-unlikely-lesson-on-leadership/\", \"post_id\": \"4778\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-16 15:03:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-16 15:03:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"trumps-unlikely-lesson-on-leadership\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4777\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2139\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-16-at-8.05.15-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"596\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437134400,"author_id":131,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2103,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Content Types You Need To Stand Out","link":"the-content-types-you-need-to-stand-out","source_link":null,"content":"<p> New communication channels pop up every day and brands are scrambling to find the right  <u>  content </u>  type to support their  <u>  marketing </u>  efforts. This post is going to outline many of the popular  <u>  content marketing </u>  forms, and some of their relative strengths and weaknesses. We&rsquo;ll give you an overview of the possibilities and help you figure out which ones to use and which ones to avoid.</p><p> <strong>  1) Blogs </strong></p><p> Your company&rsquo;s blog can serve all kinds of purposes, introduce new products, answer questions or even humanize your brand. Depending on the platform, it can include images, links and video. A blog offers great flexibility, but if you want to keep readers engaged and coming back, avoid becoming overly repetitive. For a good laugh, read Forrest Wickman&rsquo;s Blog Post about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/05/24/blog_post_vs_blog_this_blog_post_is_not_a_blog.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the difference between writing a blog post and blogging a blog  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  2) Guest Blog Posts </strong></p><p> Bringing a guest blogger onto your company site, or guest posting on another blog, not only introduces you to new audiences, it helps build links from other related sites. It can also lend a fresh voice and some new perspective to your blog.</p><p> <strong>  3) eBooks </strong></p><p> When you&rsquo;re covering a topic in depth or want to establish your expertise in a given field, an eBook is a great option. It can also become an option in a growing library of content that you reference on a regular basis. Check out Entwine&rsquo;s latest eBbook &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/entwinecreativegroup/20-reasons-why-your-business-needs-a-blog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   20 Reasons Why You Need a Business Blog  </a> </u> &ldquo;.</p><p> <strong>  4) Info-graphics (Visual Images) </strong></p><p> Ok, I&rsquo;m personally not really big on creating visuals (we&rsquo;ll just call it temporary laziness) but many people really dig them. Let&rsquo;s face it, an image is worth 1,000 words because they are retained for a longer amount of time. So if you have a long list of bullet points, think about converting the that into an image. Here&rsquo;s a great informative image  <u>  <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2014/09/15/content-marketers-time-find-new-blogging-trend/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   within this post  </a> </u>  by  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TexasGirlErin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Erin Robbins O&rsquo;Brien  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  5) eNewsletters </strong></p><p> Keep in touch with regular customers with an email newsletter. Including special offers isn&rsquo;t a bad idea, as long as you&rsquo;re giving them something of value.  One of my favorite newsletters comes from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.psychotactics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sean D&rsquo;Souza  </a> </u> , author of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.psychotactics.com/products/the-brain-audit-32-marketing-strategy-and-structure/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Brain Audit  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  6) PowerPoint Presentations </strong></p><p> A PowerPoint presentation shared online via  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SlideShare  </a> </u>  becomes a completely different thing than the one you presented. Remember, you won&rsquo;t be there to explain the salient points and key ideas. You&rsquo;ll need to simplify and notate accordingly. Still, these can be a nice way to share internal ideas.</p><p> <strong>  7) Podcasts </strong></p><p> You can share interviews, information and ideas via this audio-only format, but here&rsquo;s one you&rsquo;ve got to put some effort into to do well. Andrew Davis wrote a nice piece on  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/09/spark-content-creation-creativity-podcasts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8 great podcasts  </a> </u>  you should emulate.  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnleedumas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John Dumas  </a> </u>  of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Entrepreneur On Fire  </a> </u>  is a leader in this field and has interviewed top global entrepreneurs.</p><p> <strong>  8) Videos </strong></p><p> According to the Content Marketing Institute,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/CMI/b2b-content-marketing-2013-benchmarks-budgets-and-trendsnorth-america-14855770?ref=http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2012/10/2013-b2b-content-marketing-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   70% of B2B marketers are using videos  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s a great way to demonstrate an idea, engage an audience, and showcase your brand. The advent of increasingly affordable video production tools is making this format easier and cheaper than ever. Just make sure the cheap video you produce doesn&rsquo;t look cheap. A great example here is from  <u>  <a href=\"http://lewishowes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lewis Howes  </a> </u>  who helps entrepreneurs grow their business.</p><p> <strong>  9) Micro-videos (ie, Vine) </strong></p><p> The 6-second snippets of video Twitter&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"https://vine.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vine  </a> </u>  channel displays are the newest playground for content marketing brands. Dunkin Donuts aired the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2013/09/10/Dunkin-Donuts-ESPN-Vine-091013.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first TV ad made from Vine videos  </a> </u>  last year. Called the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jeffbullas.com/2013/05/24/five-people-rocking-vine-with-great-video-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Instagram of Video  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; your ideas had better be short and sweet if you want to use this channel.</p><p> <strong>  10) Social Media Posts </strong></p><p> Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google+ all offer the ability to engage directly with your audience and it&rsquo;s easy to push information to them via  <a href=\"http://www.hootlet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hootlet </a> . This tool lets you share on the fly with just a click of a button. Sharing video, images and even links to other formats can work here. To make things even easier for you,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hootsuite  </a> </u>  allows you to schedule your content in advance and spreads your messages over time. The pro verison gives you even more power by enabling other users and suggesting content that you might like.</p><p> <strong>  11) Webinars </strong></p><p> When you want the chance to make an impression on your audience with your presentation style and knowledge, a webinar lets you be there without actually having to go there. Recorded and re-aired at a viewer&rsquo;s convenience, a well-done webinar can also become part of your content library.</p><p> <strong>  12) White Papers </strong></p><p> Building authority and expertise means sharing ideas, and when a 500-word blog post isn&rsquo;t enough for your idea, a white paper gives you the platform and space to say more. Put the time and energy into making something excellent and a white paper can pay dividends for months.</p><h3> Become A Content Machine </h3><p> <br/> Your audience is everywhere, so you have to meet them on the channels they prefer. You can do this re-purposing your existing content. You&rsquo;ll find that some content marketing efforts work better than others for your particular market and that&rsquo;s ok because its not a one size fits all world.  You just need to go and test for yourself what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Either way, you must always look to improve your content and mix things up so it looks fresh.</p><p> Stop creating dull content. Your audience wants unique content that stands out. </p><h3> Quality Content Always Wins</h3><p> <br/> If you want to stand out from the crowd, spend your time delivering the best content possible. Remember your readers won&rsquo;t stick around to read a lot of fluff; they have a purpose and are seeking answers.</p><p> You need to quickly demonstrate that you can solve their problems through your offerings without pushing a hard sell.  Start by giving something of value, build trust, and over time, they will come to you for additional help.</p><h3> What Type of Content Marketing Do You Practice? Content marketing is all about being consistent so once you found something that works, you need to stick with it.  What type of content works best for your organization? I'd love to hear from you.   </h3>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-16 14:48:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-16 14:48:40.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_UNfGGb1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-content-types-you-need-to-stand-out/\", \"post_id\": \"4776\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-16 14:48:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-16 14:48:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-content-types-you-need-to-stand-out\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4775\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2138\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AAEAAQAAAAAAAALSAAAAJDM2ZTUxMzgzLTgzYTItNDQ2Ny1iNGQwLTRkZDdjYjc0YTQyMQ.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"518\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437138000,"author_id":271,"chart_url":""}

No Money!","link":"the-digital-ad-dilemma-no-trust-no-money","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When was the last time you heard a marketer say they&rsquo;d spend more money on TV advertising  <u>  only if there were more reliable measurements? </u> Yet, at least based upon  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/07/06/marketers-say-they-would-spend-even-more-on-digital-ads-if-measurement-improved/\" target=\"_blank\">   this study  </a> </u> , reliable measurement is holding digital advertising spend in check.</p><p> According to a new study by WPP agency  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.millwardbrowndigital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Millward Brown Digital  </a> </u> , more than 70% of marketing executives polled said they would increase their spending on mobile, digital and social platforms if there were better ways to measure return on investment.</p><p> Really?! Look, people may cut their TV ad budgets because they can&rsquo;t afford it, or they feel it&rsquo;s not worth it&hellip; But saying they&rsquo;d spend more for better TV measurement? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p><p> <strong>  There is a digital ad double-standard. </strong>  It&rsquo;d be one thing if the study said that a steady stream of up-and-coming big data players offering incremental improvement in measurement would mean significant churn for existing companies already in the field &ndash; that would have made sense. If you&rsquo;re not offering continuous improvement to your clients&rsquo; ROI, you should be in trouble because Big Analytics isn't enough - marketers need Accurate Big Analytics. But the study didn't say that. What it said is execs are withholding spend entirely. Question: Where are those marketers going to spend that money instead - TV? Print? </p><p> <strong>  The digital double-standard is a curse of digital&rsquo;s own making. </strong>  Better analytics &ndash; better data &ndash; has been the competitive differentiator used by digital players from the start &ndash; &ldquo;Stop wasting marketing dollars!&rdquo; &ldquo;Spend money on real potential customers!&rdquo; It was and remains the perfect sales narrative because digital can, and frequently does, offer the kind of accuracy marketers crave. That, and everyone knows that TV measurement sucks. The result? Every company, shop, platform and brand delivering internets-based advertising &amp; marketing has a sales story built on better measurement for better targeting for better ROI. It's just that many of those shops, platforms, companies &amp; brands haven't delivered the accuracy they claimed they could.</p><p> <strong>  An entire industry suffers when you overpromise and under-deliver. </strong>  The double-standard persists because gaps remain between the quality of measurement promised by all of these companies (collectively) &ndash; that&rsquo;d be the ROI - and what&rsquo;s actually delivered &ndash; you know, that whole Brand Promise / Customer Expectation thing. And the sad truth is, some of these wounds are self-inflicted.</p><h3> Welcome to the bullet points of broken promises:</h3><p>  </p><li> ​There&rsquo;s the less-than-scrupulous websites that generate false views with auto and/or background refreshing.</li><li> There are the ads designed to encourage false clicks &ndash; which is particularly common on mobile.</li><li> There are click validation problems &ndash; I can&rsquo;t be the only one who marvels that my pay-per-click campaigns always manage to sell exactly the number of clicks I have budgeted.</li><li> There are the well-known spammy accounts on Twitter, for example.</li><li> Heck, the industry can&rsquo;t even agree upon how to count a unique user in the first place (see this  <u>  <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-we-still-cant-agree-on-web-metrics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   primer article on fivethirtyeight  </a> </u>  about cookies). <br/>  </li><p> The list of trust-eroding behaviors goes on and on&hellip; The result? CMO&rsquo;s and VP&rsquo;s of Marketing are left feeling that digital can&rsquo;t deliver what they have been promised - in this case, measurement that they can trust. Or, more to the point, measurement that won't get them fired! Because let's face it, that's what this is about - these execs need to trust that the measurement promise is real so that they can convince the CFO to give them more money to spend. No Trust? No Money. </p><p> <strong>  Digital at its worst still offers better measurement than TV ever did. </strong> But then again, TV never promised precise measurement to begin with &ndash; so no trust fracture could ever occur in the first place. Which is why, contrary to what the findings of the study imply, measurement is not the problem. The problem is that the consumers of digital advertising products &ndash; the CMO&rsquo;s and VP&rsquo;s &ndash; have suffered an erosion of trust in the whole ecosystem as a result of incremental broken promises. And until \"Digital\" can get that trust problem solved, we&rsquo;re going to have to keep reading about these studies that say marketers would spend more on digital if only they had better tools for measuring the effectiveness of their campaigns.

{"original_id":2101,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Kevin O'Leary Enters the #ETF Shark Tank; DFA Too!","link":"kevin-oleary-enters-the-etf-shark-tank-dfa-too","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I woke up this week to a fun tidbit in my inbox delivered by my friends at KCG. In the morning ETF note, the writers broke the news (to me, at least) that Kevin O'Leary and his amazing marketing machine were debuting the first of what seems to be several ETFs from the Shark Tank personality.  Reports are that the new ETF traded nearly 345,000 shares on day one and has $5 million in assets.</p><p> From a third-party perspective, O'Leary has seized the uptrend of popularity in ETFs and paired that with his formidable marketing footprint that includes, but is not limited to, his role on Shark Tank, his recurring commentary slots on CNBC and a significant social media presence.   This surely will be a great case study to examine whether a great marketing machine can/should come before a good investment product idea - or if the marketing success of an ETF is a function of the quality of the product. </p><p> While the average investor was likely more aware of the debut of O'Leary's ETF, a more impactful item to most industry insiders was the news that Dimensional Fund Advisors - a titan of a firm built on its commitment to exclusive distribution via trained and approved advisors - has entered into an agreement with John Hancock to launch ETFs.  According to the statements, these ETFs will only be made available inside insurance and investment products packaged by Hancock.   But, to me, it isn't about DFA getting into ETFs (after all, that is really a small leap from mutual funds), but moreso about the fact that DFA will have a new avenue for distribution that didn't exist before.</p><h3> Anyone who follows investment marketing knows that distribution is a fundamental for long-term success.  </h3><p> <br/> DFA has long counted on the maintenance of a tribe of trained advisors who loyally allocate client dollars to DFA's relatively low cost fundamental index investing approach.  Until recently, the financial advisor distribution model for retail investments had very little threatening its standing. However, there has been enough noise being made my upstart robo-advisors that custodians and broker-dealers have advanced their own direct to consumer offerings.  That has left DFA to ponder their future.</p><p> Give them credit in addressing this disintermediation of the financial advisor by aligning themselves with another investment product that most investors can ill-afford to forgo: life insurance.  The partnership with John Hancock is an acknowledgement of the trend and positions DFA to remain relevant, whether or not their traditional financial advisor sales force remains relevant in the ever-changing world of financial services.</p><p> So, take the news headlines at face value or dive deeper to see what they are really telling you. ETFs are not a fad, they are now the representative of the industry establishment.  DFA didn't decide to get into the ETF business for ETFs' sake alone, rather they used the move to diversify their distribution.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-16 14:32:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-16 14:32:42.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_q8ZV5DV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/kevin-oleary-enters-the-etf-shark-tank-dfa-too/\", \"post_id\": \"4772\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-16 14:32:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-16 14:32:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"kevin-oleary-enters-the-etf-shark-tank-dfa-too\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4771\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2136\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-16-at-7.31.49-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"923\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437132600,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

Have you laid the groundwork for a successful execution? </strong> <br/> <br/> Let's start by defining \"customer experience strategy.\" <br/> <br/> A  <strong>  customer experience strategy </strong>  helps you define, design, and, ultimately, deliver the desired customer experience (desired, of course, by your customers). Strategy is mainly about the how, but your CX strategy may also include details about the who, what, when, and the how much of experience design and helps everyone focus on those activities or improvements that will be most impactful to your customers. (It gets everyone on the same page, marching to the same beat.) There should absolutely be a hook into your corporate strategy. <br/> <br/> Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat. -Sun Tzu <br/> <br/> Customer experience strategy is one of the six competencies of the Customer Experience Professionals Association's ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cxpa.org/?\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CXPA  </a> </u> )  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ccxp.org/exam-resources/exam-blueprint/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CCXP exam  </a> </u>  and something every customer experience professional should be well versed in/about.

Relationships are more important than our accomplishments.&rdquo; &mdash;Joel Osteen</p><h3> Why Relationships Matter</h3><p> <br/> Relationships play a role in every area of our lives; every experience, every lesson learned, every accomplishment. Our businesses are built on relationships, our friendships, our communities, and our families are all dependant on our ability to develop strong relationships. Relationships serve as a barometer, telling us if someone is a friend or a foe.</p><p> When it comes to your relationships, are they based solely on strategic positioning, or are they built on trust? Are they authentic? Are they rooted in looking out for each other&rsquo;s best interests, or are you each in it only for yourselves?</p><h3> Built on strategy?</h3><p> <br/> Ross Perot believes, &ldquo;Business is not just doing deals; business is having great products, doing great engineering, and providing tremendous service to customers. Finally, business is a cobweb of human relationships.&rdquo; Are your relationships focused only on the deal? Relationships based solely on strategy are usually one-sided; they are manipulative and unsupportive. Are you focused on what&rsquo;s in it for you? If you find yourself only doing for others because you expect something in return, you are in a strategic relationship.</p><h3> Built on trust?</h3><p> <br/> Albert Einstein told us, &ldquo;Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.&rdquo; Trusting connection is what brings relationships to life. Are you treating others the way you would like to be treated? Relationships built on trust are open and welcoming. In these types of relationships you are seeking to create win-win situations. Your communications are transparent and honest, and your intentions are clear. If you are each looking out for the best interest of the other, you are in a trusting relationship.</p><h3> Build Strong Relationships</h3><p> <br/> Strategic relationships are like a game of chess, except no one wins in this game. Mona Sutphen said, &ldquo;Most good relationships are built on mutual trust and respect.&rdquo; When you build strong relationships you create shared successes. You feel comfortable in these relationships knowing that your communications are honest, that they are not self-serving, and they are mutually supportive. Relationships are the vehicle with which you gain influence, create situations in which everyone wins, and achieve your goals. Building strong relationships which are based on trust, not strategy, is the key to success in your business, in your community, and in your home.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-15 19:18:54.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-15 19:18:54.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_4exolLn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/relationships-strategy-or-trust/\", \"post_id\": \"4766\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-15 19:18:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-15 19:18:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"relationships-strategy-or-trust\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4765\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2133\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1223708-girls-and-boys-love-938x586.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"679\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437073200,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

The technology we use to create and produce video is becoming more accessible with apps like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Periscope  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/cameo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cameo  </a> </u> , which means more people are watching user generated videos. The success of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is just one example of people using their smartphones to create engaging video content. Who needs a professional crew when the equipment is available and you can do it yourself?</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l8kjhmIM9JM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"247\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-15-at-11.58.32-AM.png\" width=\"447\"/> </a> <br/> Click to view.</p><p> For brands and organisations, user generated content can be a powerful tool to humanise what you do and achieve new levels of engagement. In education, as Helen wrote recently, the fundamental interaction between pupils and teachers can finally be replicated, helping to realise  <u>  the potential of online video to transform education </u> .</p><p> But while the quantity of videos being uploaded is increasing, our expectations of quality haven&rsquo;t changed. There is a recognition for the need for video as a promotional or knowledge transfer tool. Unfortunately, more often than not, tight budgets or a lack of skills are leading to poorly produced videos.</p><p> While audiences may not be conscious of exactly how they know it, they do make decisions about a publisher based on the quality of the content they see. For any organisation or business with a reputation, this can be massively damaging.  <u>  <a href=\"http://go.brightcove.com/en-highcostoffree?cid=70114000002Qu8S&amp;pid=70114000002Qw0p\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research by Brightcove  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2011/cs7270_spring/what-matters-video-quality.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Screen Digest  </a> </u>  discovered the following:</p><li> If viewers watch a poor-quality video, 62% of those are more likely to have a negative perception of the brandthat published that video</li><li> 23% would think twice about buying from a brand with poor-quality video</li><li> The majority of respondents - 9 in 10 consumers - said video quality was important and while HD resolution was a key factor, high-quality sound actually mattered more. <br/>  </li><p> There are three dimensions to a quality video production: the technical, the editorial and another that is becoming increasingly important: the experience of watching the video. The sweet spot for quality is when a video is a perfect balance of these three aspects. Let&rsquo;s look at each of these in more detail, why they matter and tips on ensuring quality with each.</p><h3> 1. Editorial</h3><p> <br/> You can have the most technically polished video but if the idea is weak with a flimsy script, then it will mean very little to your audience. Before any production starts, it needs a strong story and a rationale. Why should they watch and listen to what your video has to say? Are you offering your viewers real value? The audience should be able to take your content, use the information you&rsquo;ve given them and respond to it.</p><p> What that response is depends on what your goal is. It could be thought-provoking, persuasive, entertaining or inspiring. Whatever it might be, the mark of high-quality video content will be seen in the audience&rsquo;s response, which comes from sound editorial guidance.</p><h3> 2. Technical</h3><p> <br/> With a strong idea ready to go, the technical side should convey the story in the clearest and most impactful way possible. Every creative decision should be made with the story at the forefront. For the majority of knowledge transfer videos and vlogs, these basic tips should help.</p><p> <strong>  a. Sound </strong></p><p> As the study I mentioned earlier showed, respondents rated sound above picture resolution as more important to the quality of a video. It&rsquo;s particularly important when it&rsquo;s tied to an action, like when someone is speaking and you can see their lips moving. Anything that&rsquo;s unexpected will be a distraction, like wind damage, speech being out of sync or the outside sound of passing cars when the subject is sat inside an office. <br/> <br/> Quality sound should be clear, detailed and consistent. If you notice how bad it is or find yourself switching off while someone is talking, chances are the sound just isn&rsquo;t good enough.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  b. Framing </strong></p><p> When pointing the camera at your subject, make sure that they&rsquo;re the first thing that the audience sees. Too often there are videos where a company banner or the favourite office plant dominates the screen at the expense of the person speaking. Don&rsquo;t point the camera at anything that detracts from the story or message.</p><p> <strong>  c. Lighting </strong> <br/> <br/> Lighting is an art form in itself but the basics are straightforward. Like sound, it should be consistent and stay on the subjects, helping to focus the viewer&rsquo;s attention and holding their gaze.</p><p> <strong>  d. Focus </strong></p><p> A simple pointer, but make sure your subject is in focus. A blurry subject isn&rsquo;t comfortable on the eye and is distracting.</p><p> Previously, the editorial and technical aspects were enough to determine the quality of an online video production. But now a third dimension has emerged: the online video platform.</p><h3> 3. Video viewing experience <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jznO2SHI0l8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-15-at-12.00.04-PM.png\" width=\"446\"/> </a> <br/> Click to view.</p><p> As the lines between web and video  <u>  become blurred </u> , the viewer experience has become an increasingly important part of online video. Online video platforms (OVP) like YouTube or Vimeo should deliver a seamless viewing experience, which means you can rely on a video player to stream your videos with no problems.</p><p> While it may seem obvious, it isn&rsquo;t always the case.  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.brightcove.com/en/2013/11/infographic-youtube-and-high-cost-free?buttonb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brightcove asked 1,204 consumers  </a> </u>  about their responses to poor video experiences of YouTube, the world&rsquo;s leading online video player. Out of the viewers, one third said they abandoned videos halfway through because they failed to play. Remember the findings I quoted earlier about poor video experiences leading to negative perceptions of that brand? While your videos may be technically and editorially produced to a high standard, if it doesn&rsquo;t playback, it&rsquo;s practically worthless. Not only that, but it will damage your company or organisation&rsquo;s reputation. <br/> <br/> So, having a reliable OVP is a key component of a high-quality online video (I explore why in more detail in  <u>  this post </u> ). It&rsquo;s a simple idea, but developers and filmmakers are combining to create video experiences with some incredibly creative and powerful results. For best in class examples, check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://lifeonhold.aljazeera.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Life on Hold  </a> </u>  from Al Jazeera and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/MadilynBailey/ChooseYourView\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Choose Your View  </a> </u>  from YouTube.</p><h3> Is quality always important?</h3><p> <br/> When considering all this, is video quality important all of the time? Actually, no.</p><p> Smash hit viral videos like Charlie biting a finger and popular video bloggers like Russell Brand and PewDiePie don&rsquo;t have the highest technical specs for their videos.</p><p> In politics, Chuka Umunna was  <u>  heavily criticised </u>  for using Facebook video to announce his short-lived campaign for Labour leadership, but it gave him a platform to speak directly to his target demographic without meddling or framing from the traditional media. What better way to distance yourself from the Westminster club, which is rightly criticised for its close links to the media establishment, than to produce and publish your own video on your own terms?</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/chuka-ummuna-media-training-leadership-bid.jpg\" width=\"450\"/></p><p> Chuka Umunna - criticised for using Facebook video to annouce his leadership bid.</p><p> Crowd funding videos are another grey area. A polished well-produced video can put off potential donors if they&rsquo;re suspicious of big budgets already being spent on expensive promotional campaigns. It can conflict with the good will and grassroots nature of the platform. <br/> <br/> Overall though, when it comes to deciding between user generated and professional produced video content, refer back to your  <u>  goals and strategy </u>  and what your video content is aiming to achieve. When planning your video production, simply ask yourself: can you afford to risk the reputation of your brand or organisation with poor quality video?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-15 19:04:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-15 19:04:21.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_aJJBRwX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/does-the-quality-of-your-videos-really-matter/\", \"post_id\": \"4764\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-15 19:04:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-15 19:04:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"does-the-quality-of-your-videos-really-matter\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4760\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2132\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/technical-video-production-quality-blog.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"785\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-executives-new-social-networks-jay-palter?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437074100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

But there are ways in which to adjust your competitive edge to avoid the appearance of stepping on others yet be seen as the leader you are meant to be.</p><h3> Mindset</h3><p> <br/> The number one key is to change your mindset from competing with others to one of competing with yourself.  All else fades away.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter nearly as much what others think and do, when you learn to focus on all that you bring to the table. </p><p> Ask these questions of yourself:</p><li> Are their subject matters I need to learn?</li><li> Where have I lost business and is there a consistency to this?</li><li> Is it possible to increase the time and effort I am putting into seeking out new prospective clients?</li><li> What are new and varied ways to increase audience attention?</li><li> With whom might I collaborate or seek help from to ultimately increase clientele? <br/>  </li><h3> Sales Decline</h3><p> <br/> Frequently, when sales dwindle, it&rsquo;s because a continuum of prospective clients has been on the decline.  Losing sales tends to dampen morale, and that works against contacting new people.  It becomes a vicious downward cycle.  But by recognizing the downturn, and taking action to reverse results, you will soon see a positive trend once again.</p><h3> Action</h3><p> <br/> Take note of each activity and calculate the number of calls, meetings, email, and online followings.  Now create an action plan to increase each in order to record higher numbers a month from now.  A running task list will keep you more productive and on target for what needs to be done.  The most important competitive edge is the competition with yourself.  Your fiercest competitor is you.  Be of the mindset to that &ldquo;yes you can produce&rdquo; and accordingly, you will do so beyond original expectations.</p><h3> Lead</h3><p> <br/> Now that you are experiencing increased success once again, find a community that may benefit from your expertise.  Volunteer your time to teach.  Student questions may also add valuable insight for you to learn even more.  Share your newfound knowledge online to grow followings further.  The best part of this type of work is in the reward found by helping others.  On occasion, surprises come your way with new business and partners to be found. </p><h3> Strength</h3><p> <br/> By focusing on your only true competitor, your internal self, you come out on the other end stronger than ever before.

The &ldquo;term&rdquo; is the expected amount of years in which you are expected to repay your loan. Banks typically offer 5, 10, 15, and 20 year repayment terms. The biggest consideration to keep in mind is how much you can afford to pay now, and how much interest you will accrue over the lifetime of repayment. For example, on a 5 year term you will accrue the least amount of interest during repayment, but your monthly payments will be the highest vs. a longer term student loan.</p><h3> 2) Does the new student loan have a variable or fixed interest rate?</h3><p> <br/> Your student loans have either variable or fixed interest rates. By refinancing your student loans, you can convert a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate loan or vice versa. Fixed interest rates tend to be less risky, whereas variable interest rate loans fluctuate due to economic conditions. You can  <u>  learn the difference between variable vs. fixed interest rate student loans here </u> .</p><p> Due to the 2008 recession, interest rates over the past 4 years have been historically low. If the economy improves, interest rates will most likely rise over time, making variable interest rate student loans less favorable when compared to fixed rate student loans. In the current economy, fixed rate student loans tend to have a higher interest rate, which means you might end up paying more interest over the long term.</p><h3> 3.) What are the repayment terms?</h3><p> <br/> When does the repayment start? What will my monthly payments be? How do I pay? What fees can occur if I miss a payment or default on my student loans? Is there a 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH automatic payment withdrawal?</p><h3> 4.) Is there an origination fee?</h3><p> <br/> Some banks charge a student loan origination fee up to 2% of the total amount you are requesting to be refinanced. For example, if you refinance $60,000 in student loans, you will pay a $600 for a 1% origination fee. The origination fee is usually added to the loan amount due and you will not need to pay this amount upfront.</p><h3> 5.) Will they combine both federal and private student loans?</h3><p> <br/> Some financial institutions, such as  <u>  Darien Rowayton Bank </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sofi.com/refer/143/1193?source=SLH_006_AE_1436984246397\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SoFi (Social Finance)  </a> </u>  are now refinancing federal and private loans bundled together. This can ultimately help you get a lower interest rate to save money, but be careful as you lose most alternative and flexible repayment plans associated with the federal government loan program.</p><p> You can read more about refinancing your federal loans here:  <u>  <a href=\"https://studentloanhero.com/featured/should-you-refinance-your-federal-student-loans/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Should you refinance your federal student loans?  </a> </u></p><h3> 6.) Do I need a cosigner? Do you offer cosigner release?</h3><p> <br/> If your income or credit score is too low, the bank might require a cosigner to insure your student loans in the case of default. Alternatively, lenders such as  <a href=\"http://lendkey.7eer.net/c/157051/187810/3276?subId1=SLH_006_AE_1436984246397\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  LendKey </a> , offer cosigner release, which releases any existing cosigners from your student loans. This can help free up revolving credit for your cosigners and allow them to make other purchases such as a mortgage or auto loan.</p><h3> 7.) What are the typical credit score, salary, and debt-to-income requirements?</h3><p> <br/> According to our research, most banks require a ~680 credit score or higher, 45% maximum Debt-to-Income ratio and minimum monthly salary of $2,000, depending on your total debt load. Be sure to ask the credit score requirements before submitting your application.</p><h3> 8.) What are the maximum amounts of debt they will refinance?</h3><p> <br/> Banks typically have a maximum amount of debt they will refinance. This amount is varies by bank and education level, such as undergraduate, graduate, and other certificate programs. </p><h3> 9.) Do they refinance student loans from my school and/or my degree program?</h3><p> <br/> Ask which schools are eligible for the refinancing product. Some banks don&rsquo;t lend to student loan borrowers who have attended for-profit private institutions, community colleges, and/or certificate programs.</p><h3> 10.) What type of support and customers service does the bank provide?</h3><p> <br/> At the Student Loan Hero office, this is the most important question we ask our banking partners. As student loan borrowers ourselves, we have worked with banks that provide terrible customer service, not to mention banks that are hostile and threatening.</p><p> Refinancing your student loans means that you will be working with this bank for the next 5-20 years.

{"original_id":2093,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Automation is Here to Stay in Wealth Management – Are You?","link":"automation-is-here-to-stay-in-wealth-management-are-you","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asmarterlook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   David Benskin  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.wealthaccess.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Wealth Access  </u> </a> For the past couple of decades, wealth management has been a pretty sleepy corner of the financial services industry.  Not much has changed in the process of delivering financial advice over the years, despite the fact that there have been seismic shifts in technologies, demographics and consumer demands during that same time frame.As financial advisors, we&rsquo;ve been able to pretty much navigate the last ten or fifteen years with a complicated story about the markets, peppered with some industry jargon, an excel spreadsheet or two, and a lucrative AUM fee.    Life was good.</p><h3> But, fortunately for some and unfortunately for others, those days are over.</h3>Wealth management today is being quickly and drastically re-written by new competition, technology advancements and a new generational view that &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to work with our father&rsquo;s advisor anymore.&rdquo;The cold hard facts are that according to Accenture, $30 trillion in wealth<u> <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a></u>is about to be transitioned to the next generation, yet according to Schwab Advisor Services, 84% of advisors<u> <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [2] </a></u>have no relationship with their current clients&rsquo; children.These are not good numbers for the typical financial advisor and point to some urgent changes advisors need to take to ensure they have a sustainable business going forward as clients continue to age, draw down their assets, and advisors&rsquo; business valuations with them.In order to stay relevant in this new world order, connect with the next generation of current clients and reinvigorate asset pipelines, advisors need to take a page out of the technology disruptors that have devastated other service industries by focusing on providing a better client experience through technology.A better client experience has been the calling card by which the big Internet players (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Uber &ndash; et al) used to gain exponential growth and bankrupt legacy industry participants.  Think travel agents, newspapers, magazines, book sellers, taxi drivers, photo developers, video rentals, music stores, retail businesses and more &ndash; all of whom didn&rsquo;t understand how consumers were changing in the way they wanted to engage with their providers via technology and were slow to react to automation&rsquo;s encroachment into their core businesses.When looked at through the lens of the robo-advisors currently targeting the wealth management industry today &ndash; and not just the annoying little guys, but the big firms like Schwab and Vanguard who have gathered billions of assets in a few weeks through their new robo platforms &ndash; and this pattern sounds very familiar.According to a study recently released by global consulting firm, Cap Gemini<u> <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [3] </a></u>, 64% of affluent individuals, including high net worth investors, expect their future wealth management relationship to be digital.  In that same study, 82% of affluent individuals, including high net worth investors, under the age of 40 expect digital wealth management interactions.   Additionally, 65% of affluent individuals, including high net worth investors, will leave their wealth management firm if an integrated channel experience is not provided.<h3> The evidence and inevitable trends documented here are hard to refute.</h3>So what can independent advisors do to not only survive, but also thrive from these changes?First, advisors need to admit to themselves that they can&rsquo;t keep on doing business the same way and need to begin to embrace new technologies.  Investors today don&rsquo;t want to meet with their advisor in person reviewing paper reports that are outdated the minute they were printed.  Investors today want to graphically see their entire balance sheet in one place on their mobile device to model the impact of what a trip to Tahiti will do to their retirement picture, while waiting for the waiter to deliver their drinks on a Saturday night.   If you don&rsquo;t provide this functionality to your high net worth clients, then they will find someone else who will.In order to respond to this new consumer demand, advisors need to start to incorporate the best of digital advisor technology to enhance the client experience and engage clients and prospects online and on their phones through advanced wealth management reporting and analyses.The good news is that there is a renaissance happening in advisor technology.  Advisors can take advantage of integrated, purpose built technology to be able to provide an interactive website and client portal with aggregated wealth views to engage clients online and on their phones, while bringing in operational efficiencies to lower costs so that advisors can compete in a world of &ldquo;free&rdquo; advice being offered by the big brands such as Schwab.All advisors have to do is take that first step and get started.  Wealth management is no longer that same sleepy corner of the industry anymore.<h3> Automation is here to stay; the question is &ndash; are you?</h3><a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1]</a><u> http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-CM-AWAMS-Wealth-Transfer-Final-June2012-Web-Version.pdf</u><a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [2]</a><u> <a href=\"http://advisorservices.schwab.com/public/file/P-7261440/GenNowResearchNarrative_MKT82931-00_final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://advisorservices.schwab.com/public/file/P-7261440/GenNowResearchNarrative_MKT82931-00_final.pdf </a></u><a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [3]</a><u> <a href=\"https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/self-service_in_wealth_management_whitepaper_2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://www.capgemini.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/self-service_in_wealth_management_whitepaper_2014.pdf </a></u> ","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-15 18:14:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-15 18:14:17.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_4waZ8Sn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/automation-is-here-to-stay-in-wealth-management-are-you/\", \"post_id\": \"4753\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-15 18:14:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-15 18:14:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"automation-is-here-to-stay-in-wealth-management-are-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4752\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2127\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436918894467-0845bb984853-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"737\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://www.digitalagent.com/advisors-avoid-this-costly-website-mistake-call-to-action/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437044400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

What is the primary goal for your website visitors? How are you directing your visitors to accomplish these goals? </strong> If the goal of your website is to create sales and get more business, then it is important that your <strong>  website has effective Call to Actions </strong> , otherwise known as CTA. A CTA is a button or link that you place on your website to drive prospective customers to become leads by filling out a form on a landing page.</p><p> One of the biggest most costly mistakes that we see on Financial Advisors websites is in their CTA, or lack thereof. <strong>  Without a call to action, your website cannot generate leads like it is intended to do. </strong> You could write the most compelling website copy, and it wouldn&rsquo;t amount to anything if a call to action wasn&rsquo;t clearly defined to capture that prospects information. A clear call to action will help to increase your profits by maximizing conversions and improving user experience. In effect, it is the next stage of your sales cycle.</p><p> An effective CTA provides:</p><li> Focus to your site</li><li> A way to measure your sites success</li><li> Direction to your visitors <br/>  </li><p> As an Advisor, present your services and start a conversation with people who need your help. Present your value and use calls to action to direct visitors to a contact form, a newsletter subscription, or other call to actions such as:</p><li> Download an E-book</li><li> Make an appointment</li><li> Free consultation</li><li> Interactive Tools</li><li> Webinars <br/>  </li><p> A call to action provides your visitor with direction and a number of different progression points. CTAs must be logical and related to the content on the page. For example, let&rsquo;s say you have a CTA that asks your visitor to &ldquo;Schedule an assessment of their RRSP investment mix&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s a logical path to that call to action? It could be, 1) Visitor enters by searching for some tips on effectively saving for retirement, 2) Visitor likes the article and decides to look at what your practice does with respect to Retirement Savings advice and 3) Visitor sees your call to action to schedule an assessment, clicks on it and submits their contact information (first name, last name, email, etc.). Think about what your calls to action will be and plan out the path for how you want your prospects to get there.</p><p> Not many people pick up the phone these days as a result of visiting a businesses website. This is why it is far better to have a softer call to action that allows you to communicate with your prospects on a regular basis.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-15 18:05:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-15 18:05:19.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_hoaVc45.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-avoid-this-costly-website-mistake/\", \"post_id\": \"4751\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-15 18:05:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-15 18:05:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-avoid-this-costly-website-mistake\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4750\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2126\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436918671239-a2b72ace4880-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"610\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://www.digitalagent.com/advisors-avoid-this-costly-website-mistake-call-to-action/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437043500,"author_id":268,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2091,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Secrets to a Successful Mentoring Program","link":"6-secrets-to-a-successful-mentoring-program","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Mentoring, at it&rsquo;s best, is a magical elixir which shaves years off your learning curve through mistakes unmade. Thank God, I&rsquo;ve experienced the transformational spirit of amazing mentors. Please God, let my mentoring have made a difference for others.</p><p> Ask anyone who&rsquo;s ever had an amazing mentor where that experience ranks in their growth as a leader, and I&rsquo;d bet money they&rsquo;d put their mentor ahead of any keynote, consulting program, book they&rsquo;ve read, and potentially their 80K MBA. I say that as a speaker, consultant, author, MBA professor, and someone who&rsquo;s had the fortunate experience of having a gaggle of amazing mentors over the last two decades.</p><p> Great mentorship is unscripted, raw, real, trusting, challenging and kind. Great mentorship is a two-way journey. It&rsquo;s so human it bleeds into other areas of your life.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve attended a funeral of a great mentor and felt like I&rsquo;ve lost my right arm. A dozen years later I still wonder what he would say when times are at the most difficult. I wasn&rsquo;t the only one in the room who felt that way.</p><p> Great mentors are rarely monogamous.</p><p> Sadly, few folks I know have experienced that mentor-induced pull toward becoming the leader they are meant to become.</p><p> When I ask my audiences how many of them have had a truly great mentor, it&rsquo;s surprisingly sad how few raise their hands. In my MBA courses, the number is even fewer. Sometimes no hand is raised. This is our future.</p><p> As a culture, we&rsquo;re not mentoring well.</p><p> I think we know this, which is why I receive so many calls asking for mentoring as a keynote topic. &ldquo;How do we do this better?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Who must we involve?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t this working?&rdquo; &ldquo;What about the &lsquo;millennial situation?'&rdquo;</p><p> So, prompted by another such conversation this afternoon, I&rsquo;m opening this conversation for our LGL Community. Here&rsquo;s what I think matters. I  hope you&rsquo;ll chime in.</p><h3> What Matters Most <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Establish Measurable Goals: </strong>  As Covey would say, begin with the end in mind. How will you know you&rsquo;re successful? Determine how you will measure success. I promise you, it&rsquo;s not just <br/> &ldquo;that folks feel better.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Pick the Right People: </strong>  If you&rsquo;re going to get into the business of match-making, do it well. Consider the value of  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/5-benefits-to-working-with-people-who-drive-you-crazy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nemesis  </a> </u>  mentors. What often works best is announcing the program, providing people with scaffolding to make their own matches, and then support.</li><li> <strong>  Get Them Started: </strong>  Ready, mentor, go! is seldom enough. Even your smartest, most creative types can get a little twitchy when asked to do something outside of their day job. I&rsquo;ve found a half-day kick off workshop including multiple mentoring relationships can go a long way in launching them toward success.</li><li> <strong>  Establish Parameters:  </strong> Guidelines are vital. If you&rsquo;re a mentor, does that mean you&rsquo;re signing up to be a sponsor? These are key conversations. I&rsquo;ve mentored a long list of folks I&rsquo;ve helped to improve, but I wouldn&rsquo;t put my brand on every one of their careers in support of the next promotion.</li><li> <strong>  Give Them Something To Do: </strong>  In every mentoring program I&rsquo;ve developed, I&rsquo;ve given them easy tools and activities to them started.

Here Are 4 Simple Steps To Get You Started","link":"not-investing-yet-here-are-4-simple-steps-to-get-you-started","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Close your eyes for a moment and envision where you&rsquo;d like to be in 30 or 40 years&hellip; Are you sailing to Tahiti? Writing that book? Running your vineyard? Building a new company?</p><p> If you had trouble envisioning where you&rsquo;d like to be, you&rsquo;re not alone. But unless you can visualize it, unless you&rsquo;ve got your destination planned, it can be hard to get there. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to start thinking about what your goals currently are &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s for yourself, your career, your startup, your art, and/or your family &ndash; and take the first &ndash; or the next &ndash; steps to invest in your future.</p><p> What does investing mean? Very simply, it means putting your money somewhere you expect it to grow. It can be traditional stocks, bonds and mutual funds, or real estate, collectibles, annuities, and other things that are expected to gain value over time.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re just starting out, thinking about &ndash; and setting aside money for &ndash; your future can feel like a challenge; when you&rsquo;ve just set up your first lemonade stand and barely breaking even, it&rsquo;s hard to think about re-investing part of your profits in lemon groves that will someday produce income for you.</p><p> The trick is to overcome inertia, get started, and make a commitment, even if it&rsquo;s just a tiny first step.</p><h3> Inertia is not your friend</h3><p> <br/> Inertia is one of the biggest reasons people waste opportunities to started investing when they&rsquo;re young.</p><p> <strong>  Objects at rest tend to stay at rest: </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re not investing yet, or if your money is sitting in a non-income producing bank account it can be hard to get started or get moving.</p><p> <strong>  Objects in motion tend to stay in motion: </strong></p><p> If your money is constantly in motion, if you&rsquo;re spending everything you make, or if your money is following the crowd to the next big glamour stock, it can be hard to slow down and take stock with a Financial Planner to build a solid foundation.</p><p> A study by Hewitt Associates found, for instance, that only 31% of employees in their 20s invest in their company&rsquo;s 401K plan&sup1;. That means almost 70% of young employees who could be investing in a matching 401k plan haven&rsquo;t started taking advantage of what is essentially free money. Whether inertia is keeping them from getting started, or inertia is keeping their money in motion so that there&rsquo;s none left over to invest, they are not only leaving free money on the table, they&rsquo;re not letting that money grow through compounding.</p><p> According to an article in US News and World Report, if you start investing just $100 a month in your 20s, increase contributions as your income increases, and make good financial decisions along the way, you are on your way to potentially retiring with over 1 million dollars.&sup2;</p><h3> How Do You Get Started?</h3><p> <br/> Here are four simple steps to get you past inertia and get you started.</p><li> <strong>  Find your motivation </strong></li><p> We are all passionate about certain things. The more you care, the more focused you are about achieving your goals. Make a list of the things that are important to you and the things you want to achieve.</p><li> <strong>  Find extra money </strong></li><p> There are only two ways to &ldquo;find&rdquo; money &ndash; spending less or making more. While it may seem daunting &ndash; inertia again! &ndash; you&rsquo;d be surprised by how easy it is to discover places you can cut back a little or spend a little less. And, while you have a lot more control over your spending than your earnings, you can also look for ways to find extra sources of income, work more hours, or even get a better paying job.</p><li> <strong>  Move financial goals up </strong></li><p> If you plan to save &ldquo;whatever you have left&rdquo; or &ldquo;whatever you&rsquo;ve saved&rdquo; at the end of each month, don&rsquo;t be surprised by how little that actually is. We all have a tendency to spend what we have, and spend more as our income goes up. You can avoid that pitfall by paying yourself first. When you prioritize saving in your budget and take that money &ldquo;out of circulation,&rdquo; your spending will fall in line.</p><li> <strong>  Get advice from an adviser you trust </strong></li><p> The world of finance and investing can be complicated and confusing. Don&rsquo;t let fear of the unknown keep you from getting started. You don&rsquo;t need a large amount of savings to meet with an adviser who can answer a lot of your questions. Getting a roadmap from someone who knows the territory will help you get started and may allow for a smoother journey.</p><p> Investing in your future is an investment in yourself. If you take these four simple steps, even with limited assets, you&rsquo;ll be laying the foundation for a lifetime of investing in your own plans and goals, and your own vision of financial freedom.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-15 17:54:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-15 17:54:14.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_WU757BM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/not-investing-yet-here-are-4-simple-steps-to-get-you-started/\", \"post_id\": \"4747\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-15 17:54:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-15 17:54:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"not-investing-yet-here-are-4-simple-steps-to-get-you-started\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4746\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2124\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Why-and-How-to-Start-Investing-Today2-740x480.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"464\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437069600,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2089,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Leverage Your Wins in the Financial Services Industry","link":"how-to-leverage-your-wins-in-the-financial-services-industry","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KCDPR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   KCD  </a>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KCDPR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Public Relations  </a> </u></p><p> Halfway through 2015 we continue to see a rebounding and growing economy, unemployment rates as low as 5.9 percent and increased employment opportunities, specifically in the professional and financial services industries. This last year, financial advisors continued to evolve, finding innovative ways to leverage technology and social media marketing, while trying to keep ahead of industry trends.</p><p> Whether you find yourself working as a part of a recruiting team for a large broker-dealer or custodian or a venture capitalist looking to close your next big deal, it&rsquo;s increasingly important that branding, marketing and external promotion are used to showcase your firm&rsquo;s value to prospects. If not, no one will learn of your success as most prospects use the web as their main way to research.</p><h3> First Things First</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Did you know that 70% of a buyer&rsquo;s decision process is complete before they contact or engage with a potential business? </strong></p><p> <strong>  What influences the remaining 30% of the prospect&rsquo;s buyer journey? </strong></p><p> As technology evolves and people are bombarded with messages from every direction, having a powerful identity as a firm looking to recruit top talent is key to cutting through the noise. Creating and maintaining your company brand will be an essential part of your success. This means establishing a cohesive look and feel for your website, social media pages and communications with the public. Utilizing marketing for recruiters is a fundamental part of your success so ask yourself the following questions when developing an effective brand and determining how to position your identity in the marketplace:</p><p> 1. What makes you special? Why should a quality financial professional choose you? What does your company offer that differs from everyone else?</p><p> 2. What will the prospect&rsquo;s experience look like?</p><p> 3. When a potential prospect hears your name, what three words do you want them to think of?</p><h3> Your Content Should Reflect Your Vision</h3><p> <br/> While you&rsquo;re busy hunting for &ldquo;right fit&rdquo; financial professionals, you may be missing out on the best opportunities. For example, financial advisors may not feel comfortable volunteering that they are looking to change firms. In fact, they may not even know that transitioning is the right move. By offering your knowledge and promoting a growth oriented message, you increase your digital presence, demonstrate your value and knowledge of the industry, and begin to establish a rapport. The hard part is over! Now that you&rsquo;re in front of your target audience, take the opportunity to appeal to their emotions by communicating your understanding of their pain points. Show empathy, educate your prospects, demonstrate your value and establish yourself as a thought leader in the industry.</p><h3> Success Requires Momentum</h3><p> <br/> Establishing your brand and creating powerful content isn&rsquo;t the end of the road. If you are already effectively recruiting quality producers, how are you making those wins count? Solidify your position as an indispensable resource for new candidates by becoming impossible to ignore. Prospects now have access to as much information about your company as you do about them as a prospect, so if you aren&rsquo;t easy to find, you may not seem relevant. Some non-negotiables for establishing and maintaining your brand online are:</p><li> Make sure your website is functional, modern and consistent with your brand. From the language used to the over-all aesthetics, it should be simple, straight forward and consistent with your brand&rsquo;s messaging. For many potential recruits, this will be your first chance to tell your story and it is imperative to make a good impression. Showcase your value, highlight your successes and make it easy for them to see what makes you the best.</li><li> Optimize for mobile. Currently, only 13 percent of Fortune 500 corporations have a &ldquo;mobile career website,&rdquo; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not necessary. Recent data shows 62 percent of job seekers currently use their mobile device(s) at least once a week for job searching. By optimizing your website for mobile, not only are you positioning your brand exactly where recruits are looking, but you are putting your value in the palm of their hand.</li><li> Be present on major forms of social media. Having a branded company page on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn is a must!</li><li> Don&rsquo;t just create your Social Media accounts, use them! Engage with your audience and continue to build rapport with them. Encourage candidates and peers to engage with you as well. Social media is meant to establish a community, so it is important to maintain a consistent presence.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to promote. Share your wins, successes and testimonials with your followers. You&rsquo;ve earned them! Not only will this engage your audience, but it will also continue to solidify your reputation as a trusted resource and viable option for other potential candidates. <br/>  </li><p> With a strong brand, quality content and consistent engagement, marketing can become an indispensable factor in your recruiting efforts and the overall growth of your business. You&rsquo;ve fine-tuned your practice and closed top producers, now it&rsquo;s time to leverage those successes and help future recruits find you.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-15 17:50:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-15 17:50:18.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_MRPx2JQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-leverage-your-wins-in-the-financial-services-industry/\", \"post_id\": \"4745\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-15 17:50:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-15 17:50:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-leverage-your-wins-in-the-financial-services-industry\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4744\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2123\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/womens-world-cup-usa-trophy-lift-abby-wambach-video.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"814\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437062400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2088,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Surefire Ways To Break Bad Habits","link":"5-surefire-ways-to-break-bad-habits","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My training helped me to develop the self-control I would need to do my job professionally, even when provoked, by staying calm and not reacting with anger in hostile situations.</p><p> Self-control separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Rather than responding to immediate impulses, self-control is the ability to act the way we want to act when we find ourselves in challenging situations.</p><p> When we&rsquo;re stressed, we tend to rely on ingrained habits&mdash;whether they are helpful or harmful. To manage ourselves well, it&rsquo;s important to know our habits well enough that we&rsquo;re not surprised by our reactions when we hit tough times.</p><p> This is surprisingly difficult because our habits are, for the most part, invisible and hidden in our unconscious mind. For example: you get into your car and drive to work without thinking about it&mdash;you operate on autopilot. Autopilot habits allow us to live on low brain-strain.</p><p> We don&rsquo;t need to pay conscious attention to the countless habits that keep us going from day to day. The brain conserves energy this way and makes us more efficient. The problem is accessing this part of the brain when we become aware that our habits are no longer working in our best interests.</p><p> Mental toughness is managing our emotions, thoughts, and behavior in ways that will set us up for success. This requires self-control as well as emotional awareness if we are to know which habits need to be strengthened, changed, or jettisoned.</p><p> Here are 5 surefire ways to break bad habits:</p><h3> 1. Change The Way You Think About Habits</h3><p> <br/> If you want to develop good habits, it takes willpower.</p><p> In his book, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength-ebook/dp/B0052REQCY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436633761&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=willpower&amp;pebp=1436633765245&amp;perid=1N1J9Z471FW1Z7YT5CS8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; social psychologist Roy Baumeister concludes that willpower is limited and depends on a continuous supply of glucose to power the brain.</p><p> For years we&rsquo;ve been told that willpower is needed for sprints&mdash;but that it will not last for the entire run.</p><p> Now, this claim is being challenged by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/opinion/sunday/willpower-its-in-your-head.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Stanford psychologists Greg Walton and Carol Dweck  </a> </u> .</p><p> They believe that willpower can indeed be quite limited&mdash;but only if you believe it is. On the other hand, if you believe that willpower is self-renewing&mdash;then you will successfully exert more willpower.</p><p> If you believe you have the willpower to keep going, it is not a limited resource.</p><h3> 2. Identify The Triggers</h3><p> <br/> When we are stressed, bad habits can be triggered.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t know what your triggers are, you will never succeed in changing bad habits. In moments of frustration and vulnerability, we often reach for alcohol, drugs, or food. Likewise, boredom, anxiety, and anger can trigger a bad habit that we&rsquo;ve developed over the years as a way of coping with those negative emotions.</p><p> It is essential to identify the state of mind that triggers your undesirable habit.</p><h3> 3. Eliminate Choices</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t put yourself in temptation&rsquo;s way.</p><p> If you love chocolate, stop buying it so it&rsquo;s not in your kitchen. Make a plan ahead of time for how you will not succumb to the temptation.</p><p> If you want to control impulse spending, stop carrying a credit card with you. This will force you to rethink the purchase. If the item is over a specific amount, talk it over with someone else. Chances are good that you&rsquo;ll think twice about making the purchase.</p><p> Willpower is all you need to make sure you stick with it! If you are motivated, you can make a list of the good habits you want to incorporate into your lifestyle and prioritize them.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Baumeister\" target=\"_blank\">   Baumeister  </a> </u>  states that &ldquo;People with low willpower use it to get themselves out of a crisis. People with high willpower use it to not get themselves into a crisis in the first place.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. Notice The Way The Habit Operates</h3><p> <br/> Simply put&mdash;pay attention!</p><p> Notice not only the factors that trigger the bad habit, but also become aware of the behavior that leads up to your habit.</p><p> For example, let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;ve had a bad day at work. You know that you act out your frustration in aggressive driving behavior on the way home. So, instead of letting a white BWM into your lane, you stomp on the gas pedal and almost cause a collision.</p><p> You experience a sense of satisfaction at having made someone else&rsquo;s day miserable. It feels good at first, then it feels bad. But the next time you have a bad day at work, the habit starts all over again.</p><h3> 5. Reward Yourself</h3><p> <br/> Many of us develop bad habits because they make us feel good!</p><p> Once you have the urge to indulge in a bad habit, experiment by doing something different instead. What you choose isn&rsquo;t important.

{"original_id":2087,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Sleep Apps 101","link":"sleep-apps-101","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Thanks in part to the internet, we have become more aware of the many benefits of a good night&rsquo;s sleep. The positive benefits range from improved cognitive function and mood to better cardiovascular and metabolic health. Because of these pluses, there has been a flood of devices purporting to help us achieve this goal. Many, if not most, are available on our smart phones. Before you rush into them, I think you should be aware of some of the following facts.</p><h3> The majority of apps that attempt to tell you whether you are asleep or awake are accelerometers.</h3><p> <br/> They detect movement and correlate its presence with being awake and its absence with being asleep. Accelerometers are somewhat accurate, although they do tend to misidentify wakefulness as sleep and thus may overestimate your sleep time, as was demonstrated in the only study using simultaneous in-lab polysomnography.</p><p> There are a number of apps that claim to tell you the quality of your sleep, alleging the ability to be able to differentiate lighter and deeper stages of sleep. However, in many studies, the most sophisticated medical accelerometers called actigraphs have been tested under stringently controlled conditions. Unfortunately, there has never been a study that could demonstrate the capability to differentiate light vs. deep sleep. As a sleep specialist who interprets sleep studies every day, I can tell you that the degree of movement between lighter stages of sleep, deep sleep, and dream sleep is very subtle and it is the accompanying brain wave patterns that are necessary to make this determination accurately. Therefore, at this time, until there are independent studies to verify this, I would be very wary of these claims.</p><p> Other apps available appear to be useful in inducing and maintaining sleep. Pink noise is a blend of high and low frequencies that produces an entrancing waterfall effect. It has been shown to decrease the time it takes to fall asleep and produce more stable sleep.</p><p> Binaural beats is found in another app. This is a method of using sounds of different frequencies to produce what is called brain synchronization. In this method, two sound waves of different frequencies are introduced into each ear. The waves of similar frequency are cancelled out by the brain, thus leaving the difference between the two. If the difference is in the low frequencies, characteristic of sleep, some studies have shown that the brain can become synchronized with these frequencies and enter into sleep.</p><p> Finally, there are apps that utilize techniques such as meditation, guided imagery, muscle relaxation, and even hypnosis to help you get to sleep. I think these can be quite useful. However, keep in mind that for these to work you need to combine them with good sleep hygiene. If you are on the computer or texting right up until bedtime or consuming caffeine too close to bedtime, it is unlikely any of these will be effective for long.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-15 15:37:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-15 15:37:39.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_X4QR3TX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/sleep-apps-101/\", \"post_id\": \"4741\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-15 15:37:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-15 15:37:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"sleep-apps-101\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4740\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2121\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-15-at-8.36.48-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"452\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1437066000,"author_id":157,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2085,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Ways LinkedIn Can Replace Cold Calling","link":"4-ways-linkedin-can-replace-cold-calling","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Alex PirouzFor decades, sales professionals and business owners have been playing the numbers game when making cold calls.They have picked up the phone, called hundreds of people, and depending on their skill set converted a percentage of their conversations into leads, and those leads into sales.Now enter the age of social media and the Internet. The prospecting world has changed. Customers are doing more research and are not as responsive to cold calls as they were in the past.In fact, studies show that in 2007 it took only 3.68 call attempts to reach a prospect and in 2015 it takes 8 attempts.In addition, 2% of cold calls result in an appointment and in large deals, there are typically 7 decision-makers involved in the process. <strong>  Seems like a costly and time-consuming way to acquire new business. </strong> Businesses who are successful in their lead generation efforts are adopting Internet marketing strategies and leveraging the social media.They are focusing on inbound marketing and utilizing other platforms to generate leads for their business.Since a majority of LinkedIn users are professionals and 49% of them are key decision makers, it makes sense to turn to LinkedIn first for new lead prospecting.During our  <u>  <a href=\"https://ly178.isrefer.com/go/linkedinmastery/alexpirouz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FREE LinkedIn training sessions  </a> </u> , clients are constantly asking me how they can use LinkedIn as a lead generation tool. There has never been a better time than now to learn how!</p><h3> So Could LinkedIn be the platform to Replace Cold Calling?</h3>We think so. Not only is LinkedIn the go-to platform for professionals, the site has also ramped up their platform to support lead generation activities that fit sales professionals, business owners and marketing managers.What if you could use LinkedIn for your inbound lead generation? And forget cold calling altogether? Below are the top LinkedIn tools that can help you do exactly that.<h3> 1) Advanced Search</h3>The advanced search tool is the best way to find names of potential prospects in companies that you are targeting.For years, companies have been paying thousands of dollars a month to have inside access to contact information, that now you can access for the cost of your LinkedIn membership.<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Advanced-Search.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"LinkedIn Advanced Search Criteria\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Advanced-Search.png\"/>   </a>The Advanced Search tool is very simple to use. You can find prospects by using:<li> Keywords</li><li> Company names</li><li> Job titles</li><li> Location</li><li> Industry</li>And other factors depending upon your subscription. Simply type in the information you are seeking, press submit, and LinkedIn will generate a comprehensive list of profiles you can start connecting too.<h3> 2) Direct Messaging</h3>Instead of email, direct messaging your contacts gives you a greater chance of your message being read and responded to. Clients and customers receive tons of email per day, but only a few LinkedIn messages.It is very easy to stand out from the crowd using this feature. Next time you are tempted to send a prospecting email, try direct messaging through LinkedIn instead.Please note, this feature is only available if you are a connection of theirs.If you would like to know how to use this feature, jump on our upcoming <u> <a href=\"https://ly178.isrefer.com/go/linkedinmastery/alexpirouz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  FREE LinkedIn Training Session </a></u> where you will learn the 4-step email marketing process we use to turn connections into meaningful relationships.<h3> <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inbox-LinkedIn.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"LinkedIn Send Message box\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inbox-LinkedIn.png\"/> </a> 3) LinkedIn Publishing Feature</h3>Another great way to attract potential clients and customers is to provide engaging and educational content. LinkedIn has designed their entire platform to support the sharing of value-added resources that can benefit the end-user.With newly integrated analytic features, you can now view every person who has shared or commented on your article. What better way to capture a warm lead than reach out to someone who has just received value from information you posted?<h3> <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Analytics.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"LinkedIn Users Demographics\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Analytics.png\"/> </a> 4) Who's Viewed Your Profile</h3>And finally, if you have a premium subscription, you can view every single person who has viewed your profile! What better way to identify potential prospects than seeing who has checked out your profile?Once you have looked at their profile, if they seem like a good contact, write a simple message to strike up a business conversation on the phone or a coffee in person. You never know, it may book you some solid business!<h3> <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Whos-viewed-your-profile.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"LinkedIn Who's Viewed Your Profile\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Whos-viewed-your-profile.png\"/> </a></h3><h3> Adopting New Practices</h3>The way we do business has changed. Customers are more educated on the services they need, there are more influencers and decision-makers than ever before, and cold calling is becoming less and less effective. Somewhat dead in my opinion!!!To survive in today&rsquo;s marketplace it&rsquo;s essential for you to adopt new practices and embrace the new world of social media.Using LinkedIn tools such as Advanced Search, Direct Messaging, the LinkedIn publishing feature, and Who&rsquo;s Viewed your Profile tool, you could turn your approach from a &ldquo;push&rdquo; sales method to an inbound selling approach.This way, you can say goodbye to Cold Calling and hello to LinkedIn as a way to warm up your leads into valuable, offline conversations.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-14 19:30:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-14 19:30:08.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_p0cpODq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-ways-linkedin-can-replace-cold-calling/\", \"post_id\": \"4737\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-14 19:30:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-14 19:30:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-ways-linkedin-can-replace-cold-calling\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4736\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2119\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cold-calling.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2058\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436987700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2084,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Ways to Make Your Next Recognition Stand Out","link":"5-ways-to-make-your-next-recognition-stand-out","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoySaunderson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Roy Saunderson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://rideau.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Rideau  </u> </a>  </p><p> Let&rsquo;s stop doing the trite and tried and true acts of recognition giving. Get out of the boring recognition ruts and make your next recognition experience a stand out occasion.</p><p> Read, ponder, and do the following:</p><p> <strong>  1. The recognition you plan to give has to be a total surprise. </strong>  When you get recognition right it is the most fun and thrilling thing to do for someone else. Recognition should be a surprise and never expected. Rewards are earned and naturally anticipated. You can make your recognition stand out simply by not letting the cat out of the bag ahead of time. Surprise them!</p><p> <strong>  2. Give recognition from your heart and not from your pocketbook. </strong>  Recognition is a relationship-based skill. The more positive relationship you have between one person and another the more meaningful recognition will be between you. Not a good relationship? Then the recognition won&rsquo;t be good either. Share your feelings about what they did using great adjectives to express your recognition to them. Emote recognition!</p><p> <strong>  3. Think how you can make recognition special in some small way. </strong>  It can seem clich&eacute; to say, it&rsquo;s the little things that count. But, guess what? It is the little things that count. Know your staff inside out from demographic to psychographic details. And then demonstrate your genuine caring by the note card you buy to thank them; or perhaps it is a small, but uniquely personal, item you find as a token of appreciation.  Special care!</p><p> <strong>  4. Connect whatever they&rsquo;ve done to the contribution they&rsquo;ve made.  </strong> We all want to make a difference in our work but not many of us actually experience that. If some action or result merits being acknowledged then some contribution has been made by the recognition recipient. They can&rsquo;t always see what they&rsquo;ve really done. So tell them. Tell them specifically how their contribution has made a difference to you, a customer, a team or the company. Contribution connection!</p><p> <strong>  5. Deliver recognition in such a way that both of you feel it emotionally. </strong>  I&rsquo;m not talking about having a sappy, tears in the eyes experience every time you express appreciation to someone.

Specifically he and his fellow monks ran 40 kilometers a day for 100 days. Yes, you read that right. 40 kilometers per day! They did this for 5 years. They are called the Gyoja, or marathon monks and they do the impossible.</p><li> For the first 5 years they run 100 days, 40 kilometers each day</li><li> The 6th year, they run 100 days, 60 kilometers each day</li><li> The 7th year, they run 84 kilometers per day for 100 days and then do another 100 days where they run 40 kilometers each day. <br/>  </li><p> Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. During the 5th year of the 1,000 day marathon, they have to go 7.5 days without food, water or rest.</p><p> From 1885 to 1988 only 46 men have completed the 1,000 day marathon.</p><p> These monks dare to do the impossible. They dare to push themselves to the extreme. They dare to be great.</p><h3> Do you want to be great?</h3><p> <br/> I hope you answered yes. In fact, if you didn&rsquo;t answer with a resounding yes and a mental fist pump then it&rsquo;s time for me to give you a pep talk:</p><p> <strong>  Dare to be great. Greatness doesn&rsquo;t have to be fame or power. It&rsquo;s time for you to define your greatness. Be a great parent. Be a great employee. Be a great leader. Be a great lover. Don&rsquo;t just be. Be great. </strong></p><p> Have I convinced you?</p><p> No? If you are satisfied with life and don&rsquo;t feel the need to be great then, I&rsquo;m going to be blunt:</p><p> <strong>  Stop reading this post. Go watch Netflix or skim Facebook. This post is for those of you who know you have a greater calling and are willing to work for it. </strong></p><p> Yes? Do you want to do something bigger than you? Do you want to be a top performer in your field? Good. Now let&rsquo;s get down to business:</p><p> These are the questions we answer in this post:</p><li> What are the patterns of top performers?</li><li> What do great people have in common?</li><li> How can you be great? <br/>  </li><p> I chose the book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/05/elite-minds-creating-the-competitive-advantage/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Elite Minds by Dr. Stan Beecham  </a> </u>  for our Science of People book club and learned how great minds think differently. I was pretty blown away by his perspective and wanted to summarize my favorite points and take-aways from his book for you.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the Big Idea:</p><p> &ldquo;When you truly study top performers in any field, what sets them apart is not their physical skill; it is how they control their minds.&rdquo; &ndash;Stan Beecham</p><p> <strong>  WARNING: </strong>  If at anytime while reading this post you say to yourself the following:</p><li> I&rsquo;ve heard this before.</li><li> This won&rsquo;t work for me. <br/>  </li><p> Then it&rsquo;s time to go back to square one. Are you sure you really want to be great? Great people hear these thoughts and flip them on their head. They reframe with these mental challenges:</p><li> I&rsquo;ve heard this before. Why didn&rsquo;t I listen the first time? If I&rsquo;m hearing it again, it must be important.</li><li> I&rsquo;m going to find a way to make this work for me. <br/>  </li><h3> #1: The Power of Possibility</h3><p> <br/> On May 1st, 2010 Galen Rupp announced he was poised to break the American Record for fastest man during the 10,000 meter race. Not only did he break the record that night, but his competitor, Chris Solinsky also broke the record. The Canadian record was also broken that night by Simon Bairu. Why did all of these men break records and set their own personal best times? Because the moment Rupp announced he could break the record&ndash; breaking the record became a possibility.</p><p> What&rsquo;s possible for you? How fast do you think you can run? How high can you jump? How far can you take your dreams? The answer to this question defines the parameters to your success. What you think is possible, is possible.</p><h3> #2: Autopilot Kills Success</h3><p> <br/> Most of us are like the runners who wait for someone else to break a record. We live our life on autopilot and set our potential to the benchmarks of others. We think:</p><li> &ldquo;If no one else has done it, how could I?&rdquo;</li><li> Or, &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been done before, it&rsquo;s probably not possible.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> What have you been told is not possible about your dreams? How do you expect your performance to be? Understanding the unconscious expectations that are driving your actions is essential for success. Beecham says that this is one of the most important differentiators between top performers and stragglers:</p><p> &ldquo;If I was to summarize the primary difference between elite competitors and those who are not, it is that competitors make it their business to understand and manage their unconscious mind by mastering the conscious thoughts and behavior.&rdquo; &ndash; Beecham</p><h3> #3: Are You Lucky?</h3><p> <br/> Now it&rsquo;s time to question your unconscious expectations. Top performers believe they are lucky&mdash;they believe in the power of possibilities. And this belief radically changes their success. Why? Their expectation of luck changes their behavior and how they see opportunities.</p><p> &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t luck that determines your success&mdash;its expectation.&rdquo; &ndash;Dr. Beecham</p><p> One of my favorite stories of the entire book is one Beecham shares about his daughter. Beecham&rsquo;s daughter was about to run a track race with her school team. The morning of the race Beecham handed his daughter some new athletic socks and told her, &ldquo;Try these new socks. I bet you run at least a minute faster than you normally do if you wear the socks and your legs will feel lighter and fresher.&rdquo; That day she went on to run the fastest race of her life and broke a 19-minute barrier in a 5K cross country event for the first time ever.</p><p> Her expectation changed her outcome.</p><h3> #4: The Biology of Belief</h3><p> <br/> Our expectations of possibility are so powerful that they change our physiology. Beecham puts forward this mind-blowing maxim:</p><p> <strong>  Beliefs control biology, biology controls behavior, and behavior determines success. </strong></p><p> In other words, your mind is your most important asset&mdash;it can drive you to be a top performer or not. While most of the time athletes and professionals focus on physical training or technical skills, Beecham argues that your mind is what matters most for success.</p><li> The simple explanation: Our thoughts shape our mind.</li><li> The science-y explanation: &ldquo;Modern physics has demonstrated that matter and energy are the same. We think of the mind of energy in the body as matter, but quantum physics has taught us that matter is made up of energy. A piece of steel is essentially energy that is being held very tightly together. Thoughts (the brain&rsquo;s energy) directly impact the physical brain, which, in turn, controls the functions of the body. Through modern science, we now know that thought energy can activate or inhibit physical functionality on a cellular level.&rdquo; -Beecham <br/>  </li><h3> #5: Expectation Assimilation</h3><p> <br/> Expectation assimilation is the fancy science term for how our brain and body match and fulfill our expectations. A great example of the power of our mindset is with Tubby Smith.</p><p> Tubby Smith is the former basketball coach at the University of Georgia. Beecham found that his athletes were not getting injured at the same rate as other athletes and he wanted to know why. He went to Tubby and asked him what his team was doing differently. Here is what Tubby said:</p><p> &ldquo;I tell my team we are not going to get injured. We will do the things we need to do to prevent injury, we will warm up before practice and do some exercises to keep strong, so we will simply not get injured.&rdquo;</p><p> As a great coach, Tubby Smith formatted his athletes&rsquo; expectations around injury and shaped their actions and physiology.</p><h3> #6: Mental Handicapping</h3><p> <br/> While positive expectations can increase our success, negative expectations can harm it. This is called a nocebo (the opposite of placebo).</p><p> Nocebo is a term coined in 1961 by Walter Kennedy, which in Latin means &ldquo;I will harm.&rdquo; If you believe something will have a negative effect, it probably will. Having an elite mind isn&rsquo;t just about raising your expectations, it&rsquo;s also about eliminating your harmful expectations. Take a moment to try to identify your nocebos:</p><li> Do you see your failures and mistakes as one-time events or patterns?</li><li> What is your greatest weakness? Is it permanent?</li><li> What&rsquo;s holding you back? What are you doing about it? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Remember: </strong>  Increased self-awareness leads to improved performance. Seek out difficult emotional knowledge while your competitors avoid them and pretend they aren&rsquo;t there.</p><h3> #7: Excuses Are for Suckers</h3><p> <br/> What excuses are you making for your success? The Gyoja monks achieve the seemingly impossible because they get rid of excuses and double down:</p><li> They commit.</li><li> They have a clear goal. <br/>  </li><p> Great achievers hustle and don&rsquo;t tolerate excuses. In the words of Abraham Lincoln:</p><p> <u>  &ldquo;Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.&rdquo; -Abraham Lincoln </u>    </p><h3> #8: Perfect is the Enemy of Success</h3><p> <br/> Top performers don&rsquo;t do things perfectly, they do things purposefully. Perfect is an excuse in costume. Beecham found that elite minds shift the focus from perfect to learning. Here&rsquo;s how:</p><li> At the end of each day, ask yourself this question  <strong>  &ldquo;Was that the best I could do?&rdquo; </strong> <br/>  </li><p> No matter who you are or how successful you have become you will have bad days, you will make mistakes and you will have hurdles. Expect these, learn from them and move on.</p><h3> #9: Dream Big</h3><p> <br/> Goals that are not frightening are not worth having. Think about your goals and dreams. Are they big enough? What are the chances you will achieve them? Dr. Beecham argues that we should have dreams that we think have a 60% chance of success&ndash;that 40% chance of failure really lights a fire under your butt!</p><p> Why is this important? Fear gets your full attention. So re-look at your goals and set them so that you are only 60% sure you can achieve them.</p><h3> #10: Your Competitors Are Your Friends</h3><p> <br/> Competitors can help you, they can fuel you and they can inspire you. A great competitor raises your expectations, shatters your idea of what is possible and sets the bar higher. Being a top performer means that you use your competitors to help you run faster, not to hinder you. Reframe your competitors so that you see them as cheerleaders. The person in front of you is simply showing you what is possible. They are saying, &ldquo;You can do this!&rdquo;</p><p> Remember: Your competitors are afraid too. No one is better or faster than you&mdash;only less afraid.</p><h3> Final Point:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;If you plan on being anything less than you&rsquo;re capable of being you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life.&rdquo; &ndash;Abraham Maslow</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-14 18:58:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-14 18:58:17.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_0A2vVb5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-be-great/\", \"post_id\": \"4731\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-14 18:58:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-14 18:58:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-be-great\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4730\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2116\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436390344952-745d96c0c363-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"718\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436963400,"author_id":498,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2082,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Just Let It Go: Outsource the Day-to-Day and Focus on Your Mission","link":"just-let-it-go-outsource-the-day-to-day-and-focus-on-your-mission","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIJohnA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Anderson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIAdvisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SEI  </u> </a></p><p> This article originally appeared on the SEI  <u>  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Practically Speaking  </a> </u>  site.</p><p> If you are a financial services business owner, you juggle multiple tasks everyday &ndash; from marketing, investments, planning and more. I believe success really comes down to how we manage our time and resources. Every day we have to ask ourselves, &ldquo;what is the best way for me to spend my time?&rdquo;</p><p> Everybody has their &ldquo;go to&rdquo; stories. I&rsquo;ve told the story of the purchase of my home for over 14 years: the long months of fruitless searching and the nightmare closing on our home after a move from Chicago to Philly. I remember finally pulling into the driveway of a house that was like nothing that we had pictured or discussed to our real estate agent. I distinctly remember uttering these three sentences in this order:</p><li> I love it</li><li> We don&rsquo;t even have to go inside</li><li> I am never mowing that lawn <br/>  </li><p> Recently, I was boring yet another houseguest with that story, and it occurred to me that I&rsquo;m actually practicing something with my lawn care that I preach to my advisors; the value of outsourcing and the best use of their professional time. It works in daily life as well as well as in our businesses.</p><p> Outsourcing the mowing of that yard gives me more time to spend enjoying the home and my family. Most of us can mow our own lawns. The question is, should we? I think this is absolutely relative to an advisor&rsquo;s business. Just because you can do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean it serves you to do it.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s your time worth to your business?</h3><p> <br/> As a financial services business owner, you are chief marketing, operations, investments, planning and service officers rolled into one. Larger firms may have more people, but the owner(s) of the firm still has the ultimate responsibility for the delivery and the brand.</p><p> If we have staff, we have to allocate their time to maximize their value to our business. Do we do the same for ourselves? I look at study after study on how advisors really do allocate their time, and I wonder how many of them think about it like that.</p><h3> The true cost of doing it yourself</h3><p> <br/> One survey, &ldquo;Advisor Metrics 2014: Capitalizing on Transitions and Consolidation&rdquo; by Cerulli*, suggested that advisors spent almost 20% of their time dealing with back office/operations, trading and asset management, research and due diligence. That is 7 hours in a 35 hour work week (based on my experience, I believe that number is a bit low, but let&rsquo;s go with that number).  What does that mean for my business?  For a firm with $500K in revenue, that is an opportunity cost of $2,002 per week base on your  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/practice-efficiency/advisors-get-bigger-by-getting-smaller/?cmpid=ADV-BL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   hourly rate of $286 per hour  </u>    </a> or $96,096 per year!</p><p> If I am spending almost 20% of my gross revenue doing something, I&rsquo;d better be doing a phenomenal job&mdash;better  than anyone else&mdash; and my clients must truly value it above almost anything that I do.</p><p> When the lawn service comes to mow the lawn, I know that I could do just as good of a job but the key for me isn&rsquo;t that they do it better. They only have to do it as well as me to make outsourcing worthwhile. I would spend three hours doing what they will do in one. Based on my hourly rate, the cost is only a small fraction of what it would cost me to do myself. I can direct those resources elsewhere.</p><h3> That $96K can change your business</h3><p> <br/> Think about the key functions that you offer in your business.  Are there things that you have to do, even though the client doesn&rsquo;t place the same value on them that you do? Things that a qualified outsource provider could do just as well for less cost? One obvious answer is investment management. As we have discussed in the past, the value hub of an advisor&rsquo;s office is in the planning and the consultation, not the products.</p><p> What else could you do with $96,000 a year in savings? Could you:</p><li> <strong>  Give yourself more time with your clients? </strong>  Managing portfolios and operations take time. If you got rid some of the day-to-day non-revenue generating tasks, could you free your time and capacity to service more of your clients (and service them better)? Could you build a service model that will &ldquo;wow&rdquo; them?</li><li> <strong>  Build a more scalable (and sellable) business? </strong>  Without a doubt, the more your business is dependent on key people, and focused on investments, the lower the multiple will be when it&rsquo;s time to monetize your practice. Outsourcing allows a new buyer to step into your shoes with limited client disruption in philosophy or implementation.</li><li> <strong>  Build a deeper bench </strong> &mdash;without paying for it? Today the world is more complicated and confusing than ever.  You can&rsquo;t be an expert in everything, so choose to be an expert in the client. When the clients come to you for advice, you can leverage a platform provider&rsquo;s greater resources and tools to communicate and educate.</li><li> <strong>  Grow? </strong>  That same Cerulli study suggested that advisors only spend 15% of their time focused on growth related activities. What would your business look like if you spent double that meeting with prospects? <br/>  </li><p> Robert (our lawn care guy) does a great job in his business.  He can do it cheaper, and every Friday it looks just as good as if I would do it.</p><p> When you think about your business, some investments and operational functions are the same type of task. They have to get done. Can those tasks be commoditized?</p><p> If you could re-direct $96K a year in your business, how would you invest it? By putting it into an area that everyone already provides the clients?

The 3.5-hour halt in trading on the NYSE also added to investors&rsquo; unease.</p><p> Last week  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/in-the-news/oil-and-the-canadian-dollar-are-marching-in-tandem/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   on BNN TV  </a> </u> , Canada&rsquo;s leading business station, I explained that an important forward-looking economic indicator we closely monitor at U.S. Global Investors can help make sense of this slowdown: the global manufacturing purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI), which  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/8-trillion-alternative-energy-boom-is-a-win-for-copper/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   we've written about  </a> </u>  many times. Coupled with this, our portfolio managers recognize that during highly volatile markets adjusting cash levels in our funds is key.</p><p> In addition to our own macro models, BCA Research , a highly respected independent research company, pointed out that PMIs in developing economies have plunged to new lows.  The International Monetary Fund also  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-sees-2015-global-economic-growth-at-weakest-rate-since-financial-crisis-1436446905\" target=\"_blank\">   revised downward  </a> </u>  its global growth forecast for 2015. On this account, bad news is good news, as central bankers are scrambling to stimulate economic growth.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-Emerging-Markets-Manufacturing-PMI-is-Plunging-07102015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Emerging Markets Manufacturing PMI is Plunging\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-Emerging-Markets-Manufacturing-PMI-is-Plunging-07102015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> As active managers, we have raised our cash levels looking for opportunities in a sloppy market, particularly in our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/china-region-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   China Region Fund (USCOX)  </a> </u> . This allows us to mitigate risk and deploy that cash when stocks look attractive per our model, which focuses on factors like high returns on invested capital, sales per share growth and dividend per share growth.</p><h3> The Trend is Your Friend</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s common for investors to look at gross domestic product (GDP) when making decisions about how to deploy capital. Unlike GDP, which looks back or in the rearview mirror, PMI is forward-looking. PMI gathers data such as global output, new orders, exports, prices and employment, making it a reliable indicator for both commodity performance and business activity. ISM, or Manufacturing Institute for Supply Management, is the U.S.-specific calculation of PMI.</p><p> Take a look at global PMI. It has continued on a three-month downtrend for the month of June.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-Global-PMI-Continues-Its-Downtrend-07102015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Global Manufacturing PMI Continues Its Downtrend\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-Global-PMI-Continues-Its-Downtrend-07102015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> Similarly, PMI in the U.S. peaked seven months ago but has since been modestly declining. The threat of rising rates has been a contributing factor, and although Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen stated Friday that the U.S. is on track to raise rates in September, many agree that this date is too soon.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-US-Manufacturing-PMI-Declines-After-Peak-07102015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Manufacturing PMI Declines After Peak\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-US-Manufacturing-PMI-Declines-After-Peak-07102015.gif\"/> </a></p><h3> Card Counting: Using the PMI Pattern to Your Investing Advantage</h3><p> <br/> Understanding PMI is one way investors can use patterns to improve their chances of positive returns in the market &ndash; just like card counting in a game of Blackjack.</p><p> When looking at PMIs, a reading of 50 or above indicates manufacturing expansion, while a reading below 50 indicates a slowing economy. PMIs for individual countries like China and Greece are negative right now, meaning that manufacturing activity is contracting.</p><p> Our investment team&rsquo;s research has shown that when the one-month reading crossed below the three-month trend, there was a significant probability that materials, energy and commodities would fall six months later. Conversely, when it crossed above, manufacturing activity would ramp up, which greatly improved the performance of commodities such as copper and crude oil, along with the materials and energy sectors.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-Commodities-and-Commodity-Stocks-Historically-Rose-Six-Months-After-PMI-Cross-Above-Cross-Below-07102015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt='Commodities and Commodity Stocks Historically Rose Six Months After PMI \"Cross-Above\"' src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-Commodities-and-Commodity-Stocks-Historically-Rose-Six-Months-After-PMI-Cross-Above-Cross-Below-07102015.gif\"/> </a></p><h3> The Great Shift in Seasonal Oil</h3><p> <br/> As I explain in our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/files/pdfs/researchreports/2014/Managing-Expectations-Whitepaper-09-2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Managing Expectations whitepaper  </a> </u> , using seasonal patterns, along with global PMI, is another way to understand trends in the market and the world at large.</p><p> Historically, the hurricane season in August/September has shut down the supply of oil offshore, leading to a peak in relative price around this time. But as you can see in the chart below, the new technology of fracking and a corresponding increase of U.S. onshore production, have led to a surplus, drastically shifting the shorter-term seasonal pattern in oil.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-Historical-Patterns-of-Oil-Price-07102015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Manufacturing PMI Declines After Peak\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-10/COMM-Historical-Patterns-of-Oil-Price-07102015.gif\"/> </a></p><h3> Staying Nimble During Changing Landscapes</h3><p> <br/> Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford, Marcus du Sautoy, said it best:</p><p> &ldquo;Although the world looks messy and chaotic, if you translate it into the world of numbers and shapes, patterns emerge and you start to understand why things are the way they are.&rdquo;</p><p> The global markets right now indeed appear &ldquo;messy and chaotic,&rdquo; but curious investors and fund managers realize that specific tools and patterns help them navigate through the complexity and intensity of constantly changing landscapes.</p><p> In fact, it is the agile active management and the use of these investment tools that landed two of our funds in Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily&rsquo;s &ldquo;Weekly Review&rdquo; section last week.

{"original_id":2080,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Too Stuck in Your Ways? The Upside and Downside to Being Compliant","link":"too-stuck-in-your-ways-the-upside-and-downside-to-being-compliant","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The &ldquo;High Cs&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> They are always on time, never miss a meeting or a deadline, and invariably know what is the right thing to do in every situation; these efficient people-engines bring a sense of stability, certainty and orderliness into every workplace that is lucky enough to have them. Because at The Collaborative we rely on DISC quite a bit, we simply call them the &ldquo;High Cs,&rdquo; where the &ldquo;C&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;Compliance&rdquo; or &ldquo;Conscientiousness,&rdquo; a measure of personal behavior that outlines one&rsquo;s typical response to rules and procedures set by others. High Cs can be described as exacting, systematic and unbending; they value the rules and believe in following them to the letter. On the other end of the scale we have the &ldquo;Low Cs,&rdquo; people who are more flexible, open-minded and unsystematic.</p><p> Employees working in the same environment can differ greatly from one another based on where they rate on a scale of 1-100 for their &ldquo;C&rdquo; score. Using a personal assessment tool such as  <u>  DISC </u>  can help employees develop a deeper understanding of their compliance tendencies, as well as getting a better idea of how others tend to see them.</p><p> It&rsquo;s beneficial to be aware of both perspectives, as oftentimes people&rsquo;s perception of their own self doesn&rsquo;t match that of others. For example, while a High C person may see him- or herself as cautious, careful, accurate, logical, thorough, well-organized or driven by good judgement, others can interpret the same behavior as worrisome, picky, fussy, perfectionistic, controlling, obstinate or defensive. The same principle holds for the Low Cs as well: one colleague can describe them as nonconformist, curious, flexible or unorthodox, while another may deem their behavior to be frivolous, irrational, impulsive, etc.</p><h3> Genetics Has Nothing to Do With It </h3><p> <br/> An argument exists that some people prefer following the rules (systematic High C types), while others are almost allergic to them, because it&rsquo;s part of their nature. In other words, people don&rsquo;t choose to be rational and systematic or flexible and diplomatic; these qualities are inherent to them. This long-held belief that people use either the rational or creative side of the brain, however, has been recently refuted by the University of Utah&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071275\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u> . The study showed that our inclination to either challenge or comply with the rules is not caused by genetics; it&rsquo;s a learned behavior that is heavily influenced by an individual&rsquo;s character, various circumstances and lifestyle.</p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10400419.2013.783744#.VY4pqflViko\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2013 study  </a> </u>  of 60 visual artists and 60 bank officers, published in the Creativity Research Journal, argues for this point as well. In this study, European researchers investigated the effects of temperament and divergent thinking on the creative potential of the participants. The results showed that temperament plays a major role in determining personal activity levels: a higher personal activity score leads to a more diverse lifestyle, which makes people more prone to divergent thinking.</p><p> In his interview for the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/love-or-hate-the-type-who-makes-trains-run-on-time-1432671204?mg=id-wsj\" target=\"_blank\">   Wall Street Journal  </a> </u> , Brandon Mikel Smith, founder and principal of Worksmiths LLC, an Atlanta executive-coaching firm, corroborates the point that affinity to highly systematic thinking is an acquired trait. He explains that &ldquo;many rigid people grew up in turbulent homes that made them long for stability, or with a hypercritical parent who taught them that anything less than perfect wasn&rsquo;t good enough.&rdquo; Altogether the scientific evidence points to a fact that even though &ldquo;by-the-book&rdquo; individuals are not born with systematic thinking, their behavioral style is built into them as firmly as their DNA; following the rules is a part of their mentality and therefore can be exceedingly difficult to modify.</p><h3> Helping to Better Cope&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Despite the fact that High Cs make great contributions to their organizations, they can also become a target of their colleagues&rsquo;criticism: While their rigor is absolutely indispensable for seamless and efficient running of the office, their penchant for perfectionism, occasional inflexibility and strict adherence to the rules often make them quite difficult to work with or for. A recent Wall Street Journal article,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/love-or-hate-the-type-who-makes-trains-run-on-time-1432671204?mg=id-wsj\" target=\"_blank\">   They Make the Trains Run on Time, but at What Cost?  </a> </u> , highlights this issue and provides the readers with some advice for &ldquo;dealing with inflexible people&rdquo; in the work environment.</p><p> As a coach, my objective is not only to determine how to help employees better cope with the overly systematic behaviors of their colleagues, but more importantly figure out how to help every member of the team cope better. Regardless of whether one is a High or Low C individual, each type of behavior has its advantages and disadvantages. Recognizing and effectively managing the disadvantages can make the difference between success and failure.</p><p> Somewhat strained relationships with a few colleagues is one potential disadvantage of being a High C type. The other disadvantage is less obvious but just as dangerous: Sometimes when trying to do the right thing, strict rule followers miss certain important nuances and inadvertently limit their opportunities for professional growth and career advancement. The majority of High C employees are highly intelligent and talented people, and usually all they need is a touch of flexibility in order to move their careers to the next level.</p><h3> Making Changes</h3><p> <br/> Trying to change one&rsquo;s behaviors or beliefs is never easy and can take quite some time. Effective transformation always includes three key elements:</p><li> awareness of the need for change,</li><li> acceptance of that need, and</li><li> ambition to make change happen. <br/>  </li><p> Systematic High C types may not always realize that they need to change something about their ways, especially when their performance is nothing short of flawless. Simply &ldquo;Be more creative&rdquo; may sound quite ridiculous to them, as it doesn&rsquo;t provide any logical explanation or instructions for what they need to do better or differently.</p><p> Personalized professional guidance is the most optimal solution in such cases. At The Collaborative we know that working with a coach or mentor helps significantly in advancing one&rsquo;s career to the next level. As for the advice that High Cs can start applying immediately:</p><li> Be open to new experiences and try new things in life in order to strengthen your divergent thinking.</li><li> Always look at things from an alternative perspective in addition to your customary way of dealing with problems.</li><li> Remember that while there is &ldquo;safety&rdquo; in the facts and data, you are dealing with human beings. We are much more emotional than rational; develop your human side.</li><li> You have learned the rules, now you need to learn to use them effectively to get what you want to accomplish done, while winning over your team members (and the boss, too!).</li>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-14 18:26:37.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-14 18:26:37.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_lL1eAjZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/too-stuck-in-your-ways-the-upside-and-downside-to-being-compliant/\", \"post_id\": \"4725\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-14 18:26:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-14 18:26:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"too-stuck-in-your-ways-the-upside-and-downside-to-being-compliant\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4724\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2113\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436812911242-3d475df4bdd1-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"614\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436958000,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}

Big difference!A few days later, that story was included in an  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-times-fine-wine-led-to-a-fine-mess-2014-11-06?siteid=rss&amp;rss=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   article  </u>    </a> on MarketWatch, a website for business and finance news, about five wine-related blunders that turned out to be very costly. Here are some guidelines for ordering wine so you don&rsquo;t end up on that list: <strong>  1. Learn about wine. </strong>  You will make a better choice, whether as host or guest, if you know something about the product. There are many books and websites with lots of information about wine. You can take a class at an adult-education school or wine store.  Visits to wineries also can be helpful. The general guideline is that white wine is served with fish and poultry and red wine with meat, but there are numerous exceptions. <strong>  2. If you are the host,  </strong> you are in charge of the wine selection. As mentioned above, knowing a little about wine will make your decision easier. You can ask the wine steward, or sommelier, to recommend some wines. Most of them are very knowledgeable and will be happy to pair your food choices with wine. Just make sure you are clear about the price!Participating in the wine-tasting process is also part of the host&rsquo;s responsibility. The wine steward will present the bottle&rsquo;s label for your review and then pour a small amount of wine into your glass. You should taste the wine and (usually) nod approval. Send wine back only if it is spoiled. Do not send the wine back because you do not like the taste. (The five wine-tasting steps are explained through my acronym LaCEST&trade;, and can be found in my book,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071811265/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0071811265&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pachasso-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Essentials of Business Etiquette: How to Greet, Eat, and Tweet Your Way to Success  </a> </u> .) <strong>  3. Check the wine list ahead of time. </strong>  Many restaurants post their wine lists on their websites. Pick a few bottles and research those. Though not all restaurants have prices on their website wine list, your research will give you a general idea of the price range for a wine. Keep in mind, however, that restaurants mark up the price. <strong>  4. Know your budget. </strong>  Have a general idea about what you want to spend before you go to the restaurant. There are many good, reasonably priced wines to be found. Look for wine that you have enjoyed before.  And remember that the most expensive bottle on the list is not always the best.  If you are celebrating a big occasion, or your guest loves a certain wine, you may choose to increase your budget.  You can give the sommelier your price range by pointing at a price &ndash; not a wine &ndash; and saying something like, &ldquo;I was looking for something like this.&rdquo; <strong>  5. Be cautious if you defer to your guest. </strong>  He or she may order a bottle outside of your budget. Some salespeople have reported that when they have deferred to their guests, those guests sometimes ordered very expensive bottles of wine. But that&rsquo;s not always a bad thing. One director told me, &ldquo;My client just gave me two million dollars&rsquo; worth of business, so he can order whatever he likes!&rdquo;Regardless of the wine chosen, or whether you are the host or the guest, do not drink too much. You need to stay sober. It is easy to blunder when your faculties are impaired by alcohol.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-14 18:06:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-14 18:06:41.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_bODZbo4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-tips-for-ordering-wine-at-a-business-meal/\", \"post_id\": \"4723\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-14 18:06:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-14 18:06:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-tips-for-ordering-wine-at-a-business-meal\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4722\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2112\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/awinecolumn0607.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"390\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436986800,"author_id":51,"chart_url":""}

She began with herself and two close friends and now the company has grown, on average, 10 percent per year for the last six years. Currently the company is situated in two cities, it is growing and thriving. It is a great entrepreneurial story.</p><p> One of the original employees, a friend, who started working out of the living room with the founder/CEO, is president of the company. The president and the CEO have been through thick and thin over these last few years. Lately, turnover in the company is creeping upward.</p><p> The president is young and has not developed professional management skills. Although she is bright, able to assert and see down the path and anticipate, she is not good when it comes to relating to people. In fact, she would prefer to avoid human contact entirely. For example, even when someone is in the office, she would rather send emails and text messages rather than meet face-to-face with anyone.</p><p> Additionally, the president shows little tolerance for people who she perceives are not as smart as she. She shows little acknowledgement for other&rsquo;s ideas, rolls her eyes during meetings with her staff and will literally put her hands up in someone&rsquo;s face when she is done hearing&ndash;not listening&ndash;to someone else. (She says it&rsquo;s better than yelling at them to &ldquo;stop!&rdquo;)</p><p> The CEO has witnessed the president&rsquo;s behavior and has not said nor done anything. Instead, the president continues to make a very good salary and receives additional monetary gifts because the CEO perceives her president as the gatekeeper for her. The CEO also believes that the president&rsquo;s actions are justified because the company continues to grow at a consistent rate. The turnover rate, which is higher than the respective industry standard, is blamed on everyone else but her president.</p><p> So, not only is the CEO condoning these actions, she enables the president to continue with bad behavior because she is rewarded for bad behavior.</p><p> For the president to do right by the company as well as her friend/CEO, she needs to make new choices:</p><li> Learn to work with others.</li><li> Listen to others&rsquo; ideas.</li><li> Learn interpersonal etiquette and see an etiquette coach for assistance.</li><li> Learn to manage others with open and frequent dialogue.</li><li> Share her thoughts and philosophy on a regular basis so people can align.</li><li> Communicate weekly about what&rsquo;s going on within the company so people feel a part of the organization and have a sense of relationship with her, that way she is someone they want to go to for assistance. <br/>  </li><p> When the CEO brings on an executive vice president to oversee the largest division of the company, it is crucial that he be successfully brought on board so he can begin carrying out the company vision. (He is, after all, the fourth person they have hired for this position in the last three years.) For this hire to be a success, the president must pull her head out of the sand and stop thinking of herself.</p><p> However, instead of connecting one-on-one, she simply provides the VP with a training manual and other executive materials explaining the company history and approach.</p><p> Her frustration with others and disengagement overall indicates a lack of fulfillment. This is overflowing into her work and will ultimately have an impact on the company both in the short-term and long-term.</p><p> One has to wonder:</p><li> Does this president really like her job?</li><li> Does she really want to do what she is doing?</li><li> She has little patience for others, does she not like working on a team?</li><li> Does she just feel an obligation to stay in this job and to continue to support her friend because of their history?</li><li> Does she stay only because of loyalty? <br/>  </li><p> Additionally, the CEO has to examine the situation to get past loyalties:</p><li> Help the president learn to adjust so she can work with people in a collaborative fashion.</li><li> Be more connected to the people in her organization rather than leave it up to others like the president. It is, after all, her company.</li><li> Limit the president&rsquo;s role and cease the monetary rewards for behavior that doesn&rsquo;t warrant reward.</li><li> Possibly the president needs to move to a different role or out of the organization. <br/>  </li><p> If growth and success is hampered by employees that have been kept on because of loyalty, then loyalties need to be re-examined. While there may be difficult decisions, hanging on to loyalties for loyalty&rsquo;s sake, will harm the business overall.</p><p> The choice is yours!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-14 17:59:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-14 17:59:20.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_HABuZKg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-let-loyalty-get-in-the-way-of-success/\", \"post_id\": \"4721\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-14 17:59:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-14 17:59:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-let-loyalty-get-in-the-way-of-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4720\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2111\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1020\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436960700,"author_id":458,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2076,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What's Wrong With Delaying Transactions When A Client Has Diminished Capacity","link":"whats-wrong-with-delaying-transactions-when-a-client-has-diminished-capacity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The securities industry is pushing  to impose temporary holds on certain transactions that may be precipitated by a clients&rsquo; declining mental capacity, or purported loved ones who may be trying to swindle them.  Sounds good in theory. Too bad it won&rsquo;t solve the problem of financial abuse.  Does the industry think that waiting is going to make the problem of predators go away?</p><p> Here is an example of a real case in which this exact method of the broker waiting and hoping didn&rsquo;t do a thing for the elder who was being abused.  Here&rsquo;s what happened:</p><p> A frail 94 year old man was in the habit of giving his no-count son money for everything from drug rehab to have-a-fun-time.  Theirs was a sort of co-dependency.  Maybe dad felt needed and sonny boy just thought he could always manipulate dad into giving him cash.  But when dad developed dementia, everyone who was responsible for him should have removed the power for financial decisions from him.  He had another son, who was to take over as the appointed successor to dad on dad&rsquo;s trust. The trust had dad&rsquo;s big IRA and the rest of his cash in it.</p><p> Sonny boy flies out to see dad and drags him to dad&rsquo;s broker. Dad can&rsquo;t dress himself, can&rsquo;t drive and can&rsquo;t spend money even if he has it in hand.  Dad, prompted by sonny boy, asks the broker for a cashier&rsquo;s check for $60,000.  The broker delays for a week or so. Dad, promoted by the manipulative son, calls and wants to know where the check is.  Broker then hands over the cashier&rsquo;s check. Sonny boy of course snatches it.  <strong>  Delay didn&rsquo;t do a thing to stop the abuse. </strong>  The broker thinks he should call the other son, who  he knows is appointed to be dad&rsquo;s successor trustee, but he thinks he can&rsquo;t because of privacy laws.</p><p> Next, sonny boy tells dad to ask the broker to give him a debit card for the cash management account, which contains the rest of dad&rsquo;s money.  That way, sonny can have a great time withdrawing whatever he wants when no one is looking.  The broker again delays, this time for three months. Sonny boy again prompts dad to bug the broker. Broker then hands over the debit card, but fortunately it is mailed to the other son. In this case, the other son contacted me for advice. I told him to destroy the debit card and get his legal paperwork done so he could officially stop his brother, sonny boy from plundering dad&rsquo;s account any further.</p><h3> The Missing Pieces In FINRA&rsquo;s Attempts To Stop Abuse</h3><p> <br/> As I see it, FINRA is trying to put a band-aid over a gaping wound. It won&rsquo;t fit and it won&rsquo;t stop the bleeding. First, the industry needs clear guidance or some way of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/diminishedcapacitywebinar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   measuring diminished capacity  </a> </u> . They provide none. We at  <u>  <a href=\"https://aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestor.com  </a> </u>  have done th at for you. We give you the red flags and score them so you at least have a way to track the signs of diminished capacity in an orderly and uniform way.  Use recognized ways to do this and put a number on it.</p><p> Next, no clear way to  <u>  get past the privacy concerns </u>  has yet been established by the industry.  No wonder.  You&rsquo;re financial professionals. We&rsquo;ve done that for you, too, at  <u>  <a href=\"https://aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestor.com  </a> </u> . We have the necessary expertise. You need a standardized document, following established legal principles, that lets you contact third parties. The best part of what we&rsquo;ve created is that the circumstances of when it&rsquo;s okay to call a third party are defined in writing, proactively and with the client&rsquo;s consent.</p><p> Finally, once you&rsquo;ve figured out that a client has diminished capacity  <strong>  there is no clear path to follow other than delay. </strong> We can see from the above example that delay in some cases, if not all, is not going to stop an abuser. He&rsquo;ll just wait and then commit the predatory acts later.  Waiting is hoping for some magical thing to happen in the wait time. No one in the regulatory industry tells you what you are supposed to do while you wait.  If you haven&rsquo;t solved the privacy problem, how are you going to get past that so you can communicate with anyone in a position to protect the elder?  And who is supposed to stop the predator?</p><p> Get this: Delay does not fix abuse. It may put it off but that&rsquo;s it.  Unless you find a way to cut off the head of the evil snake of elder abuse it will continue to strike repeatedly.  If you want to see what to actually do other than wring your hands in frustration, go to <a href=\"https://aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   AgingInvestor.com  </u> </a>  and find out some practical ways to prevent predators from swindling your elderly clients. It takes a whole  <u>  senior-specific policy </u>  to do the job. And we&rsquo;ve got a  <u>  template all worked out for you </u> . You don&rsquo;t need to be or feel helpless. You can take action right now to stop predators.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-14 17:30:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-14 17:30:52.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_MfzSNKK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/whats-wrong-with-delaying-transactions-when-a-client-has-diminished-capacity/\", \"post_id\": \"4717\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-14 17:30:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-14 17:30:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"whats-wrong-with-delaying-transactions-when-a-client-has-diminished-capacity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4716\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2109\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-10.36.34-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"494\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436976000,"author_id":91,"chart_url":""}

This didn&rsquo;t happen overnight. It&rsquo;s not like Greece has always been a picture of financial health and just recently fell on tough times.</p><p> Greece has been broke for ages. As has the Greek banking system&ndash; overstuffed with government IOUs and bad loans that have no hope of being repaid.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re seeing everything unfold in the headlines. Bank runs. Capital controls. Default.</p><p> It all starts with debt. Whenever a country gets too deep into debt, it&rsquo;s going to get into trouble. History is very clear on this point.</p><p> Debt almost always leads to negative consequences, most notably default.</p><p> They&rsquo;ll either default on their private creditors, i.e. the poor souls who loaned them money to begin with.</p><p> Or they&rsquo;ll default on foreign governments, creating destructive trade wars and currency crises.</p><p> Mostly, though, they&rsquo;ll default on their obligations to their citizens&ndash; suspending pension payments, imposing capital controls, raising taxes, destroying the value of the currency, and bailing in the banks with customer deposits.</p><p> Debt kills. And sooner or later, if history is any guide, nearly every heavily indebted nation will resort to this very limited playbook.</p><p> Just look at Greece: the government has established tight restrictions over bank withdrawals and is even preventing people from accessing safety deposit boxes.</p><p> This highlights yet again that banks are merely an extension of their governments&ndash; stooges that will turn against you in a heartbeat and comply with every order their bankrupt master gives them.</p><p> It&rsquo;s foolish to hold one&rsquo;s life savings within the banking system of a heavily-indebted nation.</p><p> And doing something about it need not be complicated.</p><p> It&rsquo;s 2015. You can move savings to an offshore bank account (i.e. a stable foreign bank with very strong fundamentals) without having to leave town.</p><p> Or in some cases, without leaving your living room.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also easy to hold real assets like gold and silver in a fully insured, non-bank safety deposit box overseas.</p><p> This is sound advice for anyone living in a heavily-indebted nation.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not some wild assertion or conspiracy theory to acknowledge that there&rsquo;s risk in the system. The publicly-available data is very clear: almost every western nation is insolvent and far past the point of no return.</p><p> These are real risks not to be assumed away. They&rsquo;re uncomfortable and unpopular to think about. But they are not negligible.</p><p> And in the face of such clear data, rational, thinking people ought to have a Plan B.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-14 17:24:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-14 17:24:35.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_2BWoqtH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-one-common-feature-in-every-financial-crisis/\", \"post_id\": \"4715\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-14 17:24:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-14 17:24:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-one-common-feature-in-every-financial-crisis\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4714\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2108\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo.jpeg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"618\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436968800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2074,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Steps to Accomplish Your Marketing Goals","link":"6-steps-to-accomplish-your-marketing-goals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> A lot&rsquo;s been said about goal setting.</p><p> Some things have become apparent as I&rsquo;ve spoken with Marketing Managers.</p><li> They have trouble articulating their company&rsquo;s goals.</li><li> Many companies don&rsquo;t have goals at all, or at least senior leaders don&rsquo;t share them with the rest of the company.</li><li> Goals aren&rsquo;t specific enough. <br/>  </li><p> Now that&rsquo;s not a criticism of the marketing managers I&rsquo;ve spoken with.</p><p> Many are working so hard to do their jobs that there&rsquo;s no time for anything else.</p><p> Many wish they had that direction from their managers.</p><p> Many don&rsquo;t know how they fit into the puzzle.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why I wrote this blog. Here are six steps that will help the tired, overworked marketing manager accomplish their goals. My hope is that this will help create some dialog at your company and get everyone pointed in the right direction.  Who should you share this blog with?</p><p> Here are the 6 steps to accomplish your marketing goals:</p><h3> 1. Write Them Down</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know where you are going, you&rsquo;ll end up someplace else.&rdquo; <br/> &ndash; Yogi Berra</p><p> I love this quote from Yogi Berra, because it&rsquo;s the truth, isn&rsquo;t it?  The problem with not writing down your goals is that time passes, you put out fires, deal with staff issues, take a vacation or two, and when it&rsquo;s time to reflect, you can&rsquo;t remember exactly what the goal was.</p><p> Actually putting the pen to paper is critical for succeeding. Some like to be formal about it &mdash; write a detailed narrative, print it, bind it and keep it handy. Others prefer the post it note that sits on the corner of the desk. Regardless of where you are on the continuum, write down your goals and you&rsquo;ll hit them more often.</p><h3> 2. Define Measurable Outcomes</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hit a target you cannot see, and you cannot see a target you do not have.&rdquo; <br/> &ndash; Zig Ziglar</p><p> When you set goals for your marketing, they need to be SMART. SMART stands for:</p><li> Specific &ndash; Be as specific as you can about your goal. Don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;get more leads from our website.&rdquo;</li><li> Measurable &ndash; Commit to some real numbers that you have the capability to track and measure.</li><li> Attainable &ndash; You know the limitations of your team, your time and your budget. You may need to get creative to reach the goal, but don&rsquo;t stretch too far.</li><li> Realistic &ndash; Goals have dependencies, and you have to set goals that can be reached. You probably aren&rsquo;t going to double your revenue in a year if you grew by 3% last year.</li><li> Timebound &ndash; Your goals should have specific milestones with dates to check progress.</li><p> Are your goals structured this way?</p><h3> 3. Refer To Them Regularly</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.&rdquo; <br/> &ndash; Jimmy Dean</p><p> It&rsquo;s one thing to set goals for you, your team and your department, but how often do you read them over and check your progress?  Do they become a steering mechanism for your daily actions and plans?</p><p> I like keeping my goals visible. As the owner of the business, I keep up with my &ldquo;4 things.&rdquo; I have 4 business goals at any given point in time, and I do my best to make sure everything that&rsquo;s done in a day makes a contribution. The most important one is on a post it note on the wall beside my desk. When I look out of the window, I see it every day.</p><p> How often are you reading your goals and making plans to accomplish them baby step by baby step?</p><h3> 4. Align Your Team</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Define your business goals clearly so that others can see them as you do.&rdquo; <br/> &ndash; George F. Burns</p><p> Everybody needs to be on the same &ldquo;sheet of music.&rdquo; One of the best pieces of advice I ever received in my career is that in order to reach a my goals for the business, everyone on the team needs to accomplish their goals.  Those goals should &ldquo;roll up&rdquo; to mine.</p><p> Working together &mdash; all contributing to the same goals &mdash; we make progress faster. Do you take time in staff meetings to discuss your goals? Are your employees excited that they help contribute to the success of the entire team?</p><h3> 5. Share Progress With Everyone</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Having an exciting destination is like setting a needle in your compass. From then on, the compass knows only one point-its ideal. And it will faithfully guide you there through the darkest nights and fiercest storms.&rdquo; <br/> &ndash; Daniel Boone</p><p> When you share progress toward a goal, it helps to orient the team. When you&rsquo;re close to meeting the goal, it strengthens team morale. When you are falling short, it can motivate everyone to try harder or figure out a course correction.</p><p> Depending on the timeline for your goals, consider discussing progress either monthly or quarterly. Are you taking time in your team meetings or one-on-one meetings to discuss goals?  Are your team meetings too tactical?</p><h3> 6. Stick to the Plan</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;The urgent can drown out the important.&rdquo; <br/> &ndash; Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo!</p><p> Even when you have a defined goal and a plan to accomplish it, your focus can waiver.</p><p> In our business, we never know when a huge problem may pop up. A server goes down, the internet connection goes down, a client wants a meeting out of town, you have a campaign plan that&rsquo;s due, your certification has expired&hellip; You get it &mdash; you deal with these things, too!</p><p> One thing I find helpful is to carve out some time weekly to plan. Some weeks, the plan looks good. Other times, I realize we are behind and need to change things up. Dedicating time to that takes discipline, and sometimes late nights (after the family is in bed is the best, most productive time for me to plan).</p><p> Are you disciplined enough to stick to the plan? Is your team devoted and bought into the plan? Do you know when to pivot?</p><p> Is it time that you formalize some goals at your company?

{"original_id":2073,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How an Attitude Shift Can Change Your Retirement Fortunes","link":"how-an-attitude-shift-can-change-your-retirement-fortunes","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This summer when a former Russian beauty queen emerged ebullient from a London courtroom after winning an attractive divorce settlement from her ex-husband, a wealthy American lawyer, I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, I expected the judge to reduce the award for Ekaterina Fields when the cad-designer mother of two insisted she could only live in a Kensington or Chelsea neighborhood. But why shouldn&rsquo;t she continue to enjoy the same living standards as her husband? The settlement is a big win compared with divorce in the &lsquo;80s and &lsquo;90s when women often downsized with their children to a smaller house or townhouse.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-6.50.17-PM.png\" width=\"592\"/></p><p> Elin Nordegren, the former wife of pro golfer Tiger Woods, teed up even better when the one-time nanny walked away with $110 million from her divorce. Tiger has been on a losing streak since the divorce and needs to pay up $54 million by January 2016. Elin tugged at our heart strings as she publicly tried to save her marriage and family over taking the huge settlement. Today, Elin is single and reportedly holds a lien towards the unpaid amount on one of Tiger&rsquo;s homes.</p><p> Women are not only coming out of divorces financially stronger. They are quickly closing the wealth gap with men. Women now have decision-making power over 39% of the $28.6 trillion in investible assets in the United States, according to the Center for Talent Innovation. This wealth is increasing as women continue to live longer than men. Female wages are also rising, although they still lag behind those of men.</p><p> Despite their growing financial wealth, when it comes to retirement savings  <br/> women fall short of men. Women about to retire face a shortfall of $63,000 versus $34,000 for men, according to a 2015 Employee Benefit Research Institute survey. True, women are serving more time as caregivers as part of the sandwich generation juggling college-aged children and aging parents &ndash; traditionally, a major reason for their income shortfall. But these family obligations still do not explain the shortfall in female retirement plans.</p><p> After you read about the superior investment performance of women, you may want to fire your financial advisor.</p><h3> Levelling the Financial Advisory Playing Field </h3><p> <br/> Did you know that women are more successful investors than men? According to most measures, women outperform men as investors. Even on a risk-adjusted basis, more conservative female investors outperformed male investors, 4.7% versus 4.2% in 2014, according to SigFig&rsquo;s survey of its clients. Women even paid more in fund fees! So why do we not have a larger investment portfolio?</p><p> As women, evidently, we need to not only be more aggressive in the divorce courts, but also in the financial advisory field. Changing your attitude towards wealth management can change your fortunes. Consider Singapore women who demand and receive wage equality with men and also save the same amount for retirement.</p><p> Here are more reasons why, as the more astute investor, your investment advisor should be helping you increase your retirement savings.</p><h3> Women:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Are More Risk Adverse Than Men </strong>  &ndash; Risk aversion is a proven and winning female trait in business. Women are two-thirds more likely to be successful in starting a business and growing assets due to their more cautious approach to risk management.</p><p> <strong>  Focus on Wealth Preservation </strong>  &ndash; A lower risk and passive investment strategy helps female investors outperform males who prefer active trading in higher growth stocks. Men turnover their stock holdings 50% more often than women and are 25% more likely to lose money, finds SigFig.</p><p> <strong>  Save More </strong>  &ndash; Women put more money in savings and cash equivalents (e.g., government treasury bonds and certificates of deposit), while men place more money in the stock market. Women need to do more of both. Whether you are in your 30s or 60s, you are healthier than previous generations. But like many female investors you likely bought into a retirement plan in your 20s more suitable to your grandmother&rsquo;s generation. These plans were not developed for the scenario in which you work into your 70s and live until the age of 90 or 100.</p><p> Are you aware that single women &ndash; including divorcees &ndash; live even longer than married women (a little known upside of divorce :) Back to how to cover sthe retirement shortfall. It is never too early to divert some of the money you spend on $80 yoga outfits to your retirement plan to cover your longer lifespan. Some savings should also be allocated to higher returning passive and value investments.</p><p> <strong>  Continue to Do Good </strong>  &ndash; Women are the largest investors in socially responsible investments (SRI). Like value investing, owing to the stricter investment criteria, SRI investments should outperform the overall market. Naturally, you may be asking why you are generating average returns. One drawback has been a smaller universe of ethical investment choices, but as companies place more emphasis on SRI practices to attract the growth in ethical investors, this disadvantage is disappearing.</p><p> When planning for retirement, exercise your growing financial clout. Choose a wealth manager who works with other upwardly mobile women. Your wealth manager needs to put you on the same wealth track as male clients. Ask to see samples of female portfolio returns.</p><p> Recent triumphs in the divorce courts are a sign of the change in women&rsquo;s attitudes towards money. Women deserve and are winning payouts to support the same living standards as men. Demand no less from your retirement planning.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-14 17:08:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-14 17:08:58.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Kao4O5O.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-an-attitude-shift-can-change-your-retirement-fortunes/\", \"post_id\": \"4711\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-14 17:08:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-14 17:08:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-an-attitude-shift-can-change-your-retirement-fortunes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4709\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2106\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAJjAAAAJGQ1NzQ5ZTg4LWFkMjUtNGFmNC04MDJiLTRhYzA2ZjI4YzAyYQ.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"543\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436959800,"author_id":372,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2072,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Missed Match","link":"the-missed-match","source_link":null,"content":"<p> After reading last week's $ense, we're certain that you double checked your 401(k) contributions to make sure that you are at least getting the full match from your employer (hint, hint). Say your employer matches 4% and you're contributing 4%. \"Done and done,\" you think. But, you could still be missing out. The higher and/or more variable your income is and the higher your contribution rate, the more you could be at risk of missing out on free company money.  Excusez-moi?</p><h3> The thing is, your company match is just that - a match.</h3><p> <br/> If your contributions from each paycheck reach the annual IRS limit before the end of the year ($18,000 under age 50 and $24,000 age 50+) your employer may stop pulling from your paycheck for the balance of the year. And, you guessed it&hellip; no contributions by you means no match by the employer. Ultimately, if you max out before the end of the year, it's possible that your employer will have only contributed a percentage of the income you earned before you maxed out. That means, the income earned for the balance of the year goes match-less.  </p><p> The Fix: First, check with your HR department to see if they offer a \"true-up\" contribution at the end of the year to fix this common oversight by employees. If they don't, change your contribution from a percentage of your income to a set dollar amount so that you will not max out before the end of the year.

{"original_id":2071,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Easiest Mistakes to Avoid When Pitching Your Business Case","link":"5-easiest-mistakes-to-avoid-when-pitching-your-business-case","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  When creating and pitching business cases, even experien  ced presenters can fall victim to a few common mistakes. </strong></p><p> Here are the five most frequent mistakes managers make when pitching their business cases, and easy ways for you to avoid them.</p><h3> Mistake #1: Failing to address strategic goals</h3><p> <br/> If a project has an impressive ROI, it&rsquo;s easy to assume the project&rsquo;s benefits speak for themselves. This often happens with IT initiatives. Say, for example, you want to implement an enterprise content management system to store information and automate associated business processes. You&rsquo;ll likely build your case around the fact that the system will pay off in six months&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not what stakeholders are looking for.</p><p> When you are building your case, be sure to demonstrate that you&rsquo;re meeting a clear business need that aligns with stakeholders&rsquo; goals. Is your organization seeking to generate revenue? Increase customer satisfaction? Avoid hiring additional staff? Whatever goals your stakeholders have, show how your project aligns with them&mdash;and how it can help them achieve their goals while you achieve yours.</p><h3> Mistake #2: Ignoring other departments</h3><p> <br/> In the excitement of working on your initiative, it&rsquo;s far too easy to forget how your idea affects other departments. How will it benefit them? What will they need to do to make sure your project gets off the ground? What new work will they have once the new system is in place? Include this information in your case&mdash;stakeholders will want to see it.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re developing your case, it helps to include experts whose departments will be affected by your idea. Share drafts of estimated costs and benefits with them and ask if you&rsquo;ve been accurate in your estimates of your project&rsquo;s effects on their teams. Ask if you&rsquo;ve accounted for training costs, transition costs and timing. Getting their buy-in is key to your project&rsquo;s ultimate success.</p><h3> Mistake #3: Forgetting transition costs and timing</h3><p> <br/> Some managers forget to factor in what it takes to make the switch to a new system. Have you included the costs of new hardware? Migration? Training? What will happen to your old system, if you have one?</p><p> Even if you feel the new system is likely to be adopted swiftly, stakeholders need a handle on transition costs before they can decide whether to give the green light to your project. Even if you can&rsquo;t give them exact figures, include rough estimates based on similar projects. This shows stakeholders that you&rsquo;ve considered all the angles and helps you gain their confidence.</p><h3> Mistake #4: Glossing over risks</h3><p> <br/> The easiest way to poke holes in a business case is to ask &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; It can be difficult to spot risks on your own, so ask someone to help you. As you&rsquo;re building your case, ask that person to challenge the assumptions you&rsquo;ve come up with. You can also try these questions to spur ideas:</p><li> What if someone else developed the project plan? What would the project look like if IT took the lead? What about HR? Marketing?</li><li> What if things were different? What if you had twice or half the time to complete the project? What if you had an unlimited budget? What if you did it yourself?</li><li> What if we did nothing? Don&rsquo;t forget to consider the consequences of inaction. <br/>  </li><p> Encourage your team to think like your stakeholders and raise the concerns they are likely to have. Does your CTO insist on developing every project in-house because he believes <u>  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/ECMBlog/selecting-the-right-document-management-system-dms-3?utm_source=iris.localhost.lan&amp;utm_medium=ad-digital&amp;utm_campaign=07%2F14%2F15\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   vendors don&rsquo;t deliver  </a> </u> ? Does your CFO believe that every project will run over budget, no matter what? Does your COO distrust technology because she believes &ldquo;people do it best&rdquo;? Think about what objections your approval committee is likely to have so you are prepared for them. Even better, ask stakeholders ahead of time.</p><h3> Mistake #5: Using jargon</h3><p> <br/> In your slides and script, be sure to use clear, understandable language so you won&rsquo;t end up with an audience full of &ldquo;listeners&rdquo; checking their email. Technical folks may know what you mean by &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/ecmblog/14-acronyms-you-need-to-know-before-researching-ecm/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PGCM  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; but business department heads may not. And if they can&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying, you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p><p> To avoid this problem, ask colleagues from other departments to listen to your presentation and let you know any terms you should define or eliminate.

As companies grow and plan assets increase, formalizing the committee structure makes more sense.</p><p> Depending on plan size, you might even consider helping your clients form one committee to oversee the administration of the plan, and another to oversee the investment responsibilities required. Some companies will often form a third committee for decisions that are considered &ldquo;settlor functions&rdquo; (company and/or business related decisions which are not subject to a fiduciary standard of care).</p><p> <img alt=\"401k committee oversight chart from the 401k best practices blog\" src=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/oversight-chart.png\"/></p><p> The following information provides a framework for helping your clients set up a formal governance process.  When available, I&rsquo;ve included links to sample documents mentioned.</p><h3> Best Practices for 401k Committees <br/>  </h3><p> Forming an investment committee is optional and each committee set-up should be structured around the company&rsquo;s capabilities and needs.</p><p> That being said, here are some basic suggestions for setting up and running an effective committee.</p><li> Committee Demographics: When setting up an investment committee, members are most often senior management personnel from the areas of human resources, finance, and operations.</li><li> Committee Requirements: There is no specific job title or experience requirement for an effective committee member.  However, it is essential that members are willing to fully understand the roles and responsibilities of the position, and commit to working together in the best interest of the plan participants and their beneficiaries.</li><li> Committee Understanding: Each member should be educated on the basics of ERISA including fiduciary duties, plan procedures, investment review guidelines, and plan documents.</li><li> Size of Committee: Five to seven members are optimal. It becomes difficult to get anything accomplished with too many members and with too few, there is not enough perspective. Having an odd number helps prevent voting ties.</li><li> Frequency of Meetings: Committees generally meet quarterly, unless the situation warrants more frequent or less frequent meetings.</li><li> Committee Structure: It&rsquo;s a best practice to appoint a Chairman to run the meeting and a Secretary responsible for keeping  <u>  minutes </u>  and serving as the official custodian of the plan documents and committee records.</li><li> Formalization: Formalizing the committee is important to outline the responsibilities of all members and investment fiduciaries and is typically done through the use of a document such as a committee charter or committee by-laws.</li><li> Fiduciary Acknowledgement: All committee members should acknowledge their appointment to the committee and fiduciary status in writing, if they have voting rights on the committee.</li><li> Documentation Practices: Meeting minutes should be documented including any decisions voted on and documentation should include what items were evaluated and reviewed when making decisions.</li><li> Consistency: An  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.401khelpcenter.com/401k/plan_committee_annual_agenda.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   agenda should be followed  </a> </u>  for each meeting to provide consistent process for reviewing key items. <br/>  </li><p> Regardless of whether a company sets up a formal committee or not, a basic set of guidelines can help plan fiduciaries understand their roles and help ensure participants&rsquo; interests are put first in all plan decisions.</p><h3> Fiduciary Formalization Flow Chart <br/>  </h3><p> The following flow chart follows a process that can help plan fiduciaries understand, formalize, and manage their responsibilities with documentation that demonstrates the decision-making process.</p><p> <img alt=\"best practices for 401k committees\" src=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/best-practice-flow-chart.png\"/></p><p> This chart can be summed up in three steps:</p><li> Identify all fiduciaries and have them acknowledge this position in writing.</li><li> Create a formal process for helping fiduciaries understand and document their responsibilities.</li><li> Ensure committee members engage in a proactive, organized process that is documented. <br/>  </li><p> If you can help your 401k clients with the steps outlined above, they&rsquo;ll be better prepared to demonstrate the prudent management and oversight of their plan.</p><h3> Additional Resources <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"The committee formalization packet is an example of 401k best practices for 401k committees\" src=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/committepacket-230x300.png\"/> <br/> The  documents listed in the flow chart (indicated in black words in parentheses) are all available through FSS, a division of fi360, Inc., in the 401k Service Solution Document Kits.

{"original_id":2069,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Business Culture: Don't Underestimate Its Importance","link":"business-culture-dont-underestimate-its-importance","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Business culture: know about it, and just as important, don&rsquo;t underestimate its importance.</p><p> I read an interesting article in Harvard Business Review (Pisano; June 2015) about the need for better strategies in executing innovation in organizations. While the article has some great recommendations, it ignores one critical element of innovation: the importance of a business culture that nurtures the creative environment.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s one way I could explain &ldquo;business culture.&rdquo; And, forgive me; I do like to use the &ldquo;shipping&rdquo; metaphor. So, let&rsquo;s pretend that Ship A and Ship B have been given the assignment to go find a new route to some new place that will bring in lots of money. Ship A is run by a captain that seeks perfection, that likes to follow the path that other ships have taken before, and will not think about the point when his crew has reached the &ldquo;fork in the sea,&rdquo; and has to tell the guy who steers the ship which way to turn. Throughout this voyage, he has taken the safe route, has not considered the idea that taking a new route entirely may be the best way to go. He may either doubt his ability to lead in some way, or does not have the ability to think outside the box. I&rsquo;m not feeling too good about Ship A&rsquo;s chances.</p><p> Now, Ship B is run by a captain who is excited at this assignment. Has reviewed the routes that have been taken before, understands that maybe, just maybe, a whole new route may be the key to success. She understands the risks, has had a meeting with her crew, and has inspired them to join her, full speed ahead. And, in the long run, she not only finds a sailable route to fortune, but has also discovered new islands along the way, and new countries to trade with. I like this Captain.</p><p> So, the business that fosters an environment to take risks will see more innovation. It may also see some ideas that sink in the water, but without the inclination to seek something new and which benefits its customers, businesses grow stale, and eventually obsolete. Innovations arise from the freedom to explore rather than excessive planning and irritations.</p><p> Pisano&rsquo;s article on innovation ignores some critical cultural components.</p><li> Quite simply a great strategy without a supportive culture will fail. For example, it is clear that many innovations are developed by staff who exhibit deviant behavior. Managing them must be a priority.</li><li> Similarly many innovations will fail at first and organizations like Google which focus on learning from mistakes are more equipped to manage the mistakes. (Like the Captain on Ship A, his tendency to take the well-worn route has prevented him from learning from mistakes, and thus, becoming a better Captain.) <br/>  </li><p> Not only should a business owner commit to a culture of innovation and, for that matter, excellent customer service, he should create a culture that encourages it and supports it. For example:</p><li> Do companies really care about their customers and get excited when a customer has a great experience?</li><li> Many companies treat employees like expendable pieces of the machine, which leads to chaos in the job market.</li><li> Is there trust between management and staff? This requires hiring and training good people, giving them the authority they need to do their jobs well, and understanding that they will make mistakes at times &mdash; mistakes that need correction and not just a reprimand.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-13 18:12:28.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-13 18:12:28.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_IGF8xnV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/business-culture-dont-underestimate-its-importance/\", \"post_id\": \"4702\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-13 18:12:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-13 18:12:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"business-culture-dont-underestimate-its-importance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4701\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2102\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lincolnbusinessschool1.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"481\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436878800,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}

Here are eight disadvantages to relying on a 360 review process:</p><h3> 1. Focus on the Individual</h3><p> In a world that increasingly values collaborative work and project teams, 360-degree reviews are out of sync because they measure individual performance.  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2001/01/getting-360-degree-feedback-right/ar/1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Maury Peiperl  </a> </u> , a researcher from Cranfield University in England, found in his research that both high-performing and low-performing teams are unenthusiastic about peer appraisal systems for that reason. He notes that &ldquo;if most work is done in groups, focusing on individuals can compromise the group&rsquo;s performance or make a weak team&rsquo;s performance even worse.&rdquo; If the bulk of an employee&rsquo;s work is collaborative, it makes more sense to evaluate the group performance, rather than focusing on the individual.</p><h3> 2. No follow-up</h3><p> Feedback without follow-up is useless, something that&rsquo;s true of all performance reviews.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/08/17/the-7-reasons-why-360-degree-feedback-programs-fail/\" target=\"_blank\">   Eric Jackson  </a> </u> , the founder of Ironfire Capital LLC and a management expert, notes that &ldquo;360 data is only helpful to the extent that it gets acted upon and used. The majority of programs we see simply give the feedback and then it gets swiftly forgotten.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the sheer number of people involved in the review process and the frequency of the review cycle limits the possibility for follow-up. An employee might read the feedback they receive, hit delete, and give it no more thought.</p><h3> 3. Personality Over Performance</h3><p> While crowdsourced feedback can be helpful in understanding an employee&rsquo;s complete performance, it&rsquo;s inherently flawed because it&rsquo;s not coming from people trained to evaluate other people. Often, survey questions elicit opinion-based answers rather than performance-based responses, so personality problems can worm their way into a performance review. Coworkers who are competitive could exploit the review to complain about issues that aren&rsquo;t necessarily related to an employee&rsquo;s performance or development. Employees who don&rsquo;t like a manager&rsquo;s leadership style may use the review as an avenue to seek retribution. In either case, the review favors personality-related comments over performance-related feedback.</p><h3> 4. Poorly Structured Reviews</h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/10/the-fatal-flaw-with-360-survey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marcus Buckingham  </a> </u> , an expert on performance management, underscores a structural problem with 360 reviews. Most 360 reviews rely on a similar formula: creating a set of competencies and behaviors, then rating the employee on those aspects of their performance. Buckingham argues that asking reviewers to consider common statements like &ldquo;this employee sets a clear vision for the team&rdquo; actually results in subjective data because the reviewer invariably ends up comparing themselves to the person being reviewed. Each rater brings their individual biases into the process, skewing the data in different directions.</p><h3> 5. Lack of Context</h3><p> Workplace culture matters when it comes to reviews. If problems are endemic to your culture, this might surface in reviews, which become less about the employee and more about the mood of the company. For example, in a company where rounds of layoffs have lowered morale, a supervisor might be negatively reviewed by subordinates who feel the supervisor isn&rsquo;t doing enough to prevent layoffs, even if that&rsquo;s beyond the person&rsquo;s power. Management consultant  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/your-360-degree-feedback-survey-is-probably-wrong/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dave Logan  </a> </u>  suggests assessing your work environment first and feeling secure in that assessment before embarking on a 360-degree feedback survey.</p><h3> 6. No Ownership</h3><p> Because the 360-degree review process involves so many stakeholders by definition, no one person or department takes ownership of the process. Even if the human resources department is overseeing the rollout of the survey, they can&rsquo;t be expected to follow up with every single employee. This seriously hampers the effectiveness of the review to act as a development tool, giving it the feel of a one-time pulse check.</p><h3> 7. Unmeasurable Success</h3><p> Unlike annual (or semiannual) performance reviews issued by a direct supervisor, 360 reviews aren&rsquo;t structured for goal setting, meaning there&rsquo;s no real way to measure an employee&rsquo;s success in addressing shortcomings or surpassing expectations from a previous review cycle. Unless there&rsquo;s someone who is sitting down with each employee and comparing multiple sets of reviews over time, the reviews are essentially disconnected from any goals the employee may have in the same time period. More than likely, the reviewers have no insight into what the employee wanted to accomplish &mdash; and are only rating the employee on what they did, not what they had set out to do.</p><h3> 8. Time-Consuming Process</h3><p> Snapshot data can be helpful in capturing trends, but 360-degree reviews are a lengthy process. Asking five or more people per employee to fill out a survey adds up over time, especially if reviews are given multiple times in a year. Moreover, the review&rsquo;s value diminishes if it&rsquo;s not a tool that produces measurable results and helps develop employees.</p><p> While traditional supervisor-to-subordinate reviews do get a bad rap from employees, you may want to think before you switch over to a totally crowdsourced format. Peer-to-peer appraisal can have a place in your review process, but these time-consuming, subjective, and loosely structured surveys don&rsquo;t necessarily produce results that managers can use to develop and motivate employees. They also don&rsquo;t measure the true indicators of performance that employees say they want in a review. While employees might be happier to get feedback from multiple sources in the short term, these crowdsourced reviews will hurt them and your organization in the long run.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-13 18:07:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-13 18:07:51.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_5bmREmP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-glaring-reasons-why-360-performance-reviews-flop/\", \"post_id\": \"4700\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-13 18:07:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-13 18:07:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-glaring-reasons-why-360-performance-reviews-flop\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4699\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2101\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/expert_advice_for_delivering_a_bad_performance_review_to_an_employee.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"642\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436882400,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2067,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Seven Deadly Sins of Client Advisors","link":"the-seven-deadly-sins-of-client-advisors","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Executives tell me it&rsquo;s not easy to find an advisor with the right balance of experience, expertise, relationship skills, and client orientation. That&rsquo;s not surprising. It&rsquo;s a difficult role to pull off well. There are also lots of bad habits that professionals fall into when it comes to serving clients. </p><p> Here are seven types of ineffective advisors that I regularly spot. These are not black-and-white distinctions. Someone could have, for example, characteristics of several of the types.</p><p> You may not fully match one of these specific descriptions, but ask yourself: Do you ever commit any of these sins?</p><p> 1.  <strong>  Agenda-pushers. </strong> These are professionals who are focused on what theywant and need rather than on the client&rsquo;s agenda. Basically, they are product salespeople. Many historical advisors diminished their stature and effectiveness by pushing an agenda of personal power and influence. Think former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, advisor to Richard Nixon. Remember, one of the main drives of trust is the client&rsquo;s perception that you are truly working  their  agenda, not  your  agenda.</p><p> 2.  <strong>  One-size-fits-all. </strong> A CEO I knew once told me this: &ldquo;Many professionals find one good solution and then apply it to  every  client, to every situation. By way of illustration&mdash;I had a friend who got a job as a printer&rsquo;s helper in college, and then started his own printing business. He&rsquo;s a very bright, engaging guy. But for him, the solution to everything is a brochure. If you tell him you&rsquo;ve got problems with your computer, he&rsquo;ll enthusiastically say to you, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s put together a pamphlet.&rsquo;&rdquo; One-size-fits-all advisors are hammers looking for nails.</p><p> 3.  <strong>  Gurus. </strong> Gurus are the academics, authors, and consultants who get anointed as visionaries. They are perceived to have a set of hot, leading-edge ideas and they market them from coast to coast in speeches and seminars. Their brilliant framework&mdash;not the clients real need or problem&mdash;is the center of focus. I once interviewed Reginald Jones, the former head of General Electric and the man who put Jack Welch in the CEO role there in 1981. He commented to me, &ldquo;I have never really fallen for the gurus. I avoided them entirely. They come in with all the slogans and the buzzwords, they give a spellbinding lecture, and they disappear. Two days later, you can&rsquo;t remember anything they said that you can really use in the organization. The outstanding professionals, in contrast, offer advice and insights that are more specific and practical. They address your context.&rdquo;</p><p> 4.  <strong>  Crowd-pleasers. </strong> These are the advisors who tell their clients exactly what they want to hear. They lack integrity, conviction, and independence. They are like one of the protagonists in the joke about the wildlife biologist who goes to a small town in the Rockies to study mountain lions. In the general store, he asks the clerk if he&rsquo;s ever seen any mountain lions around the town. &ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo; the clerk replies, seeking to reassure the stranger.</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; says the biologist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come out here from Boston to study them, and was hoping to stay awhile.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; the clerk tells him, hoping he&rsquo;ll stay, &ldquo;I saw a big one just last night near my house.&rdquo;</p><p> Think about the accountants and consultants and investment bankers who were advising Enron during their heyday. They told Jeff Skilling at Enron exactly what he wanted to hear, and they reaped huge amounts of business as a result.</p><p> 5.  <strong>  Crowd-followers. </strong> One CEO said to me, &ldquo;A good outside advisor is someone who is really thinking on the edge, who will challenge the status quo and be willing to go against the crowd.&rdquo; Out of insecurity, lack of imagination, or just plain conservatism, however, some professionals always advise their clients to go withthe crowd, and they stick to preconceived notions about the right solution.</p><p> A friend of mine, who was a top executive at a leading brokerage firm in the 1990s, recently told me a story about crowd-followers in the financial advice industry: &ldquo;During the 1990s, the online discount brokers like Charles Schwab and eTrade grew rapidly as the Internet boom accelerated. The strategy consulting firms all made the rounds with the exact same presentation, exhorting every major broker&mdash;Merrill, Paine Webber, etc.&mdash;to invest hundreds of millions in building online trading platforms. It turned out to be wrong advice. In fact, as soon as Schwab&rsquo;s customers had any amount of money, they wanted more personal service and advice and often turned to a traditional, in-person financial advisor. The real answer was to invest in strengthening client relationships and use online tools and a Web presence to augment them, not creating a whole separate online trading business.&rdquo;</p><p> 6.  <strong>  Recyclers. </strong> Clients want services tailored to their particular situation, not recycled, boilerplate advice. Polonius, who advises the king and queen in Shakespeare&rsquo;s  Hamlet , is a classic example of the advisor who offers stale, clich&eacute;d counsel. Spouting platitudes such as &ldquo;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&rdquo; and &ldquo;Above all, to thine own self be true,&rdquo; he exposes his own shallowness and lack of insight. Polonius recycles the same silly advice over and over.</p><p> A few years ago, a well-known consulting firm had been asked by a dozen different clients to study their affirmative action and diversity policies, and make recommendations. Two of the clients happened to compare the reports they were given, only to find them virtually identical&mdash;down to the specific recommendations, which were supposed to be tailored for each client. A reporter&rsquo;s subsequent investigation surfaced the fact that all of the reports were essentially the same. The clients were furious.</p><p> 7.  <strong>  Power Grabbers. </strong> Some advisors try to usurp their client&rsquo;s power and prestige for themselves. Even though they are supposed to be behind-the-scenes counselors&mdash;in the wings, not stage-center&mdash;they use their relationship with their senior client to enhance their own fame. Henry Kissinger used to do this famously with former President Richard Nixon when he was Nixon&rsquo;s national security advisor. He would frequently invoke the president&rsquo;s name and say things like &ldquo;The president is fully behind this&rdquo; to bolster his own position. When the two of them landed in Beijing for their historic visit to China in 1972, one person on Air Force One reported that Kissinger tried to exit the plane alongside Nixon rather than behind him with other senior officials, and he had to practically be blocked from the doorway until the president had appeared on the stairs.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-13 17:53:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-13 17:53:39.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_mxMf0Rh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-client-advisors/\", \"post_id\": \"4696\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-13 17:53:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-13 17:53:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-seven-deadly-sins-of-client-advisors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4695\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2099\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1434077471918-4ea96e6e45d5-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"717\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436870700,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2065,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Money Is Better Than Poverty","link":"money-is-better-than-poverty","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;Money is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons&rdquo;   Woody Allen</p><p> We live in a world where money makes things happen. But money isn&rsquo;t good or bad, it&rsquo;s simply a tool&mdash;that can be used for good or wasteful or downright harmful reasons. It can lift you up and provide freedom or enslave you and create misery.</p><p> Like the lottery winner who is suddenly burdened with decisions and pressures they were never equipped to handle. The result? Typically frivolous spending, relatives springing out of the woodwork with their hands out and every variety of scam artist looking to part them from what should be a positive life-changing event. </p><p> Most of us are fortunate enough to live in a society where you can&mdash;with hard work, some luck and resilience&mdash;make money and create a stable life. You view money as a tool, a means to feed your family, educate your children and provide a stream of income in retirement.  But there are those that have taken the idea of &ldquo;enough&rdquo; to extremes beyond logic or reason, while others remain stuck in a cycle of poverty and want.</p><p> Money was invented as a medium of exchange for goods and services, not as a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Pulling out your wallet and handing over some cash is much easier than trying to figure out how many pounds of coffee a goat is worth.</p><p> Living in peace with your money is all about your values. The adage about &ldquo;he who dies with the most tools wins&rdquo; is obnoxious and patently untrue. I have never spoken with a person in a nursing home who cared one bit about the balance in their accounts or how many Renoirs are on their wall. They care about the footprint they are leaving behind, the relationships, experiences and love in their lives. They talk about regrets of not devoting more time with those they love. No one wishes they spent more time in the office.</p><p> In a world where the line between &ldquo;need&rdquo; and &ldquo;want&rdquo; has been blurred beyond recognition, it is difficult to define values. No one NEEDS a 110-inch Ultra HDTV. But it makes sports fans and movie lovers salivate at the prospect of hangin&rsquo; that baby on the wall and it only costs $40,000. Gotta have it&mdash;right now.</p><p> Leading a values-based life around money means you look beyond your circumstances and raise the viewpoint more globally to your vision of long-term success. The richest guy in a sinking boat will drown just as quickly as the guy rowing it. Civilizations self-destructed because of callous greed and the focus on accumulating more money, power and influence to the detriment of society as a whole. How can one be a member of society and yet strive to be a society of one?</p><p> Earning money is important for your sense of self and accomplishment and the ability to provide for your family. But money is not a goal nor is it a value. It provides choices, independence, security and mobility. Values cling closely to the concept of relationships, love, and self-fulfillment.

When my foot touched the curb on the other side, something happened that is embossed in my memory forever.  I put my hand in my pocket and felt a little more than a dollar&rsquo;s worth of change, clinking like little soothsayers beneath my fingers.  Oh my&hellip;  The realization washed over me like a cold fog.  I  lied  to a  homeless  person.  Does it get any worse than that?!</p><p> I&rsquo;m not proud of this story.

Many books have been written about their culture, and yet I knew that during my friend&rsquo;s tenure at the company she had been miserable.  When I asked her about it &ndash; why the discrepancy between what I&rsquo;ve read about the organization and her experience &ndash; she said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true at the store-level.  At corporate, it&rsquo;s a different story.  Behind the scenes the same rules don&rsquo;t apply.&rdquo;</p><p> I could share countless other stories that I&rsquo;ve heard from friends and participants (or participants who have become friends), about values-driven organizations that have bullies at the helm, about bosses who tout the virtues of transparency only to blind-side their teams, about departments that invest in emotional intelligence training for their employees but show little or no empathy during layoffs, about people-centered companies that treat their vendors like second-class citizens, the list goes on.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no wonder that cynicism seems to be at an all-time high, loyalty at an all-time low, and that more than 70% of American workers are not engaged (according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/181289/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of the American Workplace  </a> </u> ).

There&rsquo;s not a perfect person on this planet and certainly not a perfect organization, but the price we pay for incongruencies is often bigger than we realize.  It&rsquo;s easy to see that when others sense incongruency that they won&rsquo;t trust us &ndash; won&rsquo;t want to do business with us.  But what if others don&rsquo;t know?

Five years ago I removed my consulting shingle from the home office wall. Am I happy in the CEO afterlife? You bet. I&rsquo;m busy pursuing other dreams that are inspirational and meaningful. So why, you might ask, would I come out of retirement and accept a temporary assignment in the C-suite of a business in America.</p><p> Some might say the idea of living on the beach in southern California in place of the chilly Canadian winter was simply irresistible. I&rsquo;ll gladly admit that this was the tipping point. But I must also confess that I could not resist the challenge and the opportunity to make an impact.</p><p> I finished my assignment in the spring of 2012 and I&rsquo;m back in the CEO afterlife. For retired executives considering returning to the fast lanes, I offer 7 insights from my experience.</p><p> <strong>  1. You&rsquo;ve still got the juice.  </strong> <br/> Oh yes, the times have changed, but the inner drive that helped me motivate others, and propel organizations to excel, quickly bubbled to the surface. No matter one&rsquo;s age, there are plenty of ways and means to stir the senses.</p><p> <strong>  2. Cutting to the chase.  </strong> <br/> Despite the anomalies of a different industry (this one was fresh food), I was able to assess the situation in short order and define a course of action, always mindful of understanding the company/industry&rsquo;s key success factors before leveraging them for marketplace differentiation.</p><p> <strong>  3. Technically, you may be woefully inept.  </strong> <br/> I expected to be out of touch with technology and this was glaringly obvious. But as an acting C-suite executive, I managed to stick to proven leadership and strategic principles while seeking the technical counsel of others in execution. Thankfully, the age wedge never reared its ugly head. The millennial generation was keen to help.</p><p> <strong>  4. Strategically, you are in the game.  </strong> <br/> All this talk about the new economy, the social network, and how business is different today hasn&rsquo;t devalued the need for smart strategic thinking. Strategic thinking and strategic focus has never been more important. But, sadly, in 21st century business, strategy is taking a back seat.</p><p> <strong>  5. Don&rsquo;t forget that business is 24/7.  </strong> <br/> This was my biggest shock. The business issues were with me as I dozed off to sleep, when I woke in the night, even during those glorious California weekends. I&rsquo;d forgotten that. Conclusion: this comes with the territory.</p><p> <strong>  6. Therapy for the mind.  </strong> <br/> Like most things in life, change (with a purpose) is good for you. In this particular case, I had the opportunity to teach, to learn, and to grow. For that, I am thankful.</p><p> <strong>  7. You will be happy to be back in the business afterlife.  </strong> <br/> The experience was immeasurable, but my days of calling the shots are over. In my business life, I was at my best in my forties. Having lived the CEO afterlife for 7 years now, I&rsquo;ve discovered new horizons, and I&rsquo;m pursuing them with the same passion that motivated me to push my competitors into retreat on the corporate battlefield.</p><h3> The bottom line?</h3><p> <br/> On a temporary basis, there is little downside to retirees re-entering the work force. So, if you wish to re-instate your career, be aware that you are not the person you were in your heyday, in fact, in most ways you&rsquo;re BETTER, and you&rsquo;ve still got it in you to further your legacy and the legacy of others.</p> ","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-13 17:13:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-13 17:13:47.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Zvkg7pe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/retired-7-insights-on-getting-back-in-the-game/\", \"post_id\": \"4688\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-13 17:13:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-13 17:13:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"retired-7-insights-on-getting-back-in-the-game\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4687\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2095\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436459826008-8fd497f03742-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"655\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436889600,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2062,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Could Student Loan Debt Reduce My Social Security Payments?","link":"could-student-loan-debt-reduce-my-social-security-payments","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Do you think American's have more outstanding credit card debt or student loan debt? </strong> If you said student loan debt you would be correct! In fact, as of April 2014, American's had $1.12 Trillion in student loan debt compared to $854 billion in credit card debt. <strong>  That's 31% more student loan debt than credit card debt! </strong> <br/> <br/> It is also important to know however that not all debt is created equal. One important difference between credit card debt and student loan debt is that credit card debt is extinguished in bankruptcy but student loan debt is not. <strong>  Student loan debt doesn't die until you do! </strong> <br/> <br/> So what does any of this have to do with social security benefits? Well, as it turns out, if you have delinquent Federal student loan debt, your social security benefits can be reduced until that student loan debt is paid off. <br/> <br/> And it is not limited to delinquent student loan debt. There are over 30 Federal programs, in addition to the Federal student loan program, that participate in this Federal debt recapture program of delinquent Federal debt whereby social security benefit payments are reduced until the debt is paid off. Examples of other Federal programs include home loan's owed to the Veteran's Administration (VA) and food stamp overpayments owed to the Food and Nutrition Service etc. <br/> <br/> Social Security participates in a program called Benefit Payment Offset or BPO.  The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) authorized BPO. DCIA requires Federal-disbursing agencies to offset Federal payments to collect delinquent \"non-tax\" debts owed to the Federal government. Therefore, delinquent Federal debts, excluding taxes owed to the IRS, are handled by BPO. The collection of delinquent taxes is handled separately by the IRS. <br/> <br/> BPO applies when someone who is receiving Social Security benefits owes money to another federal agency.  The amount owed to the other federal agency is transmitted to Social Security and it is then withheld from the Social Security beneficiary's benefits.  The transfer of funds due is handled by BFS, which is part of the Department of Treasury.  They send three letters to the debtor - one 60 days in advance, one 30 days in advance and one when the recovery begins. <br/> <br/> BFS determines the offset amount. It is the least of: <br/> <br/> a.  the amount of the debt; or <br/> b. an amount equal to 15% of the monthly benefit payment (MBP); or <br/> c. the amount by which the Monthly Benefit Payment exceeds $750. <br/> <br/> By law, BPO will not reduce benefit payments below $750 per month. Therefore, social security beneficiaries who have been identified by the BPO process as delinquent debtors will still receive a minimum $750/month. <br/> <br/> If more than one debt is owed to a Federal agency or agencies, the policy is to collect the oldest debt first. Once the oldest debt is paid off collection will proceed with the next oldest debt and so on until all outstanding Federal debts are collected. <br/> <br/> As the Federal government continues to struggle with managing the growing costs of their numerous entitlement programs there is a growing focus to recoup outstanding delinquent debts wherever they may be in the system. With the advent of technology and a focus on debt collection the social security system is just one more mechanism to recoup these debts. <br/> <br/> One important way to ensure you receive all the social security benefits that you are entitled to is to ensure you pay off all outstanding Federal debt prior to filing for you social security benefits. For most Americans, the ability to pay for expenses in retirement is challenging enough. The last thing you need is to have your social security benefits reduced due to delinquent Federal debt.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-13 17:12:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-13 17:12:34.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_irxOkgO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/could-student-loan-debt-reduce-my-social-security-payments/\", \"post_id\": \"4686\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-13 17:12:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-13 17:12:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"could-student-loan-debt-reduce-my-social-security-payments\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4685\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2094\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/student_debt_cc_img.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"795\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436877000,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}

The decision came on the heels of the high court&rsquo;s 2013 ruling against sections of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a ruling that made Social Security benefits available to gay and lesbian couples in states that permitted them to marry.</p><p> In the wake of these decisions, &ldquo;If marriage is an option and it makes sense emotionally for the couple, that&rsquo;s also the best financial strategy,&rdquo; said Sheryl Garrett, a certified financial planner in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.</p><h3> There are disadvantages to marrying. </h3><p> <br/> Filing joint tax returns can mean higher income taxes or less financial aid for college-bound offspring. Nevertheless, Garrett, co-author of &ldquo;Money without Matrimony: The Unmarried Couple&rsquo;s Guide to Financial Security,&rdquo; said the court rulings together make a compelling argument for marrying.</p><p> She provided Squared Away with five financial benefits of same-sex marriage listed below. They&rsquo;re the same advantages that were always available to heterosexual couples who could produce a marriage license.</p><li> <strong>  Social Security benefits. </strong>  Unmarried gay couples often go through contortions to set up trusts and purchase life insurance to ensure that, if they die, an unmarried partner or their non-biological children are taken care of.  This is typically their replacement for Social Security&rsquo;s standard spousal, survivor, and related benefits available to married couples. <br/>   <br/> Now that same-sex couples in every state can marry, Social Security benefits will become available to more people. In fact, in Massachusetts and other New England states where same-sex marriage has been legal for years, the U.S. Social Security Administration is already &ldquo;processing some spousal and related benefits for same-sex couples and paying benefits where they&rsquo;re due,&rdquo; said Stephen Richardson, the agency&rsquo;s spokesman in Boston. He encouraged same-sex couples who believe they may be eligible to apply for benefits as soon as possible.</li><li> <strong>  Unlimited marital transfer. </strong>  All unmarried couples are subject to federal gift taxes when they transfer real estate, 401(k)s or other valuable assets from one partner to another.  Married couples &ldquo;don&rsquo;t even have to think about it,&rdquo; Garrett said, due to a federal provision that permits unlimited transfers between marital partners if both are U.S. citizens; states often have similar rules. Similarly, federal and state inheritance taxes don&rsquo;t apply when a married spouse dies and leaves assets to a survivor.</li><li> <strong>  Joint and survivor benefits. </strong>  Defined-benefit (DB) employer pensions are rapidly disappearing from the U.S. retirement system.  But many baby boomers still have these benefits, which, if they die, provide pensions that will carry on for their marital spouses. The Supreme Court Ruling is expected to make DB survivor benefits available to married gay and lesbian couples.</li><li> <strong>  Health insurance. </strong>  A majority of Fortune 500 companies offer health insurance to unmarried employees with same-sex partners, but small companies often do not.  Many unmarried couples have to purchase a second individual policy if one partner lacks employer health coverage. <br/>   <br/> A same-sex couple who marries can now switch to an employer&rsquo;s family plan and will generally pay much less in total premiums, since employer plans have lower administrative costs, less adverse selection, and are typically subsidized by the employer. Now that same-sex marriage is legal, some employers are  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/your-money/fate-of-domestic-partner-benefits-in-question-after-marriage-ruling.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  eliminating benefits </a>  for some same-sex partners and returning to a two-tiered system in which employees must declare themselves either married or single.</li><li> <strong>  Save on financial and tax planning. </strong>  Unmarried same-sex partners can run up large bills for the complex financial and legal documentation needed in their attempts to replicate married couples&rsquo; arrangements. The Supreme Court ruling won&rsquo;t eliminate all of these complexities.  But many same-sex couples will save hundreds of dollars in financial planning and legal fees now that they are on an equal footing with all married couples.</li><p> <br/> In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling, Garrett said, life &ldquo;will be a lot simpler&rdquo; for couples who marry.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-13 16:58:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-13 16:58:14.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_i6DWMGU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/financial-bonus-of-same-sex-marriage/\", \"post_id\": \"4684\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-13 16:58:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-13 16:58:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"financial-bonus-of-same-sex-marriage\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4683\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2093\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1435954825382-b3a18dc888f3-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"636\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436893200,"author_id":280,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2060,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Getting To Grips With 'Dark Social'","link":"getting-to-grips-with-dark-social","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Dark Social. No it&rsquo;s not the name of a scary new Star Wars baddy for the digital age. It&rsquo;s actually a term that's being bandied about by marketers more and more nowadays. But what does it actually mean? Is it as terrifying as it sounds?</p><p> Various recent articles have shed some - yes, you guessed it - light on the subject. It's an extremely relevant subject for B2B marketers (Forbes Magazine describes it as &ldquo;the dominant force in online sharing\") so I thought I'd examine some of the key aspects in today&rsquo;s post.</p><p> In basic terms, 'dark social' (a term first used by The Atlantic's Alexis Madrigal) is hidden traffic to your website, where analytics can't determine the exact source from which it arrived.</p><p> Business2Community suggests considering the following scenario: you're on your lunch hour, scrolling down your news feed on Facebook when an article grabs your attention. After reading it (perhaps it's about a product or service) you share it with a co-worker who you think would be interested by copying and pasting the URL into an email and sending it to them privately. By doing so, you've just unwittingly participated in the 'dark social phenomenon', and these under-the-radar shared links can prove extremely hard to track, analytically-speaking.</p><p> RadiumOne has studied dark social inbound traffic in depth and discovered that it accounts for nearly three-quarters (74%) of online sharing activity in the UK! Apps such as WhatsApp and SnapChat are prime examples of platforms through which these links are shared. A staggering 50 billion messages are received through WhatsApp every day, with some sites now even featuring WhatsApp 'share' buttons on their pages. But if you sent someone a link this way, Google Analytics would determine this to be direct traffic to the site.</p><h3> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,h_2000,q_90,w_1200/v1/75010/Dark_Social_s1fjth.jpg\"/> <br/> <br/> Do I hear you ask &ldquo;so what&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> Does it really matter how a link is shared? Well, actually, it really does. When a work colleague or friend, for example, sends you a link to a service or product, these can be considered very strong buying signals indeed. Essentially, they've hand-picked their subject matter and recipient. This type of one-to-one messaging could offer B2Bs numerous opportunities, especially in terms of audience buying intent and interest.</p><h3> By tapping into dark social, businesses could potentially open up whole new areas of social listening.</h3><p> <br/> But how can this be captured and tracked? Well, that's something for the future. It's likely to involve mapping social shares in forensic detail and examining sources using highly sophisticated tracking tools, some of which probably haven't even been invented yet.</p><p> Of course you can&rsquo;t take advantage of any opportunity until you know that it exists...so, hopefully, you're no longer quite so in the dark when it comes to this under-the-radar aspect of social media marketing.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-13 16:45:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-13 16:45:16.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_uHFR6BB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/getting-to-grips-with-dark-social/\", \"post_id\": \"4682\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-13 16:45:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-13 16:45:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"getting-to-grips-with-dark-social\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4681\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2092\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-13-at-9.44.34-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"557\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436900400,"author_id":492,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2057,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Always Be Curious","link":"always-be-curious","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Remember when your kids were little and they asked a zillion questions? What? Why? How? When? It&rsquo;s amazing how direct and focused (and persistent) children can be when they&rsquo;re learning about their environment. Their curiosity is insatiable, and this is a good thing! In fact, I think children have a lot to teach us when we&rsquo;re building business relationships and learning about our business environments. We need to be more curious&mdash;ask more questions&mdash;be more persistent. We tend to be more introspective as adults&hellip; in some ways it serves us, but in others, it holds us back.</p><h3> Here are three ways to use child-like curiosity in developing relationships:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Ask lots of questions: </strong> <br/> We often assume we know enough to jump into conversations when we should have spent more time asking questions and listening to the answers. Ask people how they&rsquo;re doing and don&rsquo;t think about what you&rsquo;re going to say next&mdash;really listen to what they say! When you&rsquo;re connecting with someone online for the first time, dig into their profile and write down some questions that will give you a deeper insight. When you&rsquo;re at a networking event, pretend you&rsquo;re a newspaper reporter looking for a story and ask who, what, where, when and how questions (again, don&rsquo;t think about your own story&mdash;your goal is to find out other people&rsquo;s stories). The more you know, the more helpful you can be.</p><p> <strong>  Be open to new experiences:  </strong> <br/> Watch kids at play and you&rsquo;ll notice that when they get together in a group, they&rsquo;re ready for anything. Don&rsquo;t get stuck in a rut or let your comfort zone hold you back from experiencing new things&mdash;be willing to jump in and do something you&rsquo;ve never done before. The most limiting sentence ever uttered is &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve always done it this way.&rdquo; Try a new technology&mdash;experiment with different foods&mdash;learn a new language. Make it a point to try something new once a month, and broaden your horizons. Being willing to try new things makes you more interesting as a person, and helps you be more flexible in relationships.</p><p> <strong>  Allow yourself to dream:  </strong> <br/> We&rsquo;re always encouraging our children to let their imaginations run wild&mdash;yet as adults we stifle that impulse and limit ourselves to the here and now. Dreaming (and/or imagining) is an important function of the human brain. It opens us up to new possibilities, helps us solve problems, and is a way to recharge or reset our systems. Remember those instances as a child when you co-imagined things with a group of friends? It gave you energy, freed your spirit, and spawned creativity.

{"original_id":2056,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Personal is Too Personal?","link":"how-personal-is-too-personal","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Nowadays, I don&rsquo;t think there is much question over the validity and the effectiveness of a personalized approach to branding, marketing and customer experience. But, what I think may still be largely confused is that it&rsquo;s not about a &ldquo;personalized approach,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s actually about being personal. I don&rsquo;t need my phone to beep coupons at me when I get within a 5 mile radius of Home Depot or my web browser to somehow remember my search history and stalk me on every webpage I visit with ads for that item or similar. That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about at all. I&rsquo;m talking about putting the personal in personal branding. Embracing the wholeness of who you are and putting that out there for the world to know and connect with. While it can leave the person sharing of themselves incredibly vulnerable and exposed to criticism&hellip;. it&rsquo;s a risk worth taking, because it helps form a strong bond with an audience and leads to opportunity!  For personal brands and businesses wanting to share a more personal side of who they are, the question that often comes up is how personal is too personal?</p><h3> I think this completely depends on the person or brand, as this is&hellip; as you might expect&hellip; a very personal choice.</h3>As a personal brand myself, I oftentimes struggle not with how personal I want to be, because I really am all of me in all that I do, but want to do so in a way that is meaningful to my audience. I always consider what is going to be most valuable and relevant.  That being said, sometimes inviting an audience into your personal world is exactly the point and is most relevant, especially when it&rsquo;s really a form of relating to your audience and welcoming them to relate to you. I personally believe that when you make it personal for yourself and your audience, you make real, lasting connections that authentically forms trust and friendship &ndash; not just transactions and clients.We can all learn a lot from Taylor Swift and her unrivaled ability to connect with her audience on a deeply personal level on a worldwide scale. She doesn&rsquo;t have millions of fans, she has millions of friends who support her, no matter what, and feel like they know her personally, because she has allowed herself to be known. Through the autobiographical lyrics she writes, to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGVg6gjBJ2w\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  private listening parties </u>  </a>she throws, to how she goes out of her way to <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZefJl3rpTTA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  reach out to a friend individually </a></u>. She loves her fans and they love her back. And you can&rsquo;t have that sort of connection unless you&rsquo;re willing to put it all out there. Now, most of us can&rsquo;t even begin to dream what it would be like to have that sort of loyalty and advocacy for our own brands&hellip; or can we? What does she do that is so different? I think it&rsquo;s obvious: She is 100000% focused on her audience first and is not just committed, she&rsquo;s devoted to them.  Goodness, what if we were all so devoted to our audience? What might we do differently?Well, reaching the bar that our girl Taylor Swift set might seem overwhelming, but I know a couple people that are also great examples of how making it personal is never too personal. I adore them both and even more so the longer I know them. These two professionals share their lives and in doing so bring so much value to the lives they touch by being personal and how they use their experiences to genuinely help others.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/iSocialFanz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/category/sell/content-marketing\"/></a>I can&rsquo;t help but talk about him quite a bit in my writing. <u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iSocialFanz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brian Fanzo </a></u> &ndash; Engineer of Awesomeness &ndash; everything he shares is from his unique and personal perspective. From day one, he has always shared that he is a devoted husband, loving father, change enthusiast, and technology junkie. Even though I have not yet had the pleasure to meet him face-to-face, I feel like I know what he is all about and admire his willingness to take all of us on his journey with him. He takes us everywhere from <u> conferences</u> to his <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Stee1rz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  home office </a></u>. He even takes us on <u> vacation</u> sometimes! Brian can turn almost anything into a teachable moment and takes his real life experiences and shows how we, too, can apply what he&rsquo;s learned to our own lives. Moreover, he shares who he is at home and I love seeing when he posts pictures with his family. He connects with his audience on a human level and I think that is most important of all.<img alt=\"Chris\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/category/sell/content-marketing\"/><u> Carlos Gil</u> - an exceptional person and marketing professional &ndash; is someone who shares his life and perspective. Carlos doesn&rsquo;t shy away from the truth and makes himself available to others and lets his audience in on his journey. Maybe you&rsquo;ve caught his recent announcement about joining the LinkedIn team. If you haven&rsquo;t, <u> you have to check it out</u>. His experience is one so many of us can understand and relate to. He shares his whole story with his audience and by sharing of himself, he not only gives us advice on how we can learn from his path &ndash; he let&rsquo;s us know him better. Just look at everything he has published and you will see that he uses his experience to help others and isn&rsquo;t afraid to talk about what&rsquo;s real and personal (<u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvY5DUqXrQ8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  #SMRealTalk </a></u>). It all matters. Carlos&rsquo;s values come through in what he does and who he is. He also shares pictures of his family and travels and it feels awesome to get to know him better on a personal level. He obviously values his audience enough to let us in. I especially love how he shares his personal reflections via the written word and video. Knowing the context of his story and how much he appreciates the relationships he has is simply incredible to experience. You should be certain to at least <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaU8W38WoDc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  watch this recent video </a></u> of his and you&rsquo;ll know exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about.These two have worked incredibly hard to get to where they are today professionally. What is important to note, is that they didn&rsquo;t get to where they are today, because they colored within the lines, if you will.  They went outside the lines and showed us the whole picture of who they are and what they&rsquo;re all about.  They don&rsquo;t tell us what they do to help others, they are always helping other people and their audience sees it in action all the time. I trust them, not because they tell me I can.  I trust them, because they have allowed me (and others) to get to know them for myself.Wow. Even as I am writing this post, I am so encouraged that real honesty, hard work, and integrity does matter and does help you reach your professional and business goals. I think the point is that you should share your personal experiences to engage with your audience, because it&rsquo;s not just valuable &ndash; it&rsquo;s invaluable. How much is a reputation worth? What is the value of trust? Can you quantify the worth of loyalty? As the famed <u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TedRubin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ted Rubin </a></u> talks about and Brian and Carlos practice: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDPJcdqjTK0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> What is the RonR (return on relationships)</a>?Being personal: It&rsquo;s valuable, because it&rsquo;s real. It&rsquo;s important, because it helps others. It&rsquo;s lasting, because it&rsquo;s built on a foundation of truth&hellip; your truth.<h3> How personal is too personal? That I think you can only find out once you really start putting yourself out there.</h3>While there is no formal prescription for personal branding, here are some things that I try to keep in mind:<li> <li>  <strong>   Be yourself (not a version of yourself)  </strong> </li> <li>  <strong>   Focus on your audience (they matter most)  </strong> </li> <li>  <strong>   Provide value (it&rsquo;s about them, not you)  </strong> </li> <li>  <strong>   Create your own content (write, video)  </strong> </li></li><li> <strong>  Give, then give some more (it&rsquo;s not give to get, it&rsquo;s just give) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Show up (out of sight, out of mind) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Build relationships (be genuinely interested in others) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Care about their experience (with you) </strong></li>As a marketer, the importance of figuring out those lovely &ldquo;key differentiators&rdquo; for a brand is always high on the list. From my experience, I have never met two of the exact same person&hellip; Perhaps we need not look further than inside ourselves and the people within our organizations to see what truly makes us different.Cheers to all of you who live the personal of personal branding and much encouragement to those of you who are ready to take the leap.

They start to believe their whole process is somehow &ldquo;broken&rdquo;, and start to re-invent.</p><p> <strong>  What most want is. </strong></p><li> Just enough of a conversation to demonstrate value and proceed, or quickly identify those not ready to take advice and just want  information (if they slip through the pre-vet net) so you can give it to them.</li><li> A means to easily show clients what you do in a way that has them asking for your help (Buy/Pull engagement, instead of Sell/Push).</li><li> A way of creating momentum that goes beyond the appointment. <br/>  </li><h3> The outcome is always a more efficient conversation and better conversion experience all round.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  If you find yourself stuck with the former frustrations, consider these four &ldquo;tweaks&rdquo; </strong></p><li> Ease up on the enthusiastic rapport. Only three types of people are ultra-friendly. Friends, family and car salespeople. As an adviser, you&rsquo;re none of the three, so you&rsquo;re looking for that comfortable tone that says &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin&hellip;&rdquo; not &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve drunk too much coffee!!!!!!!!&rdquo;</li><li> Let up control of the process. It&rsquo;s important you have a process, but not all clients buy the same way. If you find yourself feeling like you&rsquo;re dragging a client through the experience, it might be worth giving them the option of redefining the agenda upfront and finding out the real, immediate (and often unstated) reason they&rsquo;re here speaking to you. Why now? What&rsquo;s the real problem?</li><li> Is there actually a gap? Have an emotional conversation about the future, rather than just an intellectual one. Uncover the truth about their situation, rather than the version they tell themselves. Help them explore the real gap between the two. If there&rsquo;s a true gap there and you can help them reach their own realisation that current situation + current course of action will not equal desired outcome, then price is very rarely a barrier. If there isn&rsquo;t a gap though, then&hellip;</li><li> Raise the bar on prospects. Don&rsquo;t take just anyone. For 100 reasons I&rsquo;m only to happen to talk about, if you&rsquo;re accepting anyone and everyone it will catch up with your business eventually. Too many advisers start to question whether it&rsquo;s their problem, when it&rsquo;s often simply that they&rsquo;re not seeing people who actually need their help. If the problem is you can&rsquo;t find them, then you&rsquo;re got a marketing and attraction problem, not a conversion issue. <br/>  </li><p> Obviously, there&rsquo;s more to it than just these four tweaks. Other issues can arise when you&rsquo;re not asking for a decision, rushing your meeting conclude, only using conversational means to engage or not outlining your advice &ldquo;prescriptions&rdquo;.</p><p> However, these four are a good place to start if you find yourself wondering how to convert better.</p><p> What are some of the tweaks you may have made to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; your first appointment process?

{"original_id":2054,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"RIAs: It's Time to Understand Your Next Big Client","link":"rias-its-time-to-understand-your-next-big-client","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/author/lkatsanis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leah Katsanis  </a> </u> Ninety-two million strong, millennials have become a force to be reckoned with. As the baby boomers phase out, RIAs need to make serious strides in understanding this up-and-coming group. The good news is that the opportunities are endless, especially considering that this cohort has surpassed the baby boomers by  <u>  <a href=\"/category/research/human-behavior\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   15 million  </a> </u>  and now represents America&rsquo;s largest living generation.For this reason, the millennial imperative can no longer be ignored. If RIAs want to build and ensure sustainable businesses, they need to make it a point to understand this Facebook-updating, Periscope-ing generation that now makes up approximately  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.millennialmarketing.com/who-are-millennials/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   25 percent of the U.S.  </a> </u>  population. How could a business survive if they ignored a quarter of their customers?So, RIAs, how well do you know your next big client? Read on to find out, as we dissect five common millennial myths.</p><h3> Millennials are not benefiting from their college degrees.</h3>Did you know that college-educated millennials are making higher salaries than the general population? Or that over <u> <a href=\"https://www.tiaainstitute.org/sites/default/files/presentations/2017-02/gflec_overview_millennials_personal_finances_feb2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  60 percent of millennials </a></u> are making more than $50,000 a year compared to 50 percent nationally? To boot, most millennials have even established a retirement plan with their employer. Sure, the alums in Generation Y were off to a rocky start post-recession, but they&rsquo;ve come a long way since then. There are only brighter days ahead, too, as more than <u> <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2015/04/15/hiring-heats-up-for-the-class-of-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">  one-third </a></u> of employers plan on hiring even more new graduates this fall.<h3> Millennials spend more money on luxuries and do not care about saving.</h3>Millennials carry a stigma of frivolous spending, whether it&rsquo;s for new cars, designer clothing or other luxury items. However, in reality, the majority of millennials are practicing prudent saving habits and putting off large commitments such as marriage and car payments to save for their future. RIAs need to accommodate this shift in demographics to understand millennial spending habits and advise them on ways to best meet their savings goals.<h3> Millennials are less likely to invest in stocks and bonds.</h3>RIAs may be thinking, &ldquo;Why bother trying to land millennials as clients if they&rsquo;re not investing in what I&rsquo;m offering?&rdquo; Despite popular belief, millennials are very interested in expanding their portfolios. In fact, nearly two-fifths of millennials currently have investments in stocks, bonds and mutual funds, which is more than the average number of Americans who have these same investments. In addition to investing more, millennials are also diversifying their portfolios more than older generations with equities that they are passionate about.<h3> Millennials buy more spontaneously without doing as much background research.</h3>Millennials have received a bad reputation of making arbitrary spending decisions without knowing if their purchases are smart investments. However, <u> fifty-seven percent</u> of millennials compare prices thoroughly for in-store purchases, whereas older generations are much more likely to take prices at face value.Millennials also price check experiences, using peer review sites, social media and blogs to ensure that they&rsquo;re getting the best bang for their buck. If RIAs want to make inroads with this market, they need to offer a competitive advantage and make it well known. If not, millennials will move on to the next advisor in the queue, all at the touch of a button.<h3> Salary is the most important appeal of a job for Millennials.</h3>Though they are often referred to as the cash-strapped generation, salary is surprisingly not the most important appeal of a job for millennials. In fact, millennials have placed opportunities for career progression as the number one factor dictating employer attractiveness. Professional development and flexible working arrangements also rank high on the list, surpassing cash bonuses as the benefits millennials value most from an employer. To connect with this generation, RIAs need to better understand millennial values and working preferences and put programs in place to accommodate them.This post is a collaboration between Leah and another member of the <u> <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gregory FCA </a></u> team, Rachelle Gaynor.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-12 17:55:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-12 17:55:22.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_glyVuGt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/rias-its-time-to-understand-your-next-big-client/\", \"post_id\": \"4668\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-12 17:55:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-12 17:55:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"rias-its-time-to-understand-your-next-big-client\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4667\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2086\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436128003323-97dab5d267a9-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"592\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436796000,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

For example, most middle market sellers will greatly benefit from converting their C corporations to S corporations, but only if the conversion is done many years in advance of a potential transaction. Since many companies retain outside accountants only for tax preparation, many middle market owners have never worked with anyone on transaction planning and opportunities available for longer-term value creation. Like any other field, all accountants are not created equal. Consulting with an accountant that has significant M&amp;A experience well in advance of a transaction will likely yield significant increases in post-tax value.</p><h3> Personal Tax Planning: </h3><p> <br/> While evaluating the company&rsquo;s tax status, business owners considering a sale should simultaneously consult with an experienced deal accountant to evaluate their personal options for maximizing post-tax value.

From Avengers to Zombies, superheroes will be roaming the streets of our city this week, in search of heroic deeds and world domination.</p><p> To commemorate the popular annual event and help address the nation&rsquo;s staggering financial concerns &mdash; the continued lack of emergency savings and retirement planning, to name a few &mdash; we&rsquo;ve compiled our own superhero list for personal financial supremacy. From the Green Planner to the Fee Assassin, turning into one or all of these superheroes can help you build a successful financial life.</p><p> And while  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.comic-con.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Comic-Con  </a> </u> &rsquo;s characters are mostly limited to the four-day event, any of the superheroes below can and should make their appearance all year-round.</p><h3> The Green Planner. </h3><p> <br/> One of the best (and first) things one can do in building financial success is to identify goals and create a plan. While the specifics may change over the years, the overarching goal and the commitment to financial health should remain consistent. So, consider the end-game. Are you looking to accumulate wealth, put your child through college or plan for retirement? Or, like Bruce Wayne, better known as Batman, have you already built a successful empire, and are looking to wisely spend your funds in retirement? Once the goal is identified, create a plan to get there.</p><p> And don&rsquo;t forget, while many superheroes are indestructible, most of us are not. Having an estate plan, inclusive of insurance protection needs, helps protect assets as well as loved ones.</p><h3> The Super Saver. </h3><p> <br/> Savings are an essential component of any fiscal plan and the sooner you start saving, the more time you have to build a healthy life and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Automating a savings plan is one of the best ways to succeed in saving. Manually logging into your bank account to transfer funds into savings weekly or monthly creates added work and an opportunity to fail. I recommend working with a bank or financial planner to automate a savings plan. Opt for &lsquo;Turtle Power&rsquo; and start out slow, with a small amount. Increase the contribution as you get more comfortable with the process.</p><h3> Doctor Budget (Fee Assassin).</h3><p> <br/> A set budget offers a benchmark for incoming revenues and outgoing expenses, helping you gain control over finances. By continuously reviewing spending, one can easily identify opportunities to reduce fees or cut expenses altogether. Maybe you don&rsquo;t need the premium cable channels or the highest speed of Internet. Cutting those costs are a quick and easy way to find dollars to reinvest into a savings plan.</p><h3> The Amazing Investor. </h3><p> <br/> When it comes to investments, it&rsquo;s best to start early, keep investment costs and expenses low, and diversify. For instance, consider utilizing low-cost, broad-based index funds in your portfolio to diversify and reduce investment expenses, and mitigate tax consequences. Reducing costs is often an overlooked method of increasing long-term returns in a portfolio. As with savings, it&rsquo;s a good idea to automate an investment program, starting with a small amount.</p><h3> Captain Commitment. </h3><p> <br/> Regardless of which financial superpowers you excel in, there&rsquo;s nothing more important than drive, focus and commitment. Consider your overall plan. While having an investment strategy and retirement plan in place is great, you can maximize your financial health by reducing fees and taxes, saving more of your paycheck and optimizing your charitable contributions. Also, make sure to run an ongoing progress report. A weekly, monthly or even bi-annual financial checkup will help ensure you plan is on track, and you&rsquo;re making strides in the right direction.</p><p> <strong>  And don&rsquo;t forget, with great power, comes great responsibility. </strong> Wear your financial superhero mask or cape with pride and opt for financial domination.

{"original_id":2051,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Hugs Help and How Hugs Heal","link":"how-hugs-help-and-how-hugs-heal","source_link":null,"content":"<p> For  more years than I can remember, I have been a hugger. I&rsquo;m not sure how it happened because I can&rsquo;t recall my own father ever taking me into his arms and hugging me as a child. Somehow I just found out on my own how hugs can help comfort, encourage and energize both giver and receiver. I also discovered how hugs can heal and how the benefits of hugging someone far outweigh the risks.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll never forget my first visit to a feeding center located in the squatter&rsquo;s village of Mesquital on the south side of Guatemala City. These people had fled from the mountains to escape the rebel army and to seek a new life in the city. However, when they arrived there, they discovered that there were no jobs and no affordable housing.</p><p> Each family simply started to construct a home with whatever scrap materials could be salvaged from the local dump. Most homes are constructed of odd shapes of cardboard, tin and scrap lumber of every dimension. There is no space between each home. Each house is just build against another. The average size of these homes is approximately 200 square feet with no electricity or running water.</p><p> Imagine with me, the site: No paved streets &ndash; just a dirt path the width of a vehicle. No sidewalks &ndash; just open sewers running along the side of the road. No windows or doors &ndash; just old sheets hanging over the openings. No grass or landscaped areas for the kids to play on &ndash; just mud and dirt. No side streets &ndash; only an alley wide enough for a foot path and, you guessed it &ndash; an open sewer.</p><p> As our vehicle pulled into this &ldquo;Hell-hole&rdquo; and I witnessed the site I just described and as the sickening smell of people burning whatever they could find to burn as cooking fuel reached my nostrils, I began to cry. This experience caused my life to change forever. Thirty years later, as I share with you this experience, the tears come again.</p><p> My first thought as I stepped out that vehicle was &ldquo;O Lord, forgive me when I whine.&rdquo; I made a commitment right then and there, to myself and my Creator, that I would do my part in making the world a better place, that I would be bold enough to make a difference.</p><p> The next site literally tore my heart out. Kids came running from everywhere, yelling &ldquo;Gringos.&rdquo; The Americans who had started this feeding program which consisted of a Bible lesson and a warm meal twice a week, were affectionately referred to by these kids as &ldquo;Gringos.&rdquo; What took me by surprise was the fact that these kids were not afraid of me, a perfect stranger to them. As I knelt down and stretched out my arms and began hugging those dirty little kids, I made the startling realization that these kids were starving for more than food; they were starving for affection and love.</p><p> One little four-year old boy just wouldn&rsquo;t let go of me. He wrapped his arms around my neck and pressed his cheek against mine. I carried him that way as I followed the rest of the kids down a narrow path between two rows of shacks to the one used as the feeding center. I stooped to avoid hitting my head in the doorway as I entered a dimly lit room filled with rows of narrow benches. As the program began that afternoon with the kids singing at the top of their lungs, my little friend relaxed his grip around my neck and fell asleep on my lap. What a picture! As if to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finally found a friend who will love me and who cares&rdquo;.</p><h3> 5 Reasons to Make Hugging a Habit</h3><p> <br/> The five main reasons we all need to discover the magic of a hug are as follows:</p><li> Hugs are a natural stress reliever. The next time you see a stressed out person give them a hug.</li><li> Hugs help relax muscle tension and contribute positively to your physical health. Combine your hugs with a quick massage or shoulder rub for extra results.</li><li> Hugs can lower your blood pressure. When we hug the levels of oxytocinin our bodies are elevated and our blood pressure drops and our memory power increases. Sure beats drugs.</li><li> Hugging boosts your self-esteem and at same time makes the other person feel loved and special.</li><li> Hugs just make you feel good! Who needs a better reason than that to start hugging? <br/>  </li><p> Why not give it a try? Join the hugger club today. You will feel better and so will the people you hug!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-12 17:02:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-12 17:02:02.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_4z3ISpw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-hugs-help-and-how-hugs-heal/\", \"post_id\": \"4662\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-12 17:02:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-12 17:02:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-hugs-help-and-how-hugs-heal\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4661\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2083\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436190807865-2e156d40f1a2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1022\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436814900,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}

Then he used his eraser to break the circle, in effect creating openings for the bull to run out of.  He explained to us that the &lsquo;doors&rsquo; in the circle were objections and stalls the bull would use to escape the circle, and that our job was to answer each objection and close each door thereby blocking every exit of the bull.  Once the circle was complete, and the bull could no longer escape the closing circle, he would have no option other than to buy. </p><p> While I recognize that this isn&rsquo;t a very sophisticated analogy and that some people may even think it crude and not representative of today&rsquo;s interactive and consultative selling approach, I&rsquo;d like to point out its essential truth: Prospects often are going to give you more than one reason not to buy, and it&rsquo;s your job to be prepared to answer these objections, questions and concerns, close the circle, and repeatedly ask for the order. </p><p> The important part of the above paragraph is: &ldquo;repeatedly ask for the order.&rdquo;  Many sales reps may make one or two attempts to overcome an objection and then give up.  And once they do, the &ldquo;bull&rdquo; simply walks through one of the remaining open doors and gets away.  Only top closers have the fortitude and scripted responses to close ALL the doors and get the prospect to buy.  And that&rsquo;s where having a prepared book of effective scripts comes in. </p><p> Today&rsquo;s objection is a great example.  Prospects have many &ldquo;doors&rdquo; to escape through, and the objection, &ldquo;We tried this before and it didn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; is one of them.  Many sales reps struggle to overcome this objection, but if you&rsquo;re prepared for it, it&rsquo;s easy to close this door.  Here&rsquo;s how:</p><h3> Objection: &ldquo;We tried it before and it didn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Response: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I understand, but there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve got to keep in mind.  Today, technology changes so fast that a solution that came out just a few months ago is seldom comparable to its updated version even this week.  You probably see this with apps.  Heck, even Facebook comes out with improvements every two weeks, per Facebook. Do you use Facebook?&rdquo;</p><p> [If yes]: &ldquo;Then you know what I mean.</p><p> [If no]: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure you know what I mean, though.</p><p> &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the point: comparing our cutting edge solution to something that you tried 6 months ago &ndash; or worse, two years ago! &ndash; is like comparing a model T Ford to today&rsquo;s feature rich automobiles.  It simply isn&rsquo;t the same &ndash; and nor will your experience be the same. </p><p> Let me point out just two things that we do differently today than you may have been used to in the past&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> [And then point out two or three features you know are perfect for your prospect, then]:</p><p> &ldquo;So here&rsquo;s what I recommend you do.

{"original_id":2049,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Job Search: Online Networking","link":"the-job-search-online-networking","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Searching for a job can be very exciting and frustrating at the same time. There is no question that it is a complicated process that can be hard for a single person to go through and succeed in. Thus, it would be beneficial if you could seek a little help from your friends and other connections. This is where your networking skills will be put to test.</p><p> When it comes to networking, you may think that it&rsquo;s about reaching out to your professors, college roommates, or former bosses. While these people can still play a huge role in your search for a good job, you also need to explore other places where you can get the help that you need. A perfect place for this is the internet.</p><p> If you are straight to the point, polite, and sure about what you want, success can easily come to you. These are the same traits you need to have to take advantage of online networking.</p><h3> Below are some other tips that will help boost your online networking strategy:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  a. Always put your best foot forward. </strong></p><p> Never forget to start your invitation to connect with a professional and polite greeting. We all know that being formal and respectful are necessary, but many still ignore the importance of writing stuff like &ldquo;Dear Sir or Ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  b. Give the invitee an idea about how you know him or her. </strong></p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have a mutual connection or a common history with your invitee, it is important that you inform them how you actually know them. Mentioning a common link with the person you are inviting to be your contact will help assure the other person that you have good intentions for asking to be his or her contact.</p><p> <strong>  c. Make sure to compliment the person you are inviting to be a contact. </strong></p><p> This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to say all the positive things about the person, but you should at least offer them some kind words. If you are inviting a professional writer or author, for instance, it would help if you say that you like a particular novel or a simple article they&rsquo;ve written.</p><p> <strong>  d. State clearly what you want. </strong></p><p> This sentence doesn&rsquo;t have to be very long, but it is definitely the most difficult to compose. But then again, you should remember how hard it would be to get something you didn&rsquo;t ask for. Basically, you need to keep the phrase as simple as possible. However, you should make sure it clearly states what you want from the invitee. Never keep them guessing as this will likely result to them not responding to your request.</p><p> <strong>  e. Have a strong finish! </strong></p><p> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/individuals/career-coaching/career-coaching/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Career coaching experts  </a> </strong> always emphasize the importance of the last paragraph or sentences in a resume, cover letter, or in this case, an invitation to network. Don&rsquo;t forget to express your appreciation and say that you are looking forward to hearing from him or her soon.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-12 16:39:29.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-12 16:39:29.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_IyGZho9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-job-search-online-networking/\", \"post_id\": \"4658\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-12 16:39:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-12 16:39:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-job-search-online-networking\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4657\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2081\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-12-at-9.30.47-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"691\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436799600,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}

But to be a great connector, you don&rsquo;t have to. Successful connectors who would be classified as introverts often will enter into a social situation with a plan for those they want to meet and connect with. And, a plan almost always produces better results than going into a networking event or other meeting just &ldquo;winging it.&rdquo; To effectively connect with another person, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are introverted or extroverted; what matters is that you&rsquo;ve spent some time thinking about which relationships are most vital and have a plan for reaching them effectively.</p><h3> So, do introverts connect better than extroverts?</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes, yes. One of the nation&rsquo;s best known networking professionals actually came to the realization that he is an introvert! Ivan Misner, PhD, founder of BNI and the author of 11 books on networking, shared with me in an interview I conducted for The Connectors that he discovered he&rsquo;s actually an introvert. Misner said that his wife of 20 years told him during dinner one night that he displayed many introvert tendencies. Misner was shocked! How could the founder of the largest networking organization be an introvert? &ldquo;It struck me why I started BNI,&rdquo; Misner said. &ldquo;I was naturally uncomfortable meeting new people. BNI created a system that enabled me to meet people in an organized, structured, networking environment that did not require that I actually &hellip; talk to strangers.&rdquo;</p><p> Introverts, if they really want to make networking successful, will go into the event with a plan of action.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.redzonemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Networking-Planner-for-Introverts.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Click here to download the free tool, &ldquo;The Networking Planner for Introverts (and Extroverts)&rdquo;  </a> </u>  and become a better connector today!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-12 16:19:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-12 16:19:41.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_6QMd1OG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-are-introverts-better-connectors/\", \"post_id\": \"4656\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-12 16:19:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-12 16:19:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-are-introverts-better-connectors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4655\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2080\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-12-at-9.21.06-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"467\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436788800,"author_id":322,"chart_url":""}

When you are right there at the base and looking upwards one of the overwhelming impressions is just how big each of those individual blocks are that created this graceful building.</p><p> So it is with building a superb business, and that is especially so when the business is a purely professional service enterprise. There are no products to sell really, no tangible factors of consequence to deliver, and no thrilling memories or experiences that will be shared via photo&rsquo;s and video&rsquo;s on social media by customers with all of their friends and family.</p><p> Building a superb business that will withstand the tests of time, technology and innovation requires the same approach as building the Great Pyramids.  It is one massive block carved from nature which is then painstakingly put into place with significant labour that begins the pyramid.  Then another is added&hellip;.and another&hellip;.</p><p> <img alt=\"Slide1\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/slide1.jpg?w=550&amp;h=381\"/></p><p> There is always debate about whether a great business starts with great leadership, or whether great leadership simply must be present for the business to become great&hellip;and it is a moot point here.  If one is ton build a great professional services business there are essentially 9 big components.</p><h3> 1.  Consistent standards and expectations.  </h3><p> <br/> The standards of advice, competency, service standards must be consistent and continuous.  So too must the values and expectations of those involved.  This area is the foundation stone of the pyramid.</p><h3> 2.  A clear focus on having satisfied customers with consistent service experiences.  </h3><p> <br/> However, it is not enough to simply create great standards, there must be an expectation that they will continue to evolve further.  Consumer expectations are not static.</p><h3> 3. An early commitment to being business like.  </h3><p> <br/> Monitor, measure, report&hellip;.information and data and measuring the things that matter are the keys to analysing performance and highlighting opportunities.  They are the cornerstone of efficiency and good decision making.</p><h3> 4.  Understanding that the business is bigger than its owner, or even its shareholders.  </h3><p> <br/> Knowing who the stakeholders are and continually being mindful of all parties interests and concerns.  One of the deadliest things to any business is the runaway ego owner who thinks their agenda is primary. It isn&rsquo;t.  Enough said.</p><h3> 5.  Creating processes wherever possible within the practice.</h3><p> <br/> Processes reduce inefficiency, reduce errors, and produce consistent client experiences. They remove risk from the business, and maximise returns to owners.  Processes are gold.</p><h3> 6.  Customer Value is clear.  </h3><p> <br/> It may seem strange having this placed where it is, however most professional services firms begin by being many things to many people and then obtain clarity about their customer value.  When a practice is in tune with its customers and obtaining excellent feedback and understanding expectations it is then better placed to focus on pursuing what customers really value, instead of what we thought they valued.</p><h3> 7.  Goals clearly defined.  </h3><p> <br/> The goals for the business must be clear&hellip;not just the business owner&rsquo;s goals.  Those goals must be successfully shared with, and be relevant to, the key people inside the business.  This is where teams gel&hellip;</p><h3> 8.  Vision.  </h3><p> <br/> This is often underestimated in terms of its importance.  No race is fun though if there is no finish line.  What is the end game?  The fuel that will keep the practice moving forward is an understanding of what is trying to be built and why.</p><h3> 9.  Committed Leadership.  </h3><p> <br/> A champion for their people&hellip;a visionary&hellip;a leader demonstrating and instilling the values&hellip;someone who can maintain the focus on what matters, and make the decisions that matter.  Without this there may still be a business, but not one which fulfil its potential.</p><p> Without any of these elements you can still have a business which makes some money of course.  It just won&rsquo;t be one which is valuable enough to be attractive to customers and competitors alike because it will withstand the winds of change, and impose itself on its surroundings.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-12 16:09:32.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-12 16:09:32.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_yV8Pjwh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-9-building-blocks-of-a-business-which-will-stand-the-test-of-time/\", \"post_id\": \"4654\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-12 16:09:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-12 16:09:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-9-building-blocks-of-a-business-which-will-stand-the-test-of-time\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4653\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2079\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-12-at-9.11.13-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1086\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436803200,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

Sometimes, I hear from leaders that they aren&rsquo;t sure how to guarantee the exercise provides long-term, bottom-line value. Or I hear from participants, this is great, but I am not clear on what to do with this information. As a former Corporate Leader and a consultant who facilitates these types of exercises and discussions, we have found most people go through the following phases of development:</p><h3> Know</h3><p> <br/> Most people and consultants are aware of the common phrase &ldquo;the first step is awareness.&rdquo; But a good number of people think that means just learning the &ldquo;lingo&rdquo; of the particular assessment or methodology and what their &ldquo;type&rdquo; is. We encourage the leader, team and participants to honestly evaluate the current effectiveness, strengths and challenges of the team, including, their strategy, goals, and organizational structure (roles, process, and technology) that supports the execution of tasks to accomplish those goals. A more comprehensive review of how the team is working within the context of organizational factors, combined with, an analysis of the different behavioral styles, their natural strengths and struggles, the fit for the role and the fit within the organizational structure, values and behaviors (some people call this &lsquo;culture&rsquo;) will lead to a greater depth of understanding.</p><h3> Engage</h3><p> <br/> But never stop at Knowing. Many people do and that is why they don&rsquo;t see a lasting value with these exercises. The entire team, with the leader leading by example, needs to actively participate in the dialogue of what to do with this knowledge. And it can&rsquo;t be just one team session talking &ldquo;about&rdquo; it. The team discussion needs to focus on how to apply this knowledge to their people, process, and technology. Each team member has to internalize ownership by explaining specific actions they are going to take to change how the team is working together.

True, if there are 6 places to watch the video and not 1 then yes, the individual view count will be lower but remember, just like fans on Facebook and follower counts on Twitter, no one cares how many you have. If the content is good, the number of views it has is irrelevant to your potential customer.</p><p> It all comes down to you are trying to target and your videos content, but at Neil Weightman Digital Media Solutions we tend to use these 3:</p><h3> YouTube</h3><p> <br/> Unless you&rsquo;ve been under a rock for the past 10 years,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   YouTube  </a> </u>  remains the world&rsquo;s number 1 video site and for good reason.  It&rsquo;s easy to use, your customers will trust it, you can embed your videos on your website and being the 2nd largest search engine in the world (yes really!) there is a good chance your video will reach an audience organically.</p><p> If you wish to use commercially available music then YouTube is a good option too as most record companies have agreements in place for music on videos, although you will end up with adverts before or over the top of your video.</p><p> The downside to YouTube is the embeddable player isn&rsquo;t particularly customisable, your customers will see adverts for other companies and it&rsquo;s very easy to lose your audience&rsquo;s attention as they find video after video to watch, potentially from a competitor (we&rsquo;ve all gone to YouTube to watch 1 video and found ourselves still there 3 hours later 20 videos in).</p><h3> Vimeo Pro</h3><p> <br/> Founded by filmmakers,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vimeo  </a> </u>  was built with professional video in mind. If you are taking video seriously we suggest you give it a go.  The pro option allows you to fully customise your embeddable player on your website, videos display in HD and look beautiful.</p><p> It&rsquo;s less likely someone will stumble on your video by chance using Vimeo, but for use on your own website Vimeo is a much nicer option. You can also hide the stats on Vimeo videos, useful if they are of a commercial nature. There is a free version of Vimeo which has limits in place, but if you&rsquo;ve invested money in your video recording equipment, you may want to invest in your video hosting and if you do, Vimeo Pro gets our recommendation.</p><h3> Facebook Video</h3><p> <br/> As a video maker,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook  </a> </u>  video isn&rsquo;t a particularly pleasant experience. The upload process is clunky, the videos default in SD and not HD and you can&rsquo;t customise simple things like what picture you use on the video before you hit play. So why has it made it as one of our top choices? Because as far as reaching your Facebook audience goes, we wouldn&rsquo;t use any other method.  Facebook video take priority over all other video networks in their complicated news feed algorithm. Put the same video as a YouTube video on vs a Facebook video and the Facebook video wins every time.</p><p> While  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.neilweightman.com/changes-to-facebook-what-you-need-to-know/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook recently allowed you to start embedding videos on your own site  </a> </u> , we wouldn&rsquo;t use it for any other use other than directly on your Facebook page for the time being.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-10 16:19:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-10 16:19:00.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_TbtE18z.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/which-platform-should-you-upload-video-to/\", \"post_id\": \"4645\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-10 16:19:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-10 16:19:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"which-platform-should-you-upload-video-to\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4644\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2075\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436246745626-344c04303c72-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"608\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436806800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

New Divorce Funding Firms Can Be A Lifeline","link":"women-need-help-paying-for-your-divorce-new-divorce-funding-firms-can-be-a-lifeline","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Women are often shocked to realize how much it can cost to get divorced.</h3><p> <br/> Suffering through the decline of your marriage and finally deciding to call it quits is enough of an emotional wringer. Once you start interviewing attorneys and figuring out how much you need to fund your divorce, the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel can seem further away than ever.</p><p> Yes, today&rsquo;s financially complex divorces can be staggeringly expensive. Attorneys can cost hundreds of dollars per hour and require substantial up-front retainers. Plus, you&rsquo;ll need to pay your divorce financial advisor, and any forensic accountants, vocational and valuation experts, or other professionals whose expertise you may require in pursuit of a fair settlement. And on top of all that, you&rsquo;ll still need to manage your household expenses.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a daunting challenge even in a relatively amicable divorce. Imagine how difficult it can be if your husband is spiteful, controlling, abusive, and/or a narcissist! It&rsquo;s a well-known tactic of some well-to-do husbands to stall, delay, and needlessly complicate their divorces at every available opportunity so that the proceedings drag on for months or years. They prolong things just to drive up legal costs until their wives run out of money to continue, forcing them to take whatever deal is being offered. Without a well-funded war chest of their own, these women have no hope of a fair settlement.</p><h3> What can you do if you&rsquo;re facing divorce, and you don&rsquo;t have money of your own set aside?</h3><p> <br/> Or if you have a &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2013/02/14/pros-and-cons-of-keeping-a-secret-fund-in-case-you-divorce/\" target=\"_blank\">   secret fund  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; but it isn&rsquo;t nearly enough? And what can you do if your husband threatens to keep you in court until you&rsquo;ve spent your last dime?</p><p> You&rsquo;d be far from alone in any of those situations. Even asset-rich women can be caught short on cash when it comes time to hire a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?p=275\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   professional divorce team  </a> </u> . Usually, it&rsquo;s still the husband who&rsquo;s the &ldquo;monied&rdquo; spouse, and the wife who is financially dependent, sometimes even completely without income of her own.</p><p> But as challenging as financing divorce can be, it&rsquo;s not impossible, by any stretch. In fact, you may be able to get help from an emerging business niche that is devoted solely to this topic. Several companies now provide outside funding for divorcing women who lack the immediate means to fund their legal battles. Interestingly enough, divorce represents an investment opportunity for these companies. The idea is that if you have a top-notch divorce team, you&rsquo;re more likely to achieve a favorable settlement; then, the financiers will see a good return on the money they put into the effort.</p><p> For the finance companies, it&rsquo;s a money-maker; for women facing divorce battles with husbands who would otherwise wield most of the leverage and power in the proceedings, it can be a game-changer.</p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/steven-cohens-ex-wife-gets-outside-financing-for-lawsuit/?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">   recent article  </a> </u>  in The New York Times gives us a glimpse of how it works. Billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen is being sued by his ex-wife Patricia, who claims he cheated her in their 1990 divorce by hiding assets which should rightfully have been divided with her then. Court documents reportedly show that to fund the lawsuit against him, Ms. Cohen has obtained litigation financing from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.balancepointfunding.com/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Balance Point Divorce Funding  </a> </u> , which is in turn backed by  <a href=\"http://www.astafunding.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Asta Funding, Inc  </u>  . </a>  Although the specifics of the arrangement with Ms. Cohen are not reported, the Times article indicates that Balance Point does business by taking a percentage of the settlement in return for funding litigation.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.novitasus.com/novitas-us.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Novitas US  </a> </u>  (formerly National Divorce Capital, Inc.) also provides non-recourse advances to cover certain expenses associated with divorce proceedings. The advances can be used to pay legal fees and costs, including expert fees and personal expenses. No repayment is required unless and until a settlement is reached. Rather than being paid a specific fraction of the settlement, advances from Novitas are repaid according to an agreed schedule after a settlement or judgment is obtained.</p><p> &ldquo;We provide innovative and cost effective solutions so that financial inequality does not result in inequity,&rdquo; explained  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.novitasus.com/novitas-us/about/Nicole-Noonan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nicole Noonan  </a> </u> , Esq., CEO of Novitas US.</p><p> Whatever the repayment mechanism, one thing is certain: Outside funding can help level the playing field for many divorcing women. If Ms. Cohen didn&rsquo;t have the financial ability to continue litigation, Mr. Cohen would have no real motivation to settle with her. Knowing that she can fund the suit, he can&rsquo;t ignore it.</p><p> One note of caution: As of the date of this newsletter, funding options like these are available only in some states. Once the mechanisms become more well-known, I expect the divorce finance business will expand and become available (and less costly, with competition) to more women who need it.</p><p> _______________</p><p> <strong>  Reminder: </strong>  While divorce financing may be a godsend, never forget that it will need to be repaid in some way. Before you enter an agreement, make sure you understand the terms of repayment and that you&rsquo;re comfortable that you can meet the obligation.</p><p> <strong>  Legal matters: </strong>  Obtaining outside funding for your legal battle with your soon-to-be-ex husband could save you the time, difficulty and expense of protracted court proceedings. If he knows you have the resources to fight, there is less incentive for him to drag things on out of spite alone.</p><p> <strong>  Hot tip: </strong>  I&rsquo;m not surprised the law firms I know support divorce funding companies enthusiastically. After all, from the attorney&rsquo;s point of view, there&rsquo;s no better way to do business than with payment assured! If you are looking for divorce financing options, ask your attorney for recommendations. They may have several contacts for you to investigate.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-10 15:49:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-10 15:49:42.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_aoC53b1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/women-need-help-paying-for-your-divorce-new-divorce-funding-firms-can-be-a-lifeline/\", \"post_id\": \"4642\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-10 15:49:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-10 15:49:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"women-need-help-paying-for-your-divorce-new-divorce-funding-firms-can-be-a-lifeline\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4643\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2074\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436306896198-6f280fe8481b-copy_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1625\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436790600,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}

I think until we start interplanetary commerce this is the likelihood. Secondly, can we just for a moment push aside all that data, all those stats, all that research and just start from scratch?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take marketing from a humanistic angle. I hear you sigh. Sounds a bit flaky? Let&rsquo;s just clear up what to be &lsquo;humanistic&rsquo; means&hellip;</p><p> Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over established doctrine or faith &ndash;  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism\" target=\"_blank\">  Wikipedia </a></p><p> Often the word &lsquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology\" target=\"_blank\">   humanistic  </a> </u> &rsquo; is applied to psychotherapy. It deals with the here and now. What&rsquo;s in front of us. What we are dealing with right now. Our emotions and our needs, right now. It adopts a holistic approach to human existence and pays special attention to such phenomena as creativity, free will, and human potential. In other words, we are really focusing on the individual and his/her needs without assumptions or judgment or preconceptions.</p><p> Humanistic Marketing is a relatively new approach to marketing (so new it&rsquo;s yet to be listed on Wikipedia) Richard J Varey and Michael Pirson have written several books on Humanism in Business.</p><p> Humanistic Marketing is a response to the currently growing mega-trend call for rethinking marketing. The book organizes current thinking around the problems of marketing theory and practice as well as some possible solutions and ways forward: both for theory and practice. This volume was initiated by The Humanistic Management Network to contribute knowledge and understanding to the emerging humanistic business and management movement that does not accept perpetual economic expansion as a sustainably viable means of meeting individual and collective needs in society and nature, and instead seeks balance in place of excess. Humanistic Marketing recognises the harm that comes with the unfettered desire for more of more. The authors ask how can marketing&rsquo;s principles and practice be founded in humanistic values such as altruism, empathy, respect, trustworthiness, honesty, integrity, care, compassion, service, intelligence, beauty, justice, virtue? Furthermore, how can marketing help to protect human dignity and promote sustainable human (not consumer) well-being  &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://humanisticmanagement.org/cgi-bin/adframe/knowledge_center/books/article.html?ADFRAME_MCMS_ID=178\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Humanistic Marketing by Richard J Varey and Michael Pirson  </a> </u></p><p> Whilst this might sound a bit idealistic, this actually is the way marketing and business is shifting. A good example is the campaign by  <u>  <a href=\"http://youtu.be/XjJQBjWYDTs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Always &ndash; &lsquo;Like A Girl&rsquo;  </a> </u> . This focuses very strongly on the issues of feminism and gender equality with young people. The actual brand behind the campaign is almost unseen, leaning towards an altruistic, empathic and compassionate approach.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XjJQBjWYDTs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-09-at-11.40.52-AM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></p><p> click to watch</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s switch tack for a moment.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m going to bring in what could initially seem an anomaly in this: Parallel Thinking.

The blue hat dictates which order the hats are used.</p><p> <strong>  This would be a good order: </strong></p><p> White: Considering purely what information is available. What are the facts?</p><p> Red: Intuitive or instinctive gut reactions or statements of emotional feeling void of justification or judgment</p><p> Black: Logic applied to identifying reasons to be cautious and conservative</p><p> Yellow: Logic applied to identifying benefits, seeking harmony</p><p> Green: Statements of provocation and investigation, seeing where a thought goes</p><p> This order can be repeated as often as you want, but chances you&rsquo;ll have a pretty decent idea of where you going after one cycle.</p><p> This is a very humanistic approach, because it is in the &lsquo;here and now.&rsquo; We are saying what we think and feel at that moment without judgment. We are letting go of our fears that maybe our idea might be rejected or it isn&rsquo;t our place to talk about that area, that&rsquo;s a different department. Let&rsquo;s blur the lines a bit. Let&rsquo;s mix it up.</p><p> <strong>  At the foundation of humanistic counselling are the Core Conditions </strong></p><li> Empathy (Understanding of anothers needs)</li><li> Congruence (Honesty)</li><li> Unconditional Positive Regard (Void of judgment) <br/>  </li><h3> We can apply these to business as well as in life.</h3><p> <br/> So, lets throw it all up the air. Let&rsquo;s rethink the way we market and do business with each other. Let&rsquo;s lose the labels. Let&rsquo;s stride forward like the pioneers of technology and science and change the way we think. The world is moving fast, the millennials are waiting in the wings to take the reins. We need to adapt and change.

{"original_id":2040,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Baby on the Way? 5 Tips to be Better Prepared","link":"baby-on-the-way-5-tips-to-be-better-prepared","source_link":null,"content":"Do you remember how you felt upon finding out you were having a baby?Our journey began 5 years ago.We were filled with the excitement of all new parents.My wife even recorded my reaction when she told me she was pregnant.  We were both thrilled to see what was to come.We began nesting soon after, otherwise known as purging all the items that had been thrown in to the &ldquo;home office.&rdquo;She would also send me cute little emails about the baby&rsquo;s growth compared to the size of a fruit along with long lists of name ideas.A few weeks later, now with a clean (and bare) nursery ready to be decorated, we began discussing cribs, paint colors and gliders.At this point, we realized our new addition was going to be an expensive adventure.Even though we begin the journey as new parents with incredible excitement and anticipation, our list of questions for how best to prepare grows quickly.  Particularly how to best structure our financial lives for our new bundles of joy.I recently participated in an online conversation dealing with the question &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"http://www.experian.com/blogs/news/about/expecting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  What to Expect (Financially) When You&rsquo;re Expecting? </a></u>&rdquo; during the weekly Experian #CreditChat twitter conversation.Now that I&rsquo;ve been through it twice (I have 2 daughters &ndash; 4 years old and 14 months), I&rsquo;ve learned a few lessons that I discussed in my conversation which <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUKumwIlpwI&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  you can watch here </a></u>.I summarized some of the tips we discussed below:<h3> Child Care vs. Staying at Home</h3>Regardless of which way you go, you&rsquo;ll be faced with changes in the way you spend.  If both parents are working, childcare becomes a major expense with the national average now around $12,000 a year per child (with many much higher than this amount).On the other hand, if staying at home is most important for one spouse, sacrificing that income could drastically change the day to day family finances.There are always exceptions especially when one spouse has more control over their income. This is where walking through a financial plan helps you think through realistic numbers to create the life you desire.  But remember, this is often an emotionally charged decision, so the monetary sacrifice may hold little weight compared to what you feel is best for you child&rsquo;s development.<h3> Things to Do Before Baby Arrives</h3>While the cribs, strollers and car seat choices are important, there are bigger things to consider.This includes your life insurance amounts and estate planning items.It&rsquo;s not a bad idea to apply for life insurance once you decide to have a baby. Premium rates are more attractive the younger you are, so begin getting a few quotes.  Rules of thumb quote 8-10 times your annual income but working with a fee-only financial planner will give you the best judge of the amount you need.It&rsquo;s equally important to begin discussing a guardian and beneficiaries for your accounts.Look to update your will prior to the birth. It&rsquo;s most important to start discussing now, as these conversations can take years to get on the same page. Even <u> <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/financial-planners-estate-planning-journey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financial planners can have trouble </a></u> making decisions about estate planning topics.Don&rsquo;t forget to take a look at your health insurance policy as well. If you have a high deductible policy then make sure you max out your <u> <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/use-health-savings-account/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HSA contribution </a></u> as it will be a nice tax benefit.Knowing what potential out of pocket costs to expect, can prevent a potential nervous breakdown when multiple bills begin showing up in the first few weeks after your hospital visit.From a tax perspective, investigate your ability to save in pre-tax savings opportunities through your employer.Flexible Spending Accounts and a Dependent Care FSA can help <u> <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/fsa-contribution-limit-2015.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  avoid taxation on up to $10,600 (in 2015) </a></u> for joint tax filers if elected during open enrollment periods.  But if you have two children, and both work, taking the <u> <a href=\"https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Family/The-Ins-and-Outs-of-the-Child-and-Dependent-Care-Tax-Credit/INF27554.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  child and dependent care credit </a></u> could be better than the Dependent Care FSA. Another question to run by your tax advisor.<h3> Spend Time Together</h3>One of the more important but least conventional tips is to be intentional about spending time together.New parents are generally so wrapped up in the excitement and anticipation of the little one, they forget to treasure the time they have together.  So we encourage expectant couples to plan some spending for themselves in the nine months prior to your new family member arriving.This is when incredible conversations can happen about how you want to raise your baby.  Taking a trip together to enjoy spending time with each other can be an incredible memory, especially once the baby is with you 24/7.I speak from experience.  But it&rsquo;s important to plan for this ahead of time as you are formulating your new spending plan post baby.<h3> After the Baby Arrives</h3>Many of our first instincts when having a baby is to begin saving for college.But most people don&rsquo;t realize there are <u> <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/who-should-pay-for-college/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  multiple avenues to accomplish this goal </a></u>.The right strategy for you depends on your tax bracket and spending desires.  Many people want to save in 529 accounts immediately regardless of other saving strategies they may be avoiding.When we first meet with clients, we often see <u> <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/529-traps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  balances in a 529 account </a></u> but little to no savings in Roth IRA accounts. Because you have the option to withdraw your contributions tax-free and penalty free from a Roth IRA, saving in these accounts first could be the better bet.This is where personal attention and analysis helps to avoid missed opportunities that occur without guidance.Priorities can change very quickly for new parents.After the baby arrives, stuff (and house guests) tends to accumulate quickly in your house. So moving to a bigger house moves up the priority list quickly. This demands more liquidity potentially and quicker access to cash.Other parents decide to work less to spend more time with their kids.Some want to move from city locales to be closer to their own parents to have help. These choices all have varying financial impacts. But your decision-making is not always the most rational when your sleep-deprived. So building flexibility in to a financial plan can help you set up your life the way you really desire it to be with Junior now in the family.There are many other tips to consider during the first year which we explore during our <u> <a href=\"http://www.experian.com/blogs/news/about/expecting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  YouTube conversation </a></u>.<h3> Enjoy the Ride</h3>Along with checking off all the responsible new parent items, one of the more special things my wife and I did was record our feelings of what life would be like when the baby arrived.Everything, from how excited, scared, or clueless we were to how we thought life would be after she was here. It&rsquo;s one of the more special memories we have together that can&rsquo;t be measured with money.As the clich&eacute; goes, the time has flown by. My oldest daughter turned 4 this month.In other words, she&rsquo;s now an energy-filled, professional pretender, question asking machine.  Just this week, she performed a puppet show, played her &ldquo;guitar&rdquo; brush, and asked about the emotions of a triceratops within 10 minutes.  In the moment, it can be an overload of action.But upon reflection, makes me envy her capacity for enthusiasm, creativity and curiosity all at once. Maybe you&rsquo;ve experienced something similar with your children.With that, I would encourage you to be sure and enjoy the journey.   Having a baby changes your life in so many ways that can&rsquo;t be quantified. But for the ways that can, do your best to plan for it!","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-09 18:42:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-09 18:42:07.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_UldFL7X.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/baby-on-the-way-5-tips-to-be-better-prepared/\", \"post_id\": \"4635\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-09 18:42:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-09 18:42:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"baby-on-the-way-5-tips-to-be-better-prepared\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4634\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2071\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/edit_9751-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"493\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436547600,"author_id":100,"chart_url":""}

Even those who had ideal  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estate plans  </a> </u>  in place leave behind family members faced with not only a great personal loss, but also some legal headaches.</p><p> One of the primary concerns facing  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   beneficiaries  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estate executors  </a> </u>  in these situations is whether to file suit against the person responsible for the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decedent.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   decedent&rsquo;s  </a> </u>  passing. In some circumstances, an executor who elects NOT to pursue a claim may even be deemed to have acted irresponsibly.</p><p> Two distinct claims can be brought in New Jersey &mdash;</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/wrongful-death-lawsuits-new-jersey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wrongful death action  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/survival-action/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Survivor action  </a> </u> <br/>  </li><p> The wrongful death action is brought on behalf of the family and beneficiaries of the decedent and is meant to compensate them primarily for the economic losses they suffered as a result of the death. Suits of this type often involve what might seem like cold calculations because they seek to value the decedent in terms of the economic force he or she contributed to the well-being of the family members. For example, if a man&rsquo;s wife dies in an accident, his wrongful death claim might be calculated based on her employment income at the time of her death as well as more complex calculations such as the value of her now lost guidance and support.</p><p> The important concept here for estate purposes is that wrongful death awards flow directly to the family member &mdash; they do not pass through the estate and thus are not subject to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probate.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   probate  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estatetax.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estate taxes  </a> </u> .</p><p> Survivor actions, on the other hand, are brought on behalf of the decedent himself or herself and can be filed by a non-beneficiary representative of her or his estate. These actions seek compensation for the harm suffered by the decedent between the time of the death-causing-injury and her or his actual death. Funeral expenses are also often sought in survivor actions. Unlike wrongful death awards, the awards from a survivor action are payable to the estate and thus subject to probate and any applicable taxes.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-09 18:34:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-09 18:34:56.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_ujTXQKp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/blood-money-the-impact-of-wrongful-death-survivor-actions-on-a-victims-estate/\", \"post_id\": \"4633\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-09 18:34:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-09 18:34:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"blood-money-the-impact-of-wrongful-death-survivor-actions-on-a-victims-estate\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4632\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2070\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/candlelight-vigil.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"514\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436551200,"author_id":11,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2038,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Responsive Brands Win Customer Loyalty","link":"how-responsive-brands-win-customer-loyalty","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Not that long ago, we heard the story behind Federal Express&rsquo;s much-talked-about 1994 rebranding. Many of you may have heard this one before, but it was new to us.</p><p> Through a series of focus groups, the design firm behind Federal Express&rsquo;s rebranding became aware that everyone called the company FedEx, even using the term as a verb. Few people ever had the need to utter the words &ldquo;Federal Express.&rdquo;</p><p> This was obvious to the customers using Federal Express&rsquo;s services, but it was something the company hadn&rsquo;t thought much about.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a lot more to this story, and you can read all about it in this  <u>  Fast Company article </u> . But what we learned was that, as a result of customer feedback, Federal Express became FedEx and launched a brand new look around this new name. A look that is often cited as one of the most successful and creative ever designed.</p><h3> What works</h3><p> <br/> The FedEx story is an extreme example of how brands can benefit from responding to customer feedback.</p><p> Most of us are more concerned with responding to negative reviews on social media or online review sites. Regardless of the platform, brands that respond to feedback are being rewarded with improved customer sentiment and increased business.</p><p> It isn&rsquo;t always easy to decide how to respond. We find it helps to think about how you would deal with a customer who took the time to give you feedback in person.</p><p> With positive feedback, your response would likely be simple. You would say thanks and let the customer know you appreciate their feedback. Negative feedback is clearly less fun to deal with, but it still calls for a quick and thoughtful response.</p><p> Survey data from Bazaarvoice shows what happens when a brand responds to feedback in a thoughtful way. It makes customers feel that your brand cares about consumers (41%), has great customer service (35%), is trustworthy (22%) and sells high-quality products (14%). (Source:  <u>  Infographic </u> : How consumers reward responsive brands.)</p><p> What&rsquo;s considered a thoughtful response? Brands that fared best offered to refund, upgrade or exchange a product. Customers who saw that response were 90% more likely to purchase from that brand.</p><p> Brands that responded by suggesting an additional step, like calling customer service, were only slightly less well received, with 89% of people being more likely to purchase from that brand.</p><h3> And what doesn&rsquo;t work</h3><p> <br/> Again, let&rsquo;s think about a costumer who offers negative feedback in person. You might not agree with their feedback, and you might use it to start a conversation. But you wouldn&rsquo;t ignore them or, worse, belittle them in any way.</p><p> Doing so on social media is no more acceptable, and could set you up for an online backlash.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t delete negative feedback from your website or social media channels in an effort to make your brand look good. First of all, it&rsquo;s just not the right thing to do. Second of all, it&rsquo;s far too easy for a customer to take screenshots of a deleted conversation and share them widely.</p><p> Obvious trolling is a separate issue. It can be smart to ignore or even delete troll-like comments to provide the best experience for your real customers.</p><p> But even with trolls, don&rsquo;t take a defensive approach by insulting these commenters or calling them out. It&rsquo;s not worth the time, and it will only leave your real customers with a negative impression of your brand.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-09 18:26:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-09 18:26:21.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_DM52WhN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-responsive-brands-win-customer-loyalty/\", \"post_id\": \"4631\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-09 18:26:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-09 18:26:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-responsive-brands-win-customer-loyalty\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4630\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2069\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fed_Ex_0007-plane1.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"880\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436553900,"author_id":126,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s kind of like learning to ride a bike for the first time. We are so excited to master the skill and ride our bike through the streets. Yet, to get to that point of success, we need to learn how to steer, brake and fall a lot. Those of us who can endure the scrapes and bruises, will be well prepared and able to handle the bigger skirmishes. So are you ready to get up on that seat, put on that helmet and learn the rules of the leadership ride?</p><p> <strong>  Here are five ways to begin a new leadership role: </strong></p><h3> 1. Be Clear on the New Position <br/>  </h3><p> Before beginning any new role, it is important to have a  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2012/10/09/are-you-a-leader-in-career-development/#sthash.3fdR7koM.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   crystal clear understanding  </a> </u>  of that role. That means:</p><li> Review the job description if it exists</li><li> Set up a meeting with your new boss to get their perspective on your responsibilities</li><li> Talk to your new team members because they will have the real scoop</li><li> If something feels uncomfortable about the new position, try to readjust the issue before it gets out of hand</li><li> Look in the mirror and say out loud: &ldquo;I am ready and I know I can handle this exciting new step.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=New+leaders+feel+empowered+when+they+have+clarity+on+their+role.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/07/06/five-key-skills-for-new-leaders/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   New leaders feel empowered when they have clarity on their role  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 2. Take Stock in Your Strenghts <br/>  </h3><p> Taking a look inside of us can be worth the effort in honestly identifying what we bring to this new role. Ask yourself:</p><p> What do people ask me to help them with?</p><p> What type of responsibilities do I most enjoy?</p><p> Where in my career so far have I really  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/04/30/what-are-your-leadership-gifts/#sthash.07rRXzUi.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   shined  </a> </u> ?</p><p> Which of my expertise and talents will really come in handy in this new position?</p><p> Where do I still want to grow?</p><p> The answers will provide a road map of how to tackle this new opportunity so that you can both share your gifts and grow your leadership.</p><h3> 3. Identify a Trusted Network</h3><p> <br/> We all know that it is impossible to &ldquo;go it&rdquo; alone and that means we each need to locate a group of colleagues to become our trusted advisors. Look around at work. Look around in your personal life. Look around in your volunteer world.  Who are the individuals we count on for support and valuable feedback?</p><p> Whose opinions do you value and know that they will have your back? Then ask them to be part of your special council.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Successful+new+leaders+cultivate+a+trusted+network+of+support.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/07/06/five-key-skills-for-new-leaders/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Successful new leaders cultivate a trusted network of support  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 4. Bone up on Your Communication Skills <br/>  </h3><p> This is one thing that may not seem so obvious to new leaders but can be a deal breaker early on. Being  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2013/11/28/what-we-can-learn-from-marching-band-leaders/#sthash.d4vdJOfT.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   open and direct  </a> </u>  while respectful of other&rsquo;s points of view empowers leaders to be heard and impactful. You may have strong technical skills, but leading involves being able to share your ideas in an effective way.</p><li> Focus on active listening without interrupting</li><li> Use non-judgmental and inclusive language (Substitute &ldquo;BUT&rdquo; with &ldquo;AND&rdquo;)</li><li> If someone says something you disagree with, say &ldquo;I disagree&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;You are wrong&rdquo;</li><li> Match your body language and facial expressions with the words coming out of your mouth</li><li> Honor cultural differences <br/>  </li><h3> 5. Reach Out for Input and History <br/>  </h3><p> Any time I started a new position, I would take time to learn what was currently happening and why. Having an historical perspective can be invaluable in mapping out the future. Also, team members want to feel that their past work is important to the future steps.

{"original_id":2035,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Secrets to Creating Value","link":"7-secrets-to-creating-value","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SuccessMatters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mark Thompson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.markcthompson.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   MarkCThompson.com  </u> </a></p><p> When you do something meaningful for yourself that also does good for others, you work twice as hard at it. But if your heart isn&rsquo;t in what you do everyday, you&rsquo;ll burn out much faster, become less creative, and make more mistakes. It&rsquo;s hard to create value if you don&rsquo;t care&mdash;and it&rsquo;s almost impossible for others to value you when you feel that way.</p><p> This new attitude is what our cheeky friend Branson&mdash;whose heart is as big as his genius for building brands&mdash;irreverently calls Screw Business as Usual. He and his Virgin Unite Foundation are driving a social movement of entrepreneurs and corporate managers who believe it&rsquo;s in their enlightened self-interest to create value in their career, and in doing so create more value in a business that does well (financially) and does good (for the world). The breakthrough idea here is that it&rsquo;s not one or the other. It&rsquo;s both.</p><p> When our national survey revealed that Americans feel a disconnect between what&rsquo;s meaningful in their life and their career ambitions, it made sense that most respondents said they are disengaged in their work. But there&rsquo;s a cure. You will be more courageous in following your dreams, and feel hugely engaged in your work and creating value, if you&rsquo;re doing work that matters to you.</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt overwhelmed on too many occasions to count,&rdquo; Branson sighed as he shared photos of his cherished home burning down. It was not the first time he had his dream blown away. More than 350 companies carry the Virgin Brand, but many have failed to survive. If it had been easy for Branson, he would not be nearly so inspiring as a leader. Even when they&rsquo;re bored, scared, disappointed, or exhausted, successful leaders cling to the knowledge that their time is limited and focus intensely on contributing value and remaining creative.</p><h3> How to Build Value</h3><p> The secret to creating value is to find some mission that speaks to you. When you do, you&rsquo;ll have more energy and courage to do something that other people value, respect, and eventually, admire. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be world hunger; but it does have to be personal to you and useful to other people who will hire you or buy the product.</p><p> The following are eight strategies for isolating what is meaningful to you and building more value into your work.</p><p> <strong>  Value Builder #1: Don&rsquo;t try to be all things to all people. </strong></p><p> Trying to serve too many MVPs only results in you adding less value to more people. Be clear about who you want to be valuable to. Help those people define their success and achieve it.</p><p> <strong>  Value Builder #2: Be simple, convenient, and usable. </strong></p><p> Focus on making the service or product as easy to use and intuitive as possible. Think about what you want your target audience to be, do, or have. How could you help them achieve that? Observe how your target audience uses what you have to sell and how they solve problems.</p><p> <strong>  Value Builder #3: Get known and showcase what is valuable. </strong></p><p> How are you getting the word out about what you do? How are you presenting yourself or your services in a way that makes it attractive to customers?</p><p> <strong>  Value Builder #4: Give a sense of security. </strong></p><p> Protect what your target audience believes is valuable.</p><p> <strong>  Value Builder #5: Define &ldquo;quality.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Your customer may define &ldquo;quality&rdquo; differently than you do. For some retail items, for example, quality may mean that something looks chic or expensive, not whether it&rsquo;s the most advanced technology.</p><p> <strong>  Value Builder #6: Be in the right place at the right time. </strong></p><p> To be available to your customer you&rsquo;ve got to be where they are. It&rsquo;s also good career advice: We have a dear friend who wanted to be a Hollywood writer and producer. It was much easier for him to pursue that dream once he moved to Southern California so that he could actually meet with and learn from the people involved in that industry.</p><p> <strong>  Value Builder #7: Dump the mission statement. </strong></p><p> Instead create a manifesto that is real to your customer and that you and your team actually believe and are willing to be held responsible to deliver. When I was reviewing entries as one of six global judges selected by Richard Branson for his Virgin Unite entrepreneurship competition, I was impressed by the meaningful manifesto created by an organization called, \"A Lot to Say.\" What made Sir Richard&rsquo;s event different was that all of the start-ups that entered, including \"A Lot to Say,\" were equally committed to a social mission as they were to creating a profitable business, a concept that&rsquo;s been catching momentum in recent years and becoming bankable.</p><h3> Here's the A Lot to Say Manifesto:</h3><p> <br/> If you think something, say it. <br/> If you believe something, say it. <br/> If you want something, say it. <br/> Because saying it creates new awareness. Awareness sparks new behavior. <br/> And new behavior inspires us all to be better. If we speak out, others will act out. <br/> To vote. Recycle. Save. <br/> To think a little more. <br/> To try a little harder.</p><p> To live more honestly. Thoughtfully. Joyfully. You have a lot to say. <br/> So never be afraid to say it. Or wear it.</p><p> Everyday.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-09 17:59:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-09 17:59:41.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Xu1PhTP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-secrets-to-creating-value/\", \"post_id\": \"4625\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-09 17:59:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-09 17:59:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-secrets-to-creating-value\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4624\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2066\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436285122087-89584a1d9398-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"459\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436528700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2033,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Reasons Your B2B Content Marketing is Failing","link":"8-reasons-your-b2b-content-marketing-is-failing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2015_B2B_Research.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Content Marketing Institute  </a> </u>  reports that &ldquo;70% of B2B marketers are creating more content than they did one year ago, even those who say they are least effective (58%) and those without any type of strategy (56%).&rdquo; In 2015, only 38% of B2B marketers rated themselves as &ldquo;effective&rdquo; at content marketing &mdash; which is down from 42% last year. Most marketers seem to think they are not completely ineffective &mdash; but rather, fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p> As an experienced digital marketing firm, we&rsquo;ve seen all manners of content &mdash; the good, the bad and the ugly. We&rsquo;ve worked with some amazing companies that just needed the right presentation of their brand to boost their bottom line and gain more customers. Good  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-b2b-content-marketing-trends-consider/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   B2B content  </a> </u>  is informative, unique, inspires action, and attracts an eager audience that is most ready to buy. Easier said than done, though, right?!</p><p> In today&rsquo;s post, we&rsquo;ll take a look at eight specific problems B2B marketers encounter with their business blogs&hellip;</p><h3> 1. You Don&rsquo;t Have a Strategy.</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2015_B2B_Research.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The latest statistics  </u>    </a> show that 60% of those with a documented strategy rate themselves &ldquo;highly effective&rdquo; in their content marketing, versus just 32% of those with only a verbal strategy in place. There is no generic template to use for writing down your strategy, as each company approaches the task with their own distinctive needs in mind. Yet, most businesses, regardless of industry, will find it helpful to include the following information in their plan:</p><p> &ndash; Mission Statement: What measurable goals do you hope to achieve with your content marketing?</p><p> &ndash; Platform: Decide where to publish, be it a blog, social media site(s), video sites, or discussion forums.</p><p> &ndash;  Target Market: Who are you writing for? What information do they need? What problems do they have?</p><p> &ndash; Reader Personas: Where does your &ldquo;bread-and-butter&rdquo; lie? What demographics BUY the most from you?</p><p> &ndash; Keyword Research: Which keyword phrases will link your target audience with your content?</p><p> &ndash; Editorial Calendar: What are some topics to write about? When/where will you publish? Who is in charge?</p><p> &ndash; Analytic Reports: How can progress toward your goals be measured and monitored?</p><p> Don&rsquo;t fret if you are having trouble obtaining any of this information.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/hire/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A good digital marketing consultant can help!  </a> </u></p><p> <img alt=\"challenges that B2B marketers face\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/B2B-Challenges-of-Marketers.png\"/>        <br/> Image Source:  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2015_B2B_Research.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Content Marketing Institute 2015 Benchmarks  </u>    </a></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%23Fact%3A+54%25+of+B2B+Marketers+Struggle+With+Producing+Engaging+%23Content&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-b2b-content-marketing-failing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #Fact: 54% of B2B Marketers Struggle With Producing Engaging #Content  </a> </u></p><h3> 2. You&rsquo;re Not Measuring Results.</h3><p> <br/> We get it&hellip; the vast amount of content monitoring tools out there is totally overwhelming! Even so, you&rsquo;ve got to pick one. At the very least, use social media dashboards to look at retweets and brand mentions. Also, learn to use free tools offered by Google, like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Analytics  </a> </u> , to assess website traffic, clicks and leads coming in from your keywords or social sites. You want to know what your best performing blog posts are, how many unique visits you&rsquo;re getting, how much of your overall traffic comes from social media, and which topics are converting readers into buyers. Focus your efforts on what&rsquo;s working and grow your subscriber base to grow your sales.</p><p> Hint: One of the programs we love for social monitoring is  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-social-media-management-tool-sprout-social/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sprout Social  </u>  . </a></p><h3> Not sure how to interpret your Google Analytics? </h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/web-analytics-consulting-services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hiring a web analytics consulting firm may be a good idea!  </a> </u></p><h3> 3. You Lack Consistency.</h3><p> <br/> As the graphic above illustrates, 50% of marketers cite &ldquo;producing content consistently&rdquo; as a major challenge. Often, a busy entrepreneur will make blogging a priority at first and dump lots of time and effort into the task; but soon, time and energy are lacking and the posts become less frequent. Sometimes they go several weeks or even months without an update. The same holds true for social media accounts. To fix the problem, you need to hire dedicated personnel who can put in the time, effort and resources necessary to keep the content engine humming. Even if your budget only allows room for one blog post a month, it&rsquo;s still important to have a person who makes the update his or her priority. Remember, every piece of content doesn&rsquo;t have to be a blog. It can be a social media post, a video, an infographic, or even just a question posed to your readers to get them thinking. How often to post is a question B2B marketers grapple with, depending on your industry, audience, needs and budget.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/content-marketing-services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mod Girl Marketing  </a> </u>  can help you develop an editorial calendar you&rsquo;re happy with &mdash; that provides results, too!</p><p> <img alt=\"content mix and frequency\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/content-mix-1024x576.jpg\"/> <br/> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://kontenthaus.com/b2b-marketing-content-frequency/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kontenthaus.com  </a> </u></p><h3> 4. Your Content Is Too Egocentric.</h3><p> <br/> A survey by  <u>  The Economist Group </u>  found that marketers are falling short of providing content with substance. We&rsquo;ve seen a lot of business blogs that enter post after post about a product they&rsquo;re developing, staff member achievements, awards they&rsquo;ve won, parties they&rsquo;re throwing, updates to their building, or a contest they&rsquo;re holding. While you feel the company news approach builds brand awareness and shows a strong, thriving, innovative company, not everyone outside your firm will see it that way. Readers want to know: &ldquo;How will this help me?&rdquo;</p><p> Sharing company news is important, of course&hellip; just don&rsquo;t make it the central basis of your content strategy. Think of company news as a seasoning, to be used sparingly.  <u>  <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/b2b-content-marketers-market-content-focus-value-113425\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   According to Marketingland,  </a> </u>  decision-making executives find that the most useful content:</p><p> &ndash; Delves into the industry outlook &amp; trends.</p><p> &ndash; Examines both sides of a complicated issue.</p><p> &ndash; Educates them on an area of business unfamiliar to them. <br/>  </p><p> In short: Aim for content that is unique and timely. Avoid the hard sell.</p><h3> 5. You Don&rsquo;t Know How To Include Calls To Action.</h3><p> <br/> Some bloggers are hesitant to include a call-to-action because they don&rsquo;t want to appear salesy or pushy. However, people expect to be directed to a place where they can learn more or act upon the new information you&rsquo;ve just given them. A call-to-action can be as simple as a mailing list signup, a link to another article, or a &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; sentence.</p><p> Other options include:</p><p> &ndash; Offer a coupon, discount or offer.</p><p> &ndash; Promote a free trial or demo.</p><p> &ndash; Provide a contact form at the end of your article.</p><p> &ndash; Send readers to a piece of thought leadership like an eBook, whitepaper or video.</p><p> &ndash; Transition your audience to a testimonial or case study to demonstrate your expertise.</p><p> Keep in mind, most readers are hungry for more content, rather than a sales pitch. Make your company contact information readily available on each page, but focus your efforts on lead cultivation through information.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=5+CTAs+to+include+in+your+%23ContentMarketing&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-b2b-content-marketing-failing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 CTAs to include in your #ContentMarketing  </a> </u></p><p> Fact: Did you know the average HubSpot blog contains at least nine CTAs?</p><p> <a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/b2b-trends.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"b2b trends content marketing\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/b2b-trends-1024x617.png\"/> </a></p><p> Image Source:  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2015_B2B_Research.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Content Marketing Institute 2015 Benchmarks  </u>    </a></p><h3> 6. You Focus On &ldquo;Just Doing It&rdquo; Instead of &ldquo;Doing It Right&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> There are people who can write&hellip; and then there are people who live to write. If your heart and head are not in every blog post and you find the task to be drudgery more often than not, then it&rsquo;s best to leave the job up to a professional. Readers are drawn to writing that oozes passion, expertise and information. That sort of substance can&rsquo;t happen when your mind is elsewhere and you&rsquo;re feeling overtaxed. Free up your own time to work on what you do best by delegating your content marketing to someone else. Use what precious little time you can muster to speak with your content producer regarding topics, keywords and the type of thought leadership you&rsquo;d like exemplified in your blog. Be sure that your content strategy is guided by sound research, so your approach is effective.</p><h3> 7. You&rsquo;re Doing What Everyone Else is Doing.</h3><p> <br/> Cherry-picking topics from a competitor blog might be tempting, but it&rsquo;s ill-advised. You may see a lot of comments or shares on a piece, but do you know how well the post is performing compared to other posts on the site? Perhaps the success is more an indication of the blogger or the company&rsquo;s success, rather than the success of the topic itself.</p><p> Most of your competitors have as much of a clue about content marketing as you do. Some businesses get hung up on content formats their competitors are using. Your competition may be running surveys, publishing loads of whitepapers and making original videos, but if you don&rsquo;t have the resources or the ability to accomplish these tasks well, then what good are these tactics?</p><p> You need to focus on what&rsquo;s working for you and what you do best. Think of it this way: the best marathon runners aren&rsquo;t competing against the pack; they&rsquo;re competing against themselves and their own best times. You should do the same by looking at analytics data particular to your industry and your company. If you&rsquo;re working with a consulting firm, you want to make sure they don&rsquo;t apply a one-size-fits-all formula to every brand they service.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/in-house-vs-agency-digital-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   See how Mod Girl Marketing&rsquo;s boutique digital marketing firm compares to the big marketing agencies.  </a> </u></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%23ContentMarketing+Tip%3A+Focus+on+What%27s+Working+for+YOU+and+What+YOU+Do+Best.+%238ways&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-b2b-content-marketing-failing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #ContentMarketing Tip: Focus on What&rsquo;s Working for YOU and What YOU Do Best. #8ways  </a> </u></p><h3> 8.

What differentiates run-of-the-mill content from true thought leadership are unique stories, particular to YOUR business, YOUR experience and YOUR outlook.</p><p> Sure, not every post can be a brilliant masterpiece of originality, but you want to make sure that you&rsquo;re at least taking the time to share intimate details of your day-to-day operations with your content producer.  <a href=\"http://copywritertoronto.com/2015-b2b-content-marketing-mistakes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  As   <u>   CopywriterToronto.com puts it  </u> </a> : &ldquo;Where can you illustrate some of your key points with stories?

Of course you don&rsquo;t.</p><p> Nowadays, half the world&rsquo;s employees work in a coffee bar. People lean over toward their neighbor and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you here all week.

Hire the right employee who you can trust and you&rsquo;ll never have time to ask yourself where she is at 5:00 PM because you&rsquo;ll be too busy wondering how she produces such fantastic !</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s Saturday (pick any time) and you&rsquo;re upset he didn&rsquo;t respond to the email you sent five minutes ago. </strong>  If why doesn&rsquo;t everyone work the weekend is on your top three pet peeves, I think you should work in a bar. No. Not a coffee bar. An actual bar.</p><p> <strong>  You never say thanks on any day of the week. </strong>  Feeling appreciated is one of the most important happiness factors to any employee. There are many ways to show it&mdash;pay raises, bonuses, new opportunities, additional training, gift cards, a plant on the desk, so on and so forth. I also find a simple, &ldquo;Thank you so much for your effort.

{"original_id":2031,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Reasons Why Consumers View Brands As Relationships","link":"4-reasons-why-consumers-view-brands-as-relationships","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Out of all the success metrics, if we measure brands the way we measure healthy relationships, we can easily trump the competition.Metrics are an integral part of a brand&rsquo;s strategy. They help businesses understand how their brand is performing within the framework of customer values and expectations. Unfortunately, however, brand performance metrics are limited to only share of voice and brand loyalty.What about brand relationships?Organizations should consider their brand as a relationship with consumers. Similar to human relationships, brands must take elements of traditional relationship building and apply it to its overarching brand strategy.For instance, think about the relationships in your life&hellip;</p><li> Do you look forward to seeing that person?</li><li> Do you care about them?</li><li> Do they share your values?</li><li> Do you speak well of them to others?</li>To truly understand your brand perception, you should ask yourself these questions. Does your brand presence compare to the relationships you have build over the year?If not, what can you do to mimic the positive dynamics of such relationships?If so, can you identify what actions it took to get you in your consumer&rsquo;s good graces?Brand Marketing Just Won&rsquo;t Cut It. It&rsquo;s All About Relationship Marketing Now. Given the abundance of competitive information and the content available online, today&rsquo;s consumers are more informed than ever. This has resulted in a drastic shift in consumer power and has altered the selling process by placing a greater emphasis on the customer experience.Here&rsquo;s 4 reasons why consumers view brands as relationships&hellip;<h3> 1. They Have Moved Beyond A Traditional Purchase Process to Organic Discovery</h3>Today&rsquo;s consumers&rsquo; come to a brand through many online sources such as social media, search engines, reviews, peer recommendations and more.Marketers are no longer leading us to brand, its the relationships we have with one another that leading us to brands.Recently, content marketing has played a major role in building consumer relationships by placing brands in the middle of a consumer&rsquo;s purchasing journey. <u> Great content</u> will provide answers to consumer&rsquo;s questions or help them with a challenge. By providing <u> relevant content</u> related to their purchase you are instantly building a positive relationship.Here&rsquo;s another reason why consumers view brands as relationships&hellip;<h3> 2. They Have Moved Beyond Traditional Marketing to User Generated Demand</h3>Today user-generated content is more trustworthy than traditional media. Simply put, consumers believe that high-end productions are fabricated and only convey the positive attributes of the product or service advertised. Overall, they would rather trust their peers than brands.There was a significant market shift after the financial meltdown. Consumers lost trust in major corporations when financial and housing institution&rsquo;s unethical business practices were exposed. There was a negative connotation to the word &lsquo;corporation&rsquo; and consumers felt bamboozled.Do you recall the <u> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street\" target=\"_blank\">  Occupy Wall Street </a></u> movement?Ever since that movement, companies across all business sectors had to revamp their communication strategies. The were forced to become more transparent.And that&rsquo;s where the shift began.Consumers wanted their voices heard and, as a result, it shaped our current market situation. Companies transferred the power to the people and had them play a key role in the companies product offerings.After this trend caught fire, many companies begin to leverage the consumer voice when developing new products.Perhaps the light-hearted <u> <a href=\"http://www.dousaflavor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Lay&rsquo;s Do Us A Flavor </a></u> campaign is the best example.<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4ukacCvubss \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-09-at-10.16.56-AM.png\" width=\"634\"/></a>Now on to the third reason why consumers view brands as relationships&hellip;<h3> 3. They Have Moved Beyond Traditional Service Transactions to Personal Interactions</h3>Let&rsquo;s face it. Customer service transactions have changed forever. Now consumers expect to have their problems resolved without ever calling or email customer service.They are taking their grievances to social media as it naturally amplifies their voice. Mainly, social media complaints can become viral and damage the relationship other consumers as well.As a result, companies have become proactive in solving consumer problems before a formal complaint is conducted.Particularly, this is done through active <u> social listening</u> and remedied with very personal interaction.Southwest Airlines is known for personal interactions with passengers. The airline works to ensure they are making travel human by showing that the airline is made of fabulous people flying other people.It has established a Social Care Team with full-time employees that provide extraordinary customer service.This team utilizes a social media command center to actively listen and respond to customers.But this is not limited to social media, a Southwest Airlines flight attendant turned a traditional service transaction into a personal interaction. Take a look. This video has over 20 million views!<a href=\"https://youtu.be/07LFBydGjaM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-09-at-10.28.46-AM.png\" width=\"634\"/></a>Click to view.Here&rsquo;s the last reason why consumers view brands as relationships&hellip;<h3> 4. They Have Moved Beyond Product Transactions to Human Interactions</h3>There Is No More B2B or B2C. Its H2H Human to Human. If you&rsquo;ve been in the sales industry, you are familiar with the term, sell the sizzle not the steak. (Unless its <u> <a href=\"http://www.gibsonssteakhouse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gibson&rsquo;s </a></u> Stakehouse in Chicago. No need for any sizzle on that steak. Best steak I ever had)OK let&rsquo;s get back on track.Nike is known for selling the sizzle. It communicates how its products can help you reach your athletic and fitness goals. For example, it created communities around the <u> Nike+</u> product which serves as a platform for runners with shared interest.<a href=\"https://youtu.be/BSWeAUA4uVk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-09-at-10.36.00-AM.png\" width=\"631\"/></a>Click to view.Understand how Nike has created a community around their product and see if you can create something similar for your product or service. Consumers will naturally feel more comfortable using your product when they know there&rsquo;s a community of fellow consumers&rsquo; along with them.Overall, implementing human interaction will foster stronger relationships and increase brand loyalty.<h3> Final Thoughts</h3>Your consumers are prioritizing organic discovery, user generated demand, personal and human interactions. This means you should prioritize engagement when developing your marketing strategies.Engagement is key.The type of engagement that goes beyond the traditional marketing tactics and complements your consumer&rsquo;s values and expectations. There is a reason why consumers view brands as relationships.Brands are starting to engage with consumers in ways in which they wish to be engaged.The days of one-way communication are done. The relationship begins when both the brand and consumer are on equal footing. The only way this is accomplished is if a brand becomes more human and more personal. You know, the stuff that built the great relationships people have today. This process is no different.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-09 17:37:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-09 17:37:01.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_wDviTdI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-reasons-why-consumers-view-brands-as-relationships/\", \"post_id\": \"4617\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-09 17:37:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-09 17:37:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-reasons-why-consumers-view-brands-as-relationships\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4613\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2062\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436303892196-e039f81a04aa-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"625\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436540400,"author_id":258,"chart_url":""}

Which begs the question: why would anyone make a special effort to do business with them? On the other hand, when a company does care&mdash;and they consistently show it&mdash;they definitely stand out from their competitors, and customers are naturally attracted to them. We hear it all the time:  &ldquo;That company really cares about its products. Or, that company really cares about its employees.  Or, that company really cares about its customers.&rdquo;</p><p> Consider this: Anita Roddick, the founder of The Body Shop, vowed that sincere and earnest caring would forever remain not just a nice idea, but a critical component of her company&rsquo;s brand.  &ldquo;We care passionately about our people, products, customers and community,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and passion persuades!&rdquo;</p><h3> Question: How does a company develop a culture of caring?</h3><p> <br/> Answer: I believe caring has to start on the inside of an organization and then work its way out to the customer. It&rsquo;s a beautiful, predictable human chain of events, and it works like this: In the long run, employees can&rsquo;t treat their customers or each other any better than they themselves are being treated by the company. If a company&rsquo;s leaders and managers respect and take good care of the employees, then the employees will respect and take good care of their customers, and the customers will respect and take good care of the company. </p><p> <strong>  Demonstrate you care on the inside by taking the time to: </strong></p><li> Articulate an exciting vision and mission for your people</li><li> Devote one-on-one time with your employees and support their personal growth and development</li><li> Reward and recognize progress</li><li> Hold your employees accountable and speak the truth <br/>  </li><h3> Encourage creativity, innovation and breakthrough thinking</h3>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-09 17:32:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-09 17:32:53.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_QWTzcjb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/caring-is-a-huge-competitive-advantage/\", \"post_id\": \"4612\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-09 17:32:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-09 17:32:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"caring-is-a-huge-competitive-advantage\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4611\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2061\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1436379597301-690adc63f244-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1053\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436527800,"author_id":325,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2029,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Doors You Need To Close In Social Media","link":"5-doors-you-need-to-close-in-social-media","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarjiJSherman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Marji Sherman  </u> </a></p><p> There&rsquo;s a place in Wisconsin that has held my heart since I was a little girl. It&rsquo;s an old monastery buried in the woods with Italian marble statues of religious figures and a beautiful place to pray set against ferns, hills and wildflowers. Every time I make it back to the Midwest, I insist that my mom and I take the incredibly gorgeous drive to the monastery where she witnessed many weddings and important moments in her own life growing up.</p><p> I was lucky enough to visit last weekend, and as I knelt to say my prayers in the middle of nature, I thought of all of the half-open doors in my life. I was in a place where I felt like I had one foot in so many doors, that I wasn&rsquo;t able to have two in any. With everything swirling around me, I knew it was time to ask God to guide me through the multiple doors because I could not give my whole self to anyone or anything with half of myself everywhere else. I prayed for God to close the doors that needed to be closed in my life, and assured him that I would listen to him once He closed them and not go back and try to open them again. The latter is a very important part to the prayer, because I have a bit of a stubborn edge to me that does not like necessarily listening to God even though he has red sirens going off telling me to stay away from certain doors.</p><p> Literally one hour after I said the prayer, a very significant door from the past year of my life slammed shut. While I immediately wanted to find out why, I remembered my prayer, and accepted the shut door. Over the past week, three more have been nailed shut by circumstances. Now, that is a &ldquo;be careful what you ask for&rdquo; moment!</p><p> However, even just a week later, I can see the benefit of the shut doors and I understand exactly why they needed to close and what God is doing. It&rsquo;s like a light bulb went off, &ldquo;Okay, God. Yea, you do know what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p><p> Doors have to close in order for new growth to be nurtured. I strongly believe this door closing philosophy is important in the social media world. Not only on a personal level with thousands of doors opening with the click of a button, but on a brand level, as well, with all of the new technology and tools right at our fingertips. Here&rsquo;s five ideals that brands need to shut the door on:</p><h3> Being On Every Single Social Media Site</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve always said that the absolute worst thing for a brand to do is open a social network on every single platform. First off, not every type of brand works well on every type of platform. Second off, unless you have the budget to hire an army of the best strategists and community managers, you will not be able to sustain valuable content and conversation on each network.</p><h3> Believing An App Is Necessary </h3><p> <br/> I heard a rumor once that the majority of apps are downloaded, and then never used again after the first week of being downloaded. Whether or not that is true, I think we can all agree that not every brand belongs in an app on someone&rsquo;s phone. A few months ago, I had a brainstorming session to create an app for an insurance company. There were four teams pitted against each other to create the best app. Within fifteen minutes, each team discovered that most of their brilliant ideas for apps were already part of the elementary iPhone and iWatch apps. So unless you really see a differentiator for your brand in the app space, stay away. Plus, it&rsquo;s a super costly endeavor to come back with an app that does not work or set itself apart.</p><h3> Being The Next Oreo </h3><p> <br/> This is a super huge pet-peeve of mine. Yes, Oreo did an incredible job with their &ldquo;dunk in the dark&rdquo; post during the blackout at the superbowl, but COME ON, people. Don&rsquo;t be on social just to make it onto Mashable. Chances are, if you focus on the uniqueness of your brand and your own way of doing social, you will make it there anyway. Chances are, if you go out to copy Oreo, or be better than them, you will end up on Mashable in a light you might not want to be seen in.</p><h3> Being Overly Valuable</h3><p> <br/> Yes, absolutely, you need to add value to the lives of your consumers on social &rarr; or you shouldn&rsquo;t be on it. You also need to remember that your consumers have many other brands they use and many other things they are thinking of throughout their day. Some brands make the mistake of thinking they need to be in the day-to-day, hour-to-hour of their consumers&rsquo; lives when that is definitely not the case. Provide value when you can, but remember that you are only a small sliver of that consumer&rsquo;s life. Think of creating concentrated valuable content that really breaks the mold of the consumer&rsquo;s day, so when you do send something out, they are eager to pay attention to it.</p><h3> Focusing On The Negative</h3><p> <br/> This is a really important topic to me, so important that it will most likely be a post of its own very soon. We are wired to focus on the negative, and that wiring carries right into board meetings with the C-suite and our view of our work. We already have one thing going against us as social media strategists&rarr; People are way more likely to go on social and post about a brand when it&rsquo;s a negative experience. So, we already are seeing more negative just due to our own wiring. Make an effort to look for the positive in your trends, metrics reports and overall evaluation of your social landscape. These don&rsquo;t have to be super bowl moments &rarr; they can be anything from a compliment from a consumer to a conversation that kept someone engaged with your brand for a longer amount of time. I suggest keeping track of the positives and sharing them on a weekly basis with your team to increase morale and enthusiasm for the brand.</p><p> It&rsquo;s amazing how much more time you will have to create quality content and conversations if you allow some doors to close, and stay closed. I&rsquo;m not telling you it&rsquo;s easy to let go of certain things, but there is definitely an advantage in the long run as you see even better doors open up in the future.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-09 17:08:54.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-09 17:08:54.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Sq5S19S.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-doors-you-need-to-close-in-social-media/\", \"post_id\": \"4610\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-09 17:08:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-09 17:08:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-doors-you-need-to-close-in-social-media\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4609\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2060\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/closed-doors.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1347\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436544000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2028,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Fintech March Into Investment Banking","link":"the-fintech-march-into-investment-banking","source_link":null,"content":"One of the readers of the Finanser saw my write-up on asset and wealth management, and asked if I could talk about what&rsquo;s happening in investment banking.  Answer: yes, I can.It&rsquo;s more difficult to see the Fintech stars and unicorns in the investment space however, as it&rsquo;s more opaque having been disrupted by technology fundamentally over the past twenty years.  The rise of program then algorithmic and now high frequency trading created a strong move to low latency, server farms co-located along with the Exchanges.  The Exchanges themselves were attacked by new Fintech firms like BATS, Chi-X, NASDAQ and more, and these companies are now dominating much of the equities trading areas.  Trading on BATS in the USA now represents <u> <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150108005945/en/BATS-Global-Markets-Sets-Full-Year-Market-Share#.VZ0HMflViko\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  20% of all equities </a></u>, doubling their market share in just two years by acquiring Direct Edge.  Pretty good for a ten-year old garage Fintech start-up based in Kansas.  Similarly, in Europe, BATS Chi-X trading now <u> <a href=\"https://www.batstrading.co.uk/market_data/market_share/index/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  exceeds </a></u> the London Stock Exchange and Euronext, not bad for an eight year old start-up.Admittedly these guys are owned by institutions &ndash; BATS lists GETCO as its largest shareholder. Other owners include Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG, Nomura Holdings and Citigroup.   The same with Chi-X that was initially launched under the leadership of Nomura and investments from BNP Paribas, Citadel, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Fortis, GETCO, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Optiver, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale and UBS.  In other words, the low latency high frequency markets are pretty much dominated by players that are owned by the market makers.But then you do have a large volume of day traders, spread betting, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Direct Market Access (DMA), that wasn&rsquo;t there before.  That&rsquo;s also a Fintech change.<strong> It isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d call Fintech itself however, as these are all offshoots of trading structures rather than companies that are creating new business models in the way we see with Betterment and Wealthfront (who got into an argument  <u>  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jonstein/betterment-sets-the-record-straight-d66deb96fad2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this week  </a> </u> , which I think Wealthfront just lost).</strong><h3> In this area, there are three emerging markets of real Fintech change: social trading strategies, market funding platforms and market data services.</h3>In the area of trading strategies, we saw early innovators like ZuluTrader, eToro and Stocktwits became accepted very quickly as new forms of social trading.<u> <a href=\"http://socialtradingguru.com/zulutrade\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ZuluTrade </a></u> is probably the largest global social trading network at the moment, both in terms of numbers of traders and investors. Offers full trade copying (supporting multiple brokers) and social interaction capabilities with free fully functioning demo.<u> <a href=\"http://socialtradingguru.com/etoro\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  eToro </a></u> is very much focussed at the novice investors with eToro acting as both broker and social trading network.

As mentioned, this market is also getting funding from the large institutional investors too, so it&rsquo;s more a way of de-risking early round funding than necessarily creating an alternative market to the core equities markets.All in all, trading strategies, trading analytics and alternative finance are the three big Fintech categories for me in the investment and capital markets space, on top of the low latency, high frequency changes we have seen in the last decade.  It also means that the investment markets are being just as radically changed by Fintech as the retail and commercial bank space, and asset and wealth management space.

Many have a burgeoning social presence on the likes of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, helping them interact with customers to drive news and promote products.</p><p> In July 2012,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.morganstanley.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Morgan Stanley  </a> </u>  announced plans to enable its financial advisors to communicate with customers via social channels, Twitter and LinkedIn.</p><p> Other examples include, Zecco, the online stock brokerage which enables its customers to trade through Facebook; Ameriprise, the financial advisory firm, which offers an adviser search tool on LinkedIn; and both E*Trade and optionsXpress have launched social communities.</p><p> However, compared with other sectors&rsquo; adoption of social, FS businesses are trailing. Compliance is a huge reason, but further factors contributing to hesitancy include the fact that social opens up the organisations to criticism. </p><h3> The opportunity</h3><p> <br/> The proliferation of smartphones and tablets means that today&rsquo;s consumer is digitally savvy, sees social as an inherent skill and expects to be communicated to in such a fashion.</p><p> The fact is, a firm will not be considered relevant in the current economy if it fails to communicate where stakeholders &ndash; clients, investors, business partners, media and industry peers &ndash; are listening.</p><p> People and businesses now have a much larger arena to communicate in, voicing opinions in real time and a financial brand must be part of this conversation.</p><h3> Embracing social</h3><p> <br/> Social certainly brings compliance challenges for financial institutions, but there are simple steps a business can take to overcome them.</p><p> However, ultimately, the reduction in social risk boils down to the ability to capture and control the information flowing in and out of an organisation&rsquo;s social channels.</p><p> Further, compliance laws require the monitoring of two-way communications between financial advisors, customers and potential prospects. This sounds daunting on paper, but the good news is that FS organisations should not fear these stipulations, as we are now at the stage where technologies are available to manage these processes while monitoring all outbound information through textual analysis, interpreting whether a user has communicated inappropriately.</p><p> Social cannot be ignored and the financial firms that get to grips with it, in a compliant fashion, will reap the benefits.</p><p> It gives FS firms the opportunity to create an online presence that can be heard amongst a large mass of people and company leaders an efficient way to deliver a company message, create transparency, and engage in a two-way conversation.</p><p> Communication has evolved and businesses that fail to embrace this new world order will get left behind as consumers&rsquo; social expectations continue to escalate. It&rsquo;s quite simple &ndash; FS businesses must adapt to integrate social, or face being left behind as competitors seize the opportunity.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-08 18:41:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-08 18:41:58.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_uouCRMU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-financial-firms-should-embrace-social-media-not-fear-it/\", \"post_id\": \"4606\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-08 18:41:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-08 18:41:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-financial-firms-should-embrace-social-media-not-fear-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4605\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2058\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/socialmediawordofmouth.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"445\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436438700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

But how can interactive video be used in education?</p><p> In March 2011 Salman Khan, who created  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Khan Academy  </a> </u> , proposed that we use &ldquo;video to reinvent education&rdquo;. He recognised the benefits of using video for learning online such as learning at the learner's pace, accessibility and flexibility.</p><p> However, this \"reinvention\" has been claimed many times before. Thomas Edison said way back in 1922 that the &ldquo;motion picture is destined to revolutionise our educational system and... in a few years it will supplant largely, if not entirely, the use of textbooks &rdquo;. In their 1994 book  <u>  <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MB0iAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=using+video+in+interactive+education+1994&amp;dq=using+video+in+interactive+education+1994&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WHaWVZTcGaOy7Qbu25aQAw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Using interactive video in education  </a> </u> , Penelope Semrau and Barbara A. Boyer claimed that video discs would revolutionise what happens in the classroom of tomorrow.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/VideoDisc-education.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></p><p> Tomorrow's world: The video disc.</p><p> Despite these claims, education as we know it has remained largely unchanged as a result of these &lsquo;revolutions&rsquo;. But that has all changed. The Khan Academy does offer something unique: the opportunity for students to interact. Learners can now answer questions and get instant feedback about their input through &lsquo;state-of-the-art, adaptive technology&rsquo; that identifies strengths and learning gaps. The Khan Academy is now incredibly successful, with millions of users across the globe and thousands of courses ranging from calculus to cosmology. They&rsquo;ve also formed extraordinary partnerships with  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/nasa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NASA  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/tate/meet-500-years\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tate Gallery  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/mit-k12\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MIT  </a> </u> .</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/video-education-khan-academy-nasa.jpg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> NASA have teamed up with Khan Academy to use their video content in lessons about the universe.</p><p> One of the reasons behind the Khan Academy&rsquo;s success is that it transformed the passive viewer into an engaged learner. A raft of other tools now exist like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.zaption.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Zaption  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://huzzaz.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Huzzaz  </a> </u>  that allow producers to create whole lessons including quizzes, resources, and analytics to track progress. The best examples of these tools facilitate what is essential for any learning environment, online or otherwise:</p><h3> 1. Demonstrate visually and verbally</h3><p> <br/> Video appeals to different learning styles and allows producers to both show and tell.</p><h3> 2. Facilitate participation</h3><p> <br/> Once learners have seen how it&rsquo;s done they have the opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge they&rsquo;ve learnt through comprehension tests.</p><h3> 3. Allow feedback and encouragement</h3><p> <br/> Learners get instant feedback when they make decisions and answer questions, which keeps them engaged and helps them to improve.</p><h3> 4. Provide direct access to learning resources</h3><p> <br/> URLs, images and other videos are made easily available to the learner.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"478\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/khan-academy-tate-gallery-video-education2.jpg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Tate Gallery direct learners with links to other educational resources.</p><h3> 5. Track and reward progress</h3><p> <br/> Analytics provide both the educator and learner with details about their progress which helps them keep track of their progress and accomplishments.</p><p> Static, linear educational video is no longer enough for learners, especially online where  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/our-attention-span-is-now-less-than-that-of-a-goldfish-microsoft-study-finds-10247553.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   maintaining attention is a constant battle  </a> </u> .

{"original_id":2025,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Journey Maps: Not an Exercise in Futility","link":"journey-maps-not-an-exercise-in-futility","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One of the arguments against journey mapping I often hear is that it's an exercise in futility: You map. You put it on the wall. And nothing changes. To that I answer: \"You're doing it all wrong.\" <br/> <br/> You map because you need to understand the customer experience; you know that you cannot transform something you don't understand. But understanding only gets you so far. You need to act on what you now know. It's time to operationalize your maps. How? <br/> <br/> I&rsquo;m assuming that you&rsquo;ve started with what we call an  <strong>  assumptive map </strong> , which is created by internal stakeholders, without customer input. It&rsquo;s what stakeholders assume to be the steps customers go through to complete some task; it's based on what they know as customers themselves and on customer feedback and other customer data. This is a common starting point for maps. And it's a common place for mappers to stumble and spiral into futile territory. Keep going. <br/> <br/> The map must include more than just what the customer is doing, thinking, and feeling. In order for it to be actionable, you'll want to include various  <strong>  artifacts </strong> , e.g., pictures, invoices, packing slips, receipts, emails, call recordings, etc., as well as <strong>   touchpoint data, customer data, and customer feedback. </strong> These items bring the map to life and really help those who will be using it analyze and prioritize improvement opportunities. <br/> <br/> The immediate next step for this type of map is to do some  <strong>  customer research. </strong> You absolutely have to  <strong>  validate the map </strong>  with your customers to make sure that the customer voice is heard and visualized as part of the mapping process. At this point, you&rsquo;ll likely also uncover a desired future state, according to the customer. Hold that thought, though. Let's focus on current state first. <br/> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve got customer input &ndash; and not before &ndash; you&rsquo;re ready to ask, &ldquo;What do I do now?&rdquo; <br/> <br/> With the maps, you&rsquo;ve identified things that are going well and those that aren&rsquo;t.  <strong>  Coach and train employees </strong>  on these areas: keep doing the things you're doing well, but make improvements where you're falling down.  <strong>  Set up surveys and other listening posts </strong>  to get feedback on those key moments of truth, especially those areas where you need more data for a clearer understanding of what&rsquo;s going well and what isn&rsquo;t. This feedback will amp up your coaching and training, making it much clearer for employees on what needs to change. <br/> <br/> Probably the most important thing to do next is to <strong>   socialize the maps. </strong> This is key to avoiding that \"exercise in futility\" mentality or outcome. Help the entire organization &ndash; executives, frontline, back office &ndash; understand what the current customer experience is today. Share the maps with the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/04/do-you-know-who-your-customers-are.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   personas  </a> </u>  attached to drive awareness and to bring the customer to life. Incorporate maps into meetings, presentations, onboarding, and training. And talk about recommendations for change as a result of the maps. Get the entire organization onboard and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/05/getting-everyone-on-same-cx-page.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   on the same page  </a> </u> . Use the maps to provide a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/09/6-tools-to-create-clear-line-of-sight.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   clear line of sight  </a> </u>  for employees to the customer experience, how their contributions matter and how they impact the customer experience, good or bad. <br/> <br/> Those  <strong>  key moments of truth </strong>  are the areas you&rsquo;ll want to begin to focus on. What&rsquo;s happening to break down the journey at those moments? What  <strong>  processes </strong>  &ndash; both for the customer and behind the scenes &ndash; do you need to fix, update, or remove in order to simplify the journey and reduce customer effort and pain? You&rsquo;ll have to prioritize based on what&rsquo;s most important to your customers and, ultimately, to the business. And determine among those what is most doable, i.e., assess ROI of pain points and of modifications. <br/> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve agreed on those areas to focus improvement efforts on, create a  <strong>  roadmap </strong>  and make sure you have  <strong>  identified owners </strong>  for each area. (You should have assigned owners during the mapping process; if not, do it now.) Who is responsible for that particular touchpoint or interaction? At this point, you may need to  <strong>  map micro-journeys </strong>  to delve deeper into the steps customers take to complete the task: better understanding leads to a more effective transformation. And you&rsquo;ll also likely create some <strong>   process maps </strong>  to get a better understanding of what&rsquo;s supporting that experience from behind the scenes. <br/> <br/> Hopefully that gets you pointed in the right direction and helps you see how maps are actionable and are an important tool in your customer experience transformation efforts. Once you start making improvements, be sure to  <strong>  update the maps </strong>  so that they always reflect the current state. <br/> <br/> A few closing thoughts... <br/> <br/> As we know, improving the customer experience happens in baby steps; you&rsquo;ll need to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/09/help-my-execs-dont-get-it.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   build your business case and show some quick wins  </a> </u> . Maps can help with that. Pick a task and design the future state based on what customers have told you.

{"original_id":2024,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advanced Marketers Are Using Strategy Differently","link":"advanced-marketers-are-using-strategy-differently","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Although objectives and goals are still the true measure of success for marketing, I have seen an evolution in the approach that advanced marketers take toward strategy. Instead of strategies being outlined as  <strong>  having </strong>  the answers that will achieve objectives and goals, advanced marketers now see strategies as the  <strong>  path to finding </strong>  the answers.</p><p> Let me back up a little to give context. There are many ways that I have seen marketers put together a marketing plan, from a 1 page document all the way to 100+ page presentations. But to simplify things there are three primary items I see most advanced marketers focus on: objectives, goals, and strategies.</p><p> The approach advanced marketers take toward objectives and goals has not changed much &mdash; figure out what you need to achieve (i.e. objectives) and determine how to measure it (i.e. goals). But outlining what they are going to do in order to achieve their objectives and goals (i.e. the strategies), has evolved significantly.</p><h3> The Rules for Strategy Have Changed.</h3><p> <br/> Advanced marketers no longer treat strategies as absolutes. Instead of stating &ldquo;we will do A to achieve our objectives and goals&rdquo; you now see an approach of &ldquo;we will test A, B, and C&rdquo; or &ldquo;we will figure out if A, B, or C will work.&rdquo; It seems like a subtle difference, but it is not.</p><p> The old way to thinking about marketing strategy is predicated on already having the answers and just executing on them. &ldquo;A will work, so just do it&rdquo; is much different than &ldquo;we will learn what works best to apply it forward.&rdquo; The mentality toward marketing as a whole is truly different &ndash; it is now about constantly learning.</p><p> The new way of thinking about strategy is scary for most. As a marketer, it could be hard to admit that marketing does not have the answers. But when framed correctly, it becomes very clear that our job is to use the tools and resources available to find a way to the answers.</p><h3> Why Have the Rules Changed?</h3><p> <br/> Digital makes everything much, much more fluid. So when a marketing team puts together a plan, they are working within an environment that has the following:</p><li> Customers, partners, and competitors are reacting in real-time</li><li> Data is available at unprecedented amounts</li><li> New solutions for marketers to use are becoming available almost daily</li><li> Expectations for marketing results are no longer a nice-to-have, they are a must-have <br/>  </li><p> What does this all mean? It means there is a constant change occurring across many dimensions that makes it impossible to have an absolute right answer. What worked before might not work again. Which means every marketer facing this uphill battle focuses on what can be controlled &ndash;&gt; what you plan to learn and apply forward.</p><h3> Sounds Great, But I Am Not Sure I Buy It.</h3><p> <br/> All you have to do is look around at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://chiefmartec.com/2015/01/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Marketing Technology Landscape  </a> </u>  by Scott Brinker and you will see it loud and clear. A majority of the categories are focused on delivering insights as well as real-time &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; back to the market. And if you look at the evolution of this  <u>  <a href=\"http://chiefmartec.com/post_images/marketing_technology_landscape.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   landscape since 2011  </a> </u> , you will see not only new companies, but completely new categories have surfaced due to this change in the marketing environment.</p><h3> So Now What Should I Do?</h3><p> <br/> Look at your marketing plan. Are the strategies outlined meant to find the answers or are they giving them? If there is no hint at experimentation, learning, or some type of testing of assumptions, then you might want to revisit what your actual plan is setting you up for in the long term.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-08 17:44:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-08 17:44:14.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_TLKPcHR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advanced-marketers-are-using-strategy-differently/\", \"post_id\": \"4597\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-08 17:44:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-08 17:44:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advanced-marketers-are-using-strategy-differently\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4596\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2055\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1435224572021-b229e8e0760e-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"370\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436443200,"author_id":438,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2023,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Four Reasons You Need to Become a Servant Leader","link":"four-reasons-you-need-to-become-a-servant-leader","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say thank you. In between, the leader is a servant.&rdquo; &mdash;Max de Pree</p><h3> Servant Leadership</h3><p> <br/> Leadership is a privilege and may say more about your character than any other action you might take. What makes servant leadership different than any other form of leadership? Servant leaders focus on meeting the needs of others rather than gaining fame, fortune, and power for themselves. They recognize that every employee has value. They care about everyone who interacts with the organization. They listen to and respect those they work with. To be a servant leader, a heart and mind for service has to be ingrained in your core values. Here are four reasons you need to be a servant leader.</p><h3> Influence</h3><p> <br/> Henry Drummond believed, &ldquo;The people who influence you are the people who believe in you.&rdquo; Leadership is based on an ability to influence. Servant leaders influence others based on the building of trusting and respectful relationships. They show employees that they believe in them. Their leadership builds consensus and collaboration. Servant leaders understand that everyone needs to be encouraged and truly cared for on an individual level. They know that people can accomplish amazing things when they are inspired by a purpose beyond themselves. Servant leaders do right by their people, and their people do right by the organization. These leaders put themselves where they can influence by doing the most good for those they lead and by giving others something to believe in.</p><h3> Empowerment</h3><p> <br/> Bill Gates tells us, &ldquo;As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others.&rdquo; Servant leaders provide the support system and resources that employees need to do their jobs and then give them control over their own work. They are the opposite of command and control leaders; they lead by empowering, encouraging, and serving. Their aim is to equip and bring out the best in others. Servant leaders help others become engaged so that they can make their own positive impact. When employees feel empowered, they take ownership of their work; this ownership, improves morale, productivity, and quality.</p><h3> Example</h3><p> <br/> Jeffrey Gitomer explained, &ldquo;Management&rsquo;s job is to convey leadership&rsquo;s message in a compelling and inspiring way. Not just in meetings, but also by example.&rdquo; You are setting the leadership example. Servant leaders share their knowledge, help others in any way they can, and give of their time and resources to everyone. Their humble, selfless example of leadership builds teams of individuals who also want to be of service to others. This service brings people together and creates a unity that is inspiring, productive, and engaging.</p><h3> Strengths and weaknesses</h3><p> <br/> Zig Ziglar advised us, &ldquo;Try to look at your weakness and convert it into your strength. That&rsquo;s success.&rdquo; You have strengths, but you also have weaknesses. Servant leaders recognize where they are best able to help others, and where others are best able to help them. They use their strengths to meet the needs of others. And, they provide the tools and learning opportunities needed for employees to grow their own strengths and abilities. Servant leaders serve and support behind the scenes, allowing employees a sense of accomplishment and control.</p><h3> Become a Servant</h3><p> <br/> Making it your primary role to serve others is both satisfying and productive. Becoming a servant leader shows strength of character. It builds strong relationships and develops servant leaders throughout your organization. Becoming a servant increases your influence, empowers employees, sets an inspiring example, and allows you to focus on serving where your strengths lie.</p><p> <strong>  What can you do to start serving today? </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-08 17:40:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-08 17:40:42.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_rBArQja.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/four-reasons-you-need-to-become-a-servant-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"4595\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-08 17:40:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-08 17:40:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"four-reasons-you-need-to-become-a-servant-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4594\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2054\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Found_855293808_2036549.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"723\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436461200,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2022,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want Better Sales & Customer Relationships? Do This One Thing.","link":"want-better-sales-customer-relationships-do-this-one-thing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Improving sales and strengthening engagement with customers requires a range of good practices. But all the \"best practices\" in the world can't deliver maximum benefit when an organization does not have a healthy flow of communication. Short term, lack of good communication between organizational departments may not have too much of an effect, but long term, it can seriously limit customer engagement and business growth. <br/> <br/> In fact, if you want to increase sales and improve customer relationships, improving internal communication is one of the most important steps you can take. Other actions taken to gain customers and improve sales can fall flat if they're not built on a foundation of good communication flow between departments.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Risks of Sales Teams Working in Isolation </strong> <br/> <br/> When sales teams work in isolation, they may not realize how good-faith actions for improving sales can sometimes backfire. Suppose your sales team is set to attend an important trade show. Sure, they may work with the marketing department to develop promotions and marketing collateral, but if they don't also communicate with the production and customer service departments, trade show success could be seriously compromised. <br/> <br/> If a successful trade show appearance results in an influx of new orders with no warning to the production department, the result could be inadequate or slow order fulfillment and new customers who are immediately turned off. Spillover could affect the customer service department as well, who could be faced with an increase in unhappy customers calling. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Reasons for Lack of Cross-Departmental Communication </strong> <br/> <br/> There are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.discoverysurveys.com/articles/itw-017.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   many reasons why departments remain in \"silos\"  </a> </u>  and don't communicate with each other. Personal conflict between departmental managers can silence cross-departmental communication, as can common stereotypes some departments embrace about other departments. It's easy for the sales department to think that the production department has it easy, and vice versa, and in organizations where there is excessive pressure for speed and productivity, employees may simply feel like they don't have the time to share important information. And too often, many companies develop and document departmental procedures that completely ignore the importance of communication from one department to another. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Benefits of Communication Across Departments </strong> <br/> <br/> Effective internal communication  <u>  <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-communication-between-different-departments-organization-11901.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   builds trust among the departments in an organization  </a> </u> . Better trust leads to less second-guessing between departments that can lead to unnecessary fact checking and ultimately to slowed productivity. Internal communication should be built on a foundation of reliability and honesty from the start. Accurate and timely exchange of information helps the organization meet sales projections, distribute products optimally, and meet terms of contracts that everyone understands. The smoother cross-departmental communication is, the higher the overall efficiency of the organization. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Example: How Sales Can Help Production Anticipate Increased Orders </strong> <br/> <br/> Suppose, as illustrated above, the sales team is soon to attend an important trade show. Early in the planning stages for the company's booth or presentation, communication with the production department can help prevent major problems. Perhaps a piece of production equipment is scheduled for replacement, which will cause a temporary slowdown in production. Knowing the sales team's plan can help the production department schedule equipment replacement so as to minimize interference with new orders that can be expected after the trade show. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Example: How Customer Service Department Input Can Help With Business Development </strong> <br/> <br/> When there is strong communication between the customer service department and the sales team, sales professionals can make use of the many insights customer service develops from talking to actual customers day in and day out. Perhaps several customers who call in for help with a product mention great satisfaction with a particular feature of a product. Sales teams can make use of this knowledge when developing sales leads. Ensuring there are channels available for customer service and sales to communicate easily is a simple way to help sales teams understand real-world use of a company's products and craft sales presentations accordingly. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Conclusion </strong> <br/> <br/> When your sales team has a powerful, solution-oriented approach to selling, ensuring proper communication flow among departments can help ensure that new customers receive their products and services on time with outstanding customer service after the sale.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.getcsc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CSC  </a> </u> 's consultative sales certification coaching helps your sales team develop and polish their core competencies and more importantly, apply them on the job and realize impressive results. When your sales professionals have the skills to achieve their goals, great communication among departments in your company ensures that those sales lead to happy customers and achievement of overall business goals.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-08 17:31:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-08 17:31:09.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_2KNEZIF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-better-sales-customer-relationships-do-this-one-thing/\", \"post_id\": \"4593\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-08 17:31:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-08 17:31:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-better-sales-customer-relationships-do-this-one-thing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4592\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2053\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/287-lg-2.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"491\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436441400,"author_id":319,"chart_url":""}

And this might be a reason for alarm. But, if you look at the percentage of the increase related to diagnostic tests and corrective instead of preventative treatments, there&rsquo;s reason for hope. And that reason lies in the new world of wearable technology that will alert us to problems and motivate us to make lifestyle changes before we get sick.</p><h3> What the economists are missing is the impact that wearable diagnostics are going to have on healthcare costs.</h3><p> <br/> You know about  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/store?gclid=CjwKEAjw4-SrBRDP483GvreDr2ASJAD5sCIuGOq4eQUQaoJxBGcZZEcYDVjzZWSbEOVslKd_Z3uudhoCrXbw_wcBSen\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fitbit  </a> </u> , the app that helps you get in shape by tracking the number of steps you take, tracks your heart rate, calories burned, and stairs climbed.

And, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.valencell.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PerformTek heart-rate monitor  </a> </u>  which uses biometric sensor technology to measure your heart-rate while doing any exercise and in any environment.</p><p> Sleep troubles? The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www2.withings.com/us/en/products/aura?\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Withing&rsquo;s Aura sleep pad  </a> </u>  diagnoses the quality of your REM cycle and helps you to wake up easily at the best time in your sleep cycle.  An app by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sleeprate.com/sleep-tracking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sleeprate  </a> </u>  assesses the quality of your sleep and provides you with a sleep improvement plan.

{"original_id":2019,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Hate Setting Goals? Do This.","link":"hate-setting-goals-do-this","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As my clients know, I like goals. Not vague fantasies about the future with no plans of getting there. Actual, tangible, measurable goals. The problem most people face is that they don&rsquo;t know the difference. A goal is a dream on steroids. In other words, a goal has a strategy, a plan, and action steps.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve ever set a fuzzy goal in the past and haven&rsquo;t achieved it, it&rsquo;s probably because you didn&rsquo;t do these 6 things:</p><h3> 1. You Didn&rsquo;t Set A SMART Goal.</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve all heard the acronym for (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time Limited), yet we still set goals that don&rsquo;t hit each point. For example, I was coaching a health coach who wanted to grow her business and get more clients. Her version of a SMART goal was &ldquo;Get 10 clients in 4 weeks.&rdquo; While it was specific, relevant, and time limited, it wasn&rsquo;t going to work as a goal. Why? Because there&rsquo;s too much outside of her control. It also had no specific action steps associated with it. After some back and forth, she decided that she wanted to increase her web presence to meet new clients. A better one month goal for her was to &ldquo;Take daily action steps by working for 30 minutes each day to start a blog by creating a website and mailing list.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. You Focused On Results Instead Of Actions.</h3><p> <br/> For example, a not-so-SMART goal is &ldquo;I want to lose 15 lbs this month.&rdquo; Even breaking that number down into &frac12; lb per day is pointless. Why? Because there&rsquo;s no real plan to get you there. A SMARTer goal would be to say &ldquo;For the next month, I will take daily action in the form of 30 minutes of exercise, 8 glasses of water, cooking every meal at home, and meditating for 5 minutes each day.&rdquo;</p><h3> 3. You Didn&rsquo;t Maintain Motivation.</h3><p> <br/> Motivation is an emotion, it waxes and wanes.  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/goal-motivation-worksheet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Try this exercise to tap into motivation on command  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 4. You Didn&rsquo;t Consider The Past In A Proactive Way.</h3><p> <br/> Most of us don&rsquo;t achieve every goal we set. Largely because we don&rsquo;t stop to consider what prevented us from achieving it in the past. For example, when I set a goal years ago to start my own company, I looked at all the ways I self-sabotaged in the past: not carving out specific time to work, putting others ahead of me, working in my apartment and getting distracted by chores, etc. Jot down your go-to methods of self-sabotage so you can call out your own BS.</p><h3> 5. You Didn&rsquo;t Look At The Beliefs That Previously Held You Back.</h3><p> <br/> Failures in the past create limiting beliefs which lead to roadblocks. Anticipate and address them by asking yourself:</p><li> What are the things I used to say to myself that stopped me from taking action in the past? Ex. I am selfish if I don&rsquo;t prioritize my kids over my health.</li><li> What stories do I tell myself that get me off track? Ex. I can&rsquo;t be successful as a writer, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I don't write today.</li><li> What excuses or rationalizations have I made for not taking action? Ex. I&rsquo;ll have more time to do this tomorrow. <br/>  </li><h3> 6. You Weren't Accountable.</h3><p> <br/> Announce your goal on Facebook. Check in with a friend each day to say whether or not you followed up on your actions. Sometimes we need external motivation to kick us in the ass.</p><p> <strong>  NEW BEHAVIORS AND NEW OUTCOMES START BY DOING THINGS IN A NEW WAY. </strong></p><p> And while you may have failed at your goal in the past, setting a SMART goal is an opportunity for you to handle your historical patterns differently. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to take new actions and achieve new outcomes. Because ultimately, you only fail when you don&rsquo;t start.</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-08 16:24:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-08 16:24:13.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_yfaNC63.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/hate-setting-goals-do-this/\", \"post_id\": \"4586\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-08 16:24:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-08 16:24:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"hate-setting-goals-do-this\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4587\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2050\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-2_1.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"537\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436457600,"author_id":22,"chart_url":""}

It doesn&rsquo;t mean that organisations should merge departments, but rather salespeople are starting to take on more of the demand generation piece to build their own lead funnel. Indeed, if you become influential in your niche and appear on the first page of Google, from a sales perspective you&rsquo;re enabling yourself to get more inbound leads.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Marketing Content </strong></p><p> &ldquo;For each sales professional to become an expert in their field, they will need marketing support to build their online influence and gain communities&rsquo; interest. There are different types of content marketing needs to support social selling:</p><li> Corporate-type content focusing on the company, product or service that needs to be provided to the market. Case studies can be really helpful to close a deal.</li><li> Marketing content to generate awareness, engagement and buzz in the market for those that are not aware of your company.</li><li> There also needs to be thought leadership material around your particular product or niche that could also come from pre-sales or sales, as well as marketing.</li><p> Ideally, this content should be provided to salespeople ready-built with hashtags attached for optimized employee sharing so they just need to cut and past in LinkedIn or Twitter. A lot of enterprises are doing that, and it is working well.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Marketing Automation </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Marketing automation is also fundamentally changing the way that we at Oracle are able to move contacts from outbound marketing to leads through a nurturing program. From a cold calling perspective, in the past we were getting a response rate of 5% of people that were ready to talk to us, and another 25% who were not ready and asking to be called again later. These days, we&rsquo;re able to nurture these 25% through the marketing automation process and turn them into leads. We thus can take the ROI of calling 100 accounts from 5% to 30%. Marketing automation takes a long time to put in place and implement, but it is worth the investment if you want to see that level of ROI, in terms of the number of leads that you are going to get.</p><p> We used to use BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timescale) to qualify a lead in the past at Oracle, but we&rsquo;ve changed that recently. With social media and the advancement of cloud technology (enabling to switch on the product immediately), the sale cycle is getting shorter and has moved from 12 to 6 to 3 months. A lead now is an appointment with a customer that will have a need and authority and it is the responsibility of  the salesperson to create the desire. It is that level of speed that you need to play in today&rsquo;s market to get in front of the competition.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Q2: How can influencer marketing support social selling efforts? </strong></p><p> &ldquo;When people are doing their research in the buying process, they will talk to as many people as possible online. One of the things that sales need to work out is how to be in this short list.</p><p> A starting point is to research the influencers in that marketplace, reach out to them and through a strategic programme, create a community around those influencers.</p><p> There are influencers within organizations, which is not new, but those people have moved from offline to online, and traditional influential organizations such as Gartner and Forrester. But, there also people like Brian Solis and Ted Rubin who have an opinion, and have gained a strong influence over the years.</p><p> The right way to involve influencers is to create a relationship and engage. You can&rsquo;t just ask someone to share, you have to listen to what they say and understand their interests. You should talk to them in a personalized way so that they know why they should be interested. You need to bring some value. The question to ask yourself is: What is it I have that you don&rsquo;t and that I can help you with?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  People buy into people, and this has not changed. </strong></p><p> &ldquo;The best thing is a face-to-face conversation as always, but you can create those relationships online. Like any relationship, it will take time to build, so don&rsquo;t expect for it to happen overnight.</p><p> The final thing is to measure &ndash; Not necessarily saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve generated 10 leads,&rdquo; but knowing where you&rsquo;ve started from and where you&rsquo;re going. There&rsquo;s a very old marketing saying, &ldquo;Load &ndash; Fire &ndash; Aim,&rdquo; meaning that unless you measure and evaluate what you are doing, you will not know what works and what does not. It may be that you have to try a variety of different approaches before hitting on the successful ones.</p><p> At Oracle, we&rsquo;ve started implementing social selling. We&rsquo;ve started small and completed a pilot on LinkedIn with a group of employees to demonstrate it to the greater group. We&rsquo;re at a point where everybody sees it as part of the job &ndash; we got over that difficulty, and it&rsquo;s become business as usual.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Q3: Where do you source your best content? </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I find that I have too much content coming to me. I am registered and subscribed to a lot of emails so it&rsquo;s usually about filtering it out &ndash; my mindset is more about eliminating than creating constantly.</p><p> But, when PwC and Deloitte come up with an interesting report, I dive into it, try to find something for my audience in that data, analyze it and form an opinion.

For example, if a company&rsquo;s client is a vlogger in their early 20s or late teens, it would be wiser to have them promote a product on Snapchat than promote on Google+.  According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/update-a-breakdown-of-the-demographics-for-each-of-the-different-social-networks-2015-06\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BI Intelligence survey  </a> </u> , 45% of Snapchat users fall into the 18-24 age range, while only 16% of Google+ users do.</p><p> <strong>  18-24 </strong>  &ndash; Ideal celebrities for this market are ones that have a large following of younger people.  Taylor Swift did a  <u>  post on Tumblr </u>  asking why Apple&rsquo;s new music program had a free period where artists were not paid.  This post gained over 89,000 likes and produced an outcry from 18-24 year olds in Swift&rsquo;s favor.  In terms of platforms, her demographic primarily uses Snapchat (45% of the app&rsquo;s users), Vine (28% of the app&rsquo;s users), and Tumblr (28% of the app&rsquo;s users).  Facebook still commands the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   most users  </a> </u>  of any social media platform. The platform has simply transformed into a much broader mix of ages, ceding much of its former power to newer apps.</p><p> <strong>  25-34 </strong>  &ndash; This age group is arguably the most marketable of all.  Influencers who typically post pictures on Instagram or Pinterest would be ideal influencers for this demographic; such as interior designers, fashion designers, or foodies like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/marthastewart/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Martha Stewart  </a> </u> . This demographic falls in the range of about 20% of users on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn and  <u>  <a href=\"http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/556dcac96da8117b4be53b46-960/agedistributionatthetopsocialnetworks.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   many more  </a> </u> .  This groups difference over others is it makes up the majority of Pinterest users (26% compared to the next highest of 21%).</p><p> <strong>  35-44 </strong>  &ndash; This demographic has a noticeable drop off in the amount of users on all social media platforms.  However, 35-44 year olds make up the majority of users on LinkedIn, and are only 1% behind the 25-34 age group on Twitter.  They also have a strong presence in Google+. Although the 35-44 age group may not have an extremely large audience on Twitter, they have enough of a presence for the celebrity&rsquo;s message to get across effectively. (For example &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kingsthings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Larry King  </a> </u> )</p><p> <strong>  45+ </strong>  &ndash; There is a large shift in the amount of users with each platform with this age group.  The top three in order are Facebook, LinkedIn and Pinterest.  An example of an influencer on Facebook and LinkedIn is  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BillGates\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bill Gates  </a> </u> , who is older and can connect better with this demographic.  For companies targeting people of this age or higher on social media, a good bet would be to promote their product through Facebook and LinkedIn.</p><p> For a more detailed look at social media demographics, check out these survey results from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the Pew Research Center  </a> </u> .</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-08 16:02:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-08 16:02:34.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_AMoxBBc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/celebrity-marketing-how-to-target-a-specific-market-using-social-media/\", \"post_id\": \"4581\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-08 16:02:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-08 16:02:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"celebrity-marketing-how-to-target-a-specific-market-using-social-media\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4580\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2048\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-08-at-9.02.20-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"659\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436469300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

First mover. Game changer. Innovator. Disruptor. Every company wants it &mdash; the end-all, be-all, industry revolutionizing, no-one-can-touch-this product or service that is so good it markets itself. It&rsquo;s a beautiful ambition, and few climb so high. But there is something that many of them have in common other than the big idea that started it all. It&rsquo;s a self-perpetuating engine of growth and financial stability, an impenetrable armor against harmful external forces, and an army of unpaid marketers that work around the clock.</p><p> Raving fans, advocates, ambassadors, evangelists &mdash; no matter what you term them, the most valuable brands in the world understand that their most loyal customers are among their most valuable assets. (Second only to investing in their employees, but that&rsquo;s another post.) These loyal customers are more likely to stick around despite increases in price, bad press, the occasional product defect or some other failing. They will actively refer and promote your brand publicly to their friends, family and strangers via word of mouth and social media. They&rsquo;ll even go to bat for you against critics and naysayers &mdash; without you ever having to ask.</p><p> A few fantastically successful brands have been slowly cultivating their loyalty engines over the last 30+ years to become a force to be reckoned with, while others have only been in business for 5 years and are already making huge waves. In one way or another, they have managed to delight and engage people around the world better than most &mdash; so it&rsquo;s worth spending a few minutes thinking about how.</p><h3> Uber</h3><p> Founded: 2009</p><p> Over the course of a single year, Uber grew six times its size. At the end of 2014, Uber was valued at $40 billion, dwarfing even Tesla&rsquo;s valuation of $28.6 billion. The company is currently operating in 300 cities in 50 countries, and is set to generate more than 1 million jobs worldwide this year &mdash; not to mention they recently raised $1.2 billion in a financing round to boost international expansion. So why are the number of Uber users growing at such an exponential rate? Just ask anyone who uses the service &mdash; but make sure you&rsquo;ve got some time set aside, because they&rsquo;ll likely talk your ear off, compel you to download the app, and give you a guided tour of all of its features before they let you go. (Could Uber&rsquo;s founders do any better?)</p><p> SOLVING A REAL PROBLEM &amp; REDEFINING A SERVICE CATEGORY IN THE PROCESS</p>City by city, Uber&rsquo;s technology and innovation is challenging the transportation status quo. We&rsquo;re offering a real alternative to a world that looks like a parking lot and moves like a traffic jam &mdash; a new mode of transportation that complements and improves the system we have today now. &mdash; Travis Kalanick, Cofounder and CEO, Uber Technologies Inc.<p> Uber provides a solution to a real problem that impacts millions of people &mdash; they have disrupted the monopoly of taxicab transportation in many cities rife with poor service and fulfillment and reinvented the experience in its entirety.</p><p> After you&rsquo;ve downloaded the Uber app, entered your method of payment and set your location, with just one tap to request a ride you can get a down-to-the-minute ETA, track its progress on the interactive map via GPS, view your driver&rsquo;s profile and contact him or her if necessary. When your ride arrives, it&rsquo;s a nice, clean car set to a comfortable interior temperature and often stocked with free water bottles. (And personally, all of my drivers have been a delight to ride with). When you&rsquo;re done there&rsquo;s no hassle &mdash; your card is charged automatically and you can rate the driver&rsquo;s performance if you wish.</p><p> The contrast of using Uber over a traditional taxi is so dramatic, it truly creates a &lsquo;wow&rsquo; experience for its customers &mdash; one so powerful they can&rsquo;t imagine going back to using a traditional taxi cab company, and they can&rsquo;t help but share the love. First-time users are almost immediately converted to evangelists. The level of word of mouth marketing and press frenzy generated organically has led one of Uber&rsquo;s investors, Bill Gurley, to remark, &ldquo;The product is so good, there is no one spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on marketing.&rdquo; Uber completely redefined what it means to use a short-term car service through and through. </p><h3> Red Bull</h3><p> Founded: 1987</p><p> In 2014, Red Bull sold more than 5.6 billion cans of its energy drink alone (an increase of 4.2% over 2013) and employed 10,410 people across the 167 countries where its product is sold. The company does over $6 billion in annual sales, has over 4.2 million YouTube subscribers, and 43+ million Facebook fans, making it one of the most popular brands on the world&rsquo;s largest social networking site. The company still enjoys the most sales in its eastern markets (Turkey, India) as well as South Africa, but it is a brand that has built worldwide appeal. How is it that a sugary, caffeinated drink has engendered so much crazy brand love?</p><p> FIRST MOVER</p><p> Inspired by drinks from the Far East, Austrian billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz created the formula of Red Bull Energy Drink which was first sold in Mateschitz&rsquo; home market, effectively birthing a totally new product category. Rockstar, Monster, and many others have entered the energy drink race in the years since, but as the first to corner the market, Red Bull continues to dominate as the energy drink leader.</p><p> A UNIQUE MARKETING CONCEPT (&amp; GREAT CONTENT)</p><p> Many industry experts will tell you that the real success of the Red Bull brand is built on genius, consumer-centric marketing. Red Bull is not just a product, it has come to represent a lifestyle that resonates wildly with their target customer &mdash; the younger side of the active, adventurous 18&ndash;34 demographic.</p><p> Mateschitz actually launched Red Bull Media House as a subsidiary media company in 2007, which now has offices in Austria and Los Angeles. The company produces a wide range of content, often video, around extreme sports. They have a roster of &ldquo;Red Bull Athletes&rdquo; and extreme-sporting events they sponsor around the world, fueling the constant generation of amazing, jaw-dropping content. Mateschitz has said he believes &ldquo;that brands need to take the phrase &lsquo;acting like a publisher&rsquo; literally.&rdquo;</p><p> Red Bull&rsquo;s strategy puts their product secondary to the activities that their target customer engages in and gets excited about, demonstrating they genuinely know, love, respect and support these extreme activities as much as their customers do. All of this together creates a swell of strong, empowering emotions focused on personal achievement, fearlessness, and pushing limits that connects powerfully with its customers.</p><h3> Apple</h3><p> Founded: 1976</p><p> Apple enjoyed a record-breaking first sales quarter this year with 74.8 million iPhones sold, making it the top-selling smartphone vendor in the world. Over the last six years, Apple has taken 62% of the smartphone industry&rsquo;s $216 billion net operating profits (Samsung was a long second with 26%). No matter the benchmark or report you&rsquo;re reading, you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find someone who disagrees that Apple is easily one of the best brands in business today, and a brand that possesses an overwhelming amount of customer loyalty. These people aren&rsquo;t just fans of Apple, they&rsquo;re Apple fanatics.  <a href=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/02/apple-users-loyal-biggest-evangelists/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  In a recent poll </a>  of smartphone users, 89% of iPhone users said they would tell their friends to buy one, and one-third of Apple users said nothing would convince them to switch and try a smartphone made by another company.</p><p> UNRELENTING COMMITMENT TO INNOVATION</p><p> Superior design, superior functionality and a delightful user experience are just a few of the elements that guide the creation of Apple&rsquo;s products, but perhaps more than anything else, Apple products redefine their categories. Under the reign of Steve Jobs, Apple was ruled by commitment to the utmost in quality and design excellence. Jobs would not introduce a product until the technology had caught up to fully realize Apple&rsquo;s vision for the ultimate product experience. Apple focused on a few enormous projects, and executed on them incredibly well.</p><p> HELPING CUSTOMERS FEEL A PART OF THE JOURNEY</p><p> Apple has always given its customers a very transparent view of the company&rsquo;s vision, its core values, and the hows and whys of the products it develops. Live-streaming events have become a cornerstone of new product launches and special announcements on Apple.com, and customer feedback opportunities are ever-present and utilized to continually improve on its products and services.</p>Get closer than ever to your customers. So close that you tell them what they need well before they realize it themselves. &mdash; Steve Jobs, former CEO, Apple<p> STELLAR CUSTOMER SERVICE</p><p> Apple also provides wonderful in-person customer service. At Apple&rsquo;s retail store Genius bars, Apple tech experts will actually walk you through how-to&rsquo;s and quick and easy fixes to common problems (if you&rsquo;d like to know), and Apple employees are actually empowered to do what&rsquo;s best for the customer, even if that might mean violating the written rules of a particular policy. </p><h3> What will drive your brand&rsquo;s loyalty engine?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s clear that Uber, Red Bull and Apple each have different market strengths and excel in different areas. But one thing they all do extremely well is pinpoint a deeply felt want or need of the audiences they seek to serve, and determine the best way to connect to, or answer, that need to the fullest extent.</p><p> In Uber&rsquo;s case, to completely solve all the inherent pains of using a taxi service, they had to redefine an entire service category and build a new system from the ground up.</p><p> For Red Bull, to connect deeply to its customers&rsquo; lifestyles and passions, its founder recognized he had to do something quite unorthodox: the product itself had to take a back seat, and investment in sponsoring extreme sports athletes, events, and creating awe-inspiring content &mdash; even launching a media house as a separate entity &mdash; had to drive the brand.</p><p> And for Apple, it was a vision to &ldquo;think different&rdquo; than everything that had come before. To seek to be the technology innovator that created a beautifully designed, simple, and utterly delightful user experience across all of its products. At the same time, the company put the customer first, inviting them in, and making them feel a part of what makes Apple, Apple (e.g., &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mac&rdquo;).</p><p> By seeking to serve or connect to that deeply felt want/need in the most powerful way they can, these brands have been incredibly successful at inspiring the kind of brand love that powers amazing growth &mdash; the silver bullet &mdash; the kind of customer loyalty that can&rsquo;t be bought, but when carefully cultivated, pays huge dividends.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-08 15:40:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-08 15:40:39.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_ngt8kWI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/your-brands-silver-bullet/\", \"post_id\": \"4579\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-08 15:40:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-08 15:40:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"your-brands-silver-bullet\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4578\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2047\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAMkAAAAJGQ1YTllMTUxLTdjN2ItNDk2Ni1hYmUwLTRlNzA5ODg2ZmI2YQ.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"568\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436468400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

How Can I Focus On My Goal Rather Than On My Fear?</h3><p> <br/> Do not let your precious energy be wasted on fretting. One of the characteristics of willpower is the ability to focus, and once you focus all your energy on your goals, you are less likely to see failure as an acceptable alternative.</p><h3> 4. How Has Fear Prevented Me From Doing What Is Important To Me?</h3><p> <br/> If you are letting fear keep you from doing what you really want to do, it is paralyzing you. Break it down into small steps. Focus on progressing toward your goal a little more each day. Memorialize each step as a victory to help you keep moving ahead.</p><h3> 5. How Can I Acquire Information About What I Fear?</h3><p> <br/> Most of our fear is generated when we are faced with the unknown. One of the best ways of beating back this fear is to continually try new things so you become comfortable with moving into the unknown. Then we won&rsquo;t be as surprised or overwhelmed when something new or different presents itself.</p><p> Most successful people want to push themselves beyond past accomplishments. In order to do this, they push themselves outside their comfort zone. This means facing the fear of failure continually so they can predict their own responses when stressed and stretched.</p><p> This self-awareness provides valuable information about what they fear, the circumstances under which their fear rears it&rsquo;s ugly head, and how they can best move forward when faced with it.</p><h3> 6. How Can I Learn The Skills Necessary To Master My Fear?</h3><p> <br/> Whether you are in Special Forces, on a high school football team, or an FBI agent investigating a case, the answer is the same&mdash;train! Practice the skills you will need repeatedly until they become second nature.</p><p> When you&rsquo;ve trained how to respond to a crisis, you respond automatically to a checklist of skills that you&rsquo;ve already mastered. You do not become fearful; you become intense and focused.</p><h3> 7. How Can I Go It Alone?</h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t! Facing fear is easier when you&rsquo;re accompanied by other people whom you know and trust. Strong ties with other people are important. When we have supportive friends or colleagues by our side, we are more confident and better able to cope with problems.</p><h3> 8. How Can I Stop Feeling Fearful?</h3><p> <br/> Remember that your  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system\" target=\"_blank\">   limbic brain system  </a> </u>  is programmed to pay more attention to negative information that produces fearful responses. It&rsquo;s our survival instinct at work. And we tend to remember negative or traumatic information better than neutral or even positive experiences.</p><p> To counter this, you will need to hunt for the good stuff in every situation.  <u>  Find at least 5 positive responses to every 1 negative response </u> .</p><h3> 9. How Can I Retrain My Brain To Look At My Fear Differently?</h3><p> <br/> Every time your fearful memory is retrieved,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21068303\" target=\"_blank\">   it becomes unstable again for a brief period of time  </a> </u> . Just as my memory of the shotgun recoil was unstable, it opened a window during which the memory could be updated and changed.</p><p> It is possible to modify fearful memories when they are retrieved if you &ldquo;get back in the saddle&rdquo; and confront the very thing you are afraid of.</p><h3> 10. How Can I Modify A Fearful Memory?</h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3061554/\" target=\"_blank\">   Researchers  </a> </u>  agree that we must expose ourselves to our fear&mdash;but in a safe environment! The exposure also needs to last long enough for the brain to form a new memory. Your brain will recognize that the fear is no longer dangerous in your current environment.</p><p> <strong>  Look fear in the face. You will be amazed at how unscary it really is. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-08 15:31:43.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-08 15:31:43.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_iixrRB7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-questions-every-successful-person-needs-to-ask-about-fear/\", \"post_id\": \"4577\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-08 15:31:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-08 15:31:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-questions-every-successful-person-needs-to-ask-about-fear\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4576\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2046\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1435542417350-4d0a3c63afc4-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"733\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436445000,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

You really show great concern for my true animal nature. It&rsquo;s surprising to me that you can&rsquo;t get the document to open; I think we can cross off attention to detail as a reason. Before I &ldquo;resned&rdquo; it back to you, would you mind translating your dialect for me?</p><p> -----</p><h3> Why Your Torture Plan Will Surely Backfire</h3><p> <br/> While you might be thinking, &ldquo;oh they know what I mean&rdquo; what happens on the other end is another story. Poor grammar and misspellings are a big turn off and inspire deep-rooted judgment about your abilities. Yes, we are all busy and in a rush but for most of us, if you have the ability to write, you have the ability to read what you write before you hit send.</p><p> This particular form of judgment is rooted in the psychological phenomena called The Attribution Bias. When we make a mistake we attribute it to outside forces (weather, market forces, or a non-working spell check). When someone else makes a mistake or can&rsquo;t seem to proof read their documents, people around that person will attribute it to a character flaw. We reserve hardcore judgment for those that are not living in our own skin. So your continual resistance to proofreading your documents is earning you a reputation that you probably don&rsquo;t want.</p><p> -----</p><h3> Maybe Try This Instead?</h3><p> This is a really easy recommendation. Turn on your spelling and grammar check and do something when you see red or green squiggly lines. Get in the habit of proofreading before you hit send, even texts.

{"original_id":2013,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Most Advisors Don't Listen","link":"most-advisors-dont-listen","source_link":null,"content":"<p> According to a survey of women who invest, the biggest complaint against financial advisors is that they don&rsquo;t listen.</p><p> The dictionary defines listening as, &ldquo;to take notice of and act on what someone says.&rdquo;  The key words are &ldquo;act on.&rdquo;  While most advisors think they listen to their clients, the problem is often they aren&rsquo;t acting on what they hear. </p><p> It&rsquo;s not because women have shied away from expressing themselves. The women interviewed have been loud and clear about what they want, &ldquo;Connect investing to what&rsquo;s important in my life,&rdquo; they say.</p><p> One woman we interviewed said when she met with her advisor, she told him, &ldquo;My husband and I are preparing to retire. We want to discuss potentially buying a place in Italy and spending our winters there, going north of the city in the summer and maybe taking a trip every two years that would include the grandchildren.&rdquo; She specifically mentioned she didn&rsquo;t just want to hear about her investments and their rates of return.</p><p> But, she said, &ldquo;When we met a few weeks later he showed up with charts and tables, he talked about our investments, slight shifts in our asset allocation, and the returns on our portfolio. No discussion of goals, no discussion of foreign currencies, no discussion of the timing for retiring or selling our house.&rdquo;</p><h3> What happened?</h3><p> <br/> He failed to act on what he heard, because, like most financial advisors, he had a process for meetings that he was comfortable with. Unfortunately, it only included talking about finances.</p><p> It is worth noting that female financial advisors are often just as guilty when it comes to not listening and female clients show no gender preference when selecting an advisor. They are drawn to advisors who they believe understand them. Those who are the happiest with their advisors frequently state, &ldquo;He actually listens to me. I feel he knows and cares about me and acts in my best interest. &rdquo; </p><h3> How to listen</h3><li> There are no short cuts. You&rsquo;ll be able to better listen to clients by sitting beside them.</li><li> or just across from them, make eye contact and avoid physical barriers between you (i.e. do not sit behind a desk or table).</li><li> Make it in a place that is conducive to listening &ndash; at dinner or in their home, when you&rsquo;re not rushed.</li><li>  It is not enough to politely nod and look like you are listening when you are with a client.  You have to act on what they tell you.</li><li> You can only act on what they say by &ldquo;listening with heart&rdquo; to what is important to them. Encourage them to talk about their lives. Only then can you put their finances in terms that resonate with them.</li><li> Make mental or actual notes about what your client is saying and jot them down. What are her concerns, what are her dreams/plans for the future, what is her role in the family hierarchy, and how would she like to work with you?</li><li> Finally, show that you really listened by coming back with a plan that relates to her life. <br/>  </li><h3> Take away</h3><p> <br/> Listening is hard but anyone can learn the skill. Financial advisors who are good listeners are liked, appreciated and trusted. Listening helps you do a better job on behalf of your clients because you know more about them, what outcomes matter to them the most. It&rsquo;s also a competitive advantage: happy clients are not likely to leave you and will recommend you to others.</p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

{"original_id":2012,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Big Rules for Productive Conference Calls","link":"5-big-rules-for-productive-conference-calls","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s easy to fool ourselves into the illusion that &ldquo;just having a conference call,&rdquo; instead of a face-to-face meeting or one-on-one, will save time. In fact, it&rsquo;s that kind of thinking that leaves many managers moving from call to call with little time to connect with their team.</p><p> In an attempt to salvage some productivity in their day, they put the phone on mute and try to get real work done at the same time&mdash;and don&rsquo;t pay close attention to much as a result.</p><h3> A Quick Rant Against Conference Calls</h3><p> <strong>  Perhaps you&rsquo;ve been on one of these soul sucking calls. </strong> A direct report stops by, and, grateful for a distraction, you mouth &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s just our regular update call,&rdquo; put the phone on mute and attempt to a have a meaningful conversation.</p><p> Just when you&rsquo;re fist-bumping yourself for being a high-energy multi-tasker, you hear your name mentioned&hellip;twice. Oh crap. You quickly take the phone off mute, apologize and say, &ldquo;I was speaking to the mute button,&rdquo; which of course is technically true. The opinion you offer next is nowhere near as salient as it would have been if you had been paying attention. Your peer IMs you, &ldquo;What are you doing, aren&rsquo;t you going to bring up the idea we agreed to last week?&rdquo; Oh boy, now you&rsquo;ve ticked her off, and stumble awkwardly into, &ldquo;Oh, I forgot I do have one more thing to add. You see Janet and I were thinking&hellip;&rdquo; Awkward.</p><h3> Think Like an Entrepreneur</h3><p> One thing has been conspicuously missing this past year as I started my own business&ndash;no wasteful conference calls. Why? Well first, the last thing I want to charge my clients for is any time that will not add absolute value to them and their bottom line. Second, I don&rsquo;t want to pay my contractors for a minute of wasted effort that could be working productively to advance our mission of growing leaders around the world. The next time you have a conference call, try thinking like an entrepreneur. Estimate the hourly rate of those attending the call, and see if there&rsquo;s a more efficient use of their time to get to the result you need..</p><h3> Big Rules</h3><p> <strong>  Look them in the eye </strong></p><p> Honestly, one of the biggest reasons my &ldquo;conference calls&rdquo; have become so productive is that they&rsquo;re almost always done over video&ndash;for free.  <a href=\"https://www.zoom.us/?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Search%20%7C%20Zoom%20Branded&amp;utm_term=Zoom\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Zoom </a>  (my favorite), Skype, Go to Meeting, or Google Hangouts all work. You can see facial expressions and get a better read on emotions AND it takes multi-tasking off the table.</p><p> <strong>  Articulate outcomes </strong></p><p> Meetings are meant for two things, to move results forward or to build relationships. Be clear on your objectives. Are you there to make a specific decision? Are you working to gain buy-in to a change? Knowing why you have each item on the agenda will go a long way to keeping the call on track.</p><p> <strong>  Invite only necessary players </strong></p><p> When you&rsquo;re considering flying people in for a meeting,  you take a lot of thought to the time out of the field and the expense involved. Don&rsquo;t let &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a conference call&rdquo; suck you into a trap of over-inclusion. That kind of thinking compounds quickly.</p><p> <strong>  Segmentize discussion </strong></p><p> Use a narrowing agenda. Arrange the more general topics up front and then let people drop off as the topics become more specific. Explain what you&rsquo;re doing and why in advance, so you don&rsquo;t get people riled up about secret meetings. Be sure that it&rsquo;s not always the same people invited to drop first.</p><p> <strong>  End standing calls early and often </strong></p><p> I get nervous about weekly check-in calls, mostly because discussion expands to fill the time, when a briefer discussion could do. If a regularly scheduled call is important for your team or project, craft the agenda and estimate the time you think you will need. State that intention up front. &ldquo;If we keep to our agenda, I think today&rsquo;s call should only last about 37 minutes. Let&rsquo;s be as productive as possible so we can all have some time back.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Done well, conference calls can be an effective and efficient way to get the results you need. A little extra planning can save hours of lost time and productivity. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-07 19:00:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-07 19:00:34.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_TR0qDtb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-big-rules-for-productive-conference-calls/\", \"post_id\": \"4570\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-07 19:00:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-07 19:00:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-big-rules-for-productive-conference-calls\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4569\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2043\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-12.07.01-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"344\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436373900,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}

He and his single mother rented a small two-bedroom apartment on government assistance and relied on food stamps. Even though he didn&rsquo;t own a computer at the time, Koum devoured computer networking manuals and became proficient at hacking, a skill that helped him land a job at Yahoo! in 1997.</p><p> But after nine years at the Internet company, Koum grew restless. He had other ideas and ambitions. Within a year of leaving Yahoo!, he developed a new instant messaging app for smartphones that he named WhatsApp. Its popularity took off, and Koum watched the valuation of his startup soar from $250,000 in 2009 to $1.5 billion in July 2013.</p><p> The following year&mdash;only five years after its launch&mdash;WhatsApp was acquired by social media titan Facebook for $16 billion plus $3 billion for the company&rsquo;s founders. In a symbolic gesture, Koum signed the paperwork at the building that had once served as the welfare office where he received his food stamps. With the stroke of a pen, he became $6.8 billion richer. Today, WhatsApp is the top messaging app in the world, with 800 million monthly users, and Koum is number 208 on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans.</p><p> Koum&rsquo;s story might sound like a plotline from the mind of Horatio Alger, the nineteenth-century American novelist whose works dramatize the rise of an impoverished young man to financial prominence. But American history is replete with such stories, starting with that of Benjamin Franklin. One of the Founders of the United States, Franklin helped guarantee that this country would be a place where people can freely pursue their dreams, innovate and capitalize on their achievements.</p><p> Much has changed since Franklin signed the Declaration of Independence nearly 240 years ago, but America still stands as a land of opportunity for U.S.-born citizens and immigrants alike.</p><p> Where else but in America can a startup such as Uber be valued at $50 billion, higher than 80 percent of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index, only six years after its founding? Where else but in America can someone reach billionaire status by inventing a new type of hosiery, as Sara Blakely did with Spanx? Before her now-ubiquitous undergarments were worn by women&mdash;and now men&mdash;all over the globe, Blakely was so broke that she had to write her own patent without the help of an attorney.</p><p> As I pointed out in a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/these-self-made-billionaires-prove-piketty-wrong-about-wealth/#.VZVheP50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Frank Talk  </a> </u>  early last month, nearly 70 percent of billionaires who show up in the Forbes 400 list are self-made. In fact, the percentage of those who have a self-made score of 10, meaning they created their wealth from nothing (think Jan Koum, Oprah Winfrey and George Soros), now exceeds the percentage of those with a score of 1, indicating they inherited every cent (Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple-founder Steve Jobs). </p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-02/COMM-From-rags-to-riches-growth-of-self-made-billionaires-proves-the-american-dream-lives-on-07022015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" U.S. dollar Continues to Weigh on Copper\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-07-02/COMM-From-rags-to-riches-growth-of-self-made-billionaires-proves-the-american-dream-lives-on-07022015.gif\"/> </a> <br/> Regarding Apple, the tech giant represents just one of numerous American companies that were founded by either an immigrant or the child of an immigrant (Jobs&rsquo; biological father, still living, is Syrian). Recent examples include Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, who emigrated from the U.S.S.R.; Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors, originally from South Africa; and Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang, a Taiwanese &eacute;migr&eacute;.

Amazingly, more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were at least co-founded by immigrants or their children: AT&amp;T, Budweiser, General Electric and IBM, among many more.</p><p> It&rsquo;s doubtful that Jan Koum would have found the same level of success had he and his mother stayed in Ukraine.

Dwelling in the past and harboring thoughts of &ldquo;woulda, coulda, shoulda&rdquo; can lead to depression. The fact remains: No one can say how life might have turned out under different circumstances. Assuming things would be better&mdash;and worrying about it&mdash;is just unproductive speculation.</p><h3> Past and Future</h3><p> <br/> Decisions you made yesterday or events that occurred last month or 10 years ago did not happen within a vacuum. They set off other events within your environment and affected others around you. It is really impossible to say for certain that if only you had done this or if only this had happened, your life would be better today. Dwelling on the future, on the other hand, can lead to anxiety; the future is unknown and fear of the unknown is a common trigger for stress. For that reason, much stress and anxiety result from our projections about how events of today will play out tomorrow. All those automatic tendencies of our brain tend to take us to imaginary places in order to protect us from the sometimes painful and dangerous realities of today. The truth is, if we do not cave in to those thoughts we end up better prepared to deal with the realities.</p><h3> Past Nightmare</h3><p> <br/> Lorraine is a 62-year-old real estate agent who described the past two years as &ldquo;a nightmare.&rdquo; She and her husband had developed financial problems due to a failed business venture. In addition, their daughter had financial problems of her own, requiring their help. On top of all that, one of their grandchildren developed a serious illness. At the time, Lorraine experienced recurring anxiety, fear and depression. Lorraine&rsquo;s depression stemmed from her thoughts about her life before her misfortune, along with a lot of woulda, coulda, shouldas. Her anxiety arose from fearful thoughts. But, despite this, everything turned out fine. When Lorraine and her husband resolved a crucial financial problem, his back pain disappeared almost overnight&mdash;a pain that had plagued him for at least two years.                                                                                             </p><p> Look back to the past for only one reason&mdash;to identify those times in the past when you felt stressed or afraid. Now fast-forward to today. If you knew then how you would feel about those things today or how they ultimately turned out, would you have been so afraid back then?</p><h3> How to Stay Calm and Productive</h3><p> <br/> When faced with challenges, our instinct is to trust the automatic thoughts of a protective, primitive reflex, which tries to direct us to fight or flee danger, real or imagined. We start to believe that looking back will give us a reference point to understand the present danger, and that looking forward will prepare us for the multiple permutations of upcoming events.</p><p> The key is not to make decisions today based on those automatic thoughts. Below are some suggestions to help calm the whirlwind of thoughts that lead to feeling overwhelmed and out of control.</p><li> <strong>  Control your breathing. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Resist looking to the past for answers </strong> if those thoughts lead to negative feelings Be aware that your decision not to dwell there could trigger a danger memory&mdash;one that equates not thinking about the past with you being a bad person. But don&rsquo;t believe it!</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t listen to or watch the news. </strong> Listening to the incessant flow of travail in the world serves only to fuel your fears and make you less prepared to make sensible decisions.</li><li> <strong>  Ask yourself every morning, </strong> &ldquo;What am I going to do today to make myself happy, healthy, and prosperous?&rdquo; Then, answer with, &ldquo;I will always find a way and a way will always find me.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Be mindful that the primitive part of your nature will warn you that these steps are not what you need to do right now; however, they are precisely what you need to do right now!</p><p> As you dwell less in the past and project less into the future, you will start to see that the answers you seek for your current problems are already here with you, in the present, right now.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-07 18:35:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-07 18:35:33.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_Jl9mAIE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/bust-stress-right-now/\", \"post_id\": \"4566\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-07 18:35:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-07 18:35:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"bust-stress-right-now\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4565\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2041\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/photo-1435914149323-1b656e7ab379-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"763\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436378400,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2009,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Share Important Documents After a Divorce","link":"how-to-share-important-documents-after-a-divorce","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/estateassistus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Estate Assist  </a> </u></p><p> When it comes to divorces, it is best if both partners let civility reign. Confrontational attitudes and malice never result in a good ending, so avoid it at all costs. Most couples know that assets and liabilities must be split, but seldom consider the implications of failing to share important personal and financial documents, and they struggle to decide which ones to keep private. Document sharing is even more important if there are kids in common. Couples who are considering a divorce can benefit greatly from putting a plan together that enables them to easily share documents and information without having to meet face-to-face each time one or the other needs access to information. Not only do couples need to learn how to share documents, but they also need to know which documents must be shared and for how long, and often need to take into account the privacy and sensibilities of their new spouse. If you are divorcing or have divorced recently, then take note of the following tips, and get your affairs in order. Having the right documents accessible to you and your ex-spouse can make life a thousand times easier and reduce the possibility of being stressed due to having to confront each other every time a need arises.</p><p> <strong>  Share Tax-Related Documents </strong> <br/> When you divorce, you will need to engage in financial transactions that will demand proof of income for prior years. In many cases, you will also be required to prove that you qualified for certain tax credits in order to have access to specific programs. Both you and your ex-spouse can benefit greatly from having access to the last five years of tax documentation. This includes your actual tax return and copies of any supporting documents associated with the return.</p><p> <u>  Want to learn more about storing tax documents? Let us show you how </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Share Documents That Demonstrate Assigned Liabilities </strong> <br/> Your divorce decree will include terms of financial responsibility for certain liabilities. When liabilities are assigned, it is the responsibility of both parties to contact the lender and provide them a copy of the terms. In some instances, if a spouse acted as a co-signer, then there is no way out of the financial responsibility. If the liable spouse does not take a separate loan to pay the monies in full, then you are on the hook. Keep track of the payments and, if need be, step up and make a payment to avoid latency. As long as you are a co-signer, your credit will be affected by how the debt is paid.</p><p> <strong>  Share Divorce Papers </strong> <br/> Both of you will need every document associated with the divorce proceedings. Make certain both parties have access to hard copies of the divorce decree as well as supporting documents, and upload a digital copy for reference.</p><p> <strong>  Share Financial Documents to Prove Solvency </strong> <br/> When you begin building your credit as a single person, you will be asked to provide evidence of prior financial dealings and sources of income. Make certain both parties have access to documents that prove financial solvency.</p><p> <strong>  Share Health Records for Your Children </strong> <br/> Emotionally healthy joint parenting is all about the ability to maintain open and functional communication. If you and your ex are raising little ones together, then make a concerted effort to have shared access to their health records, medical history, and vaccinations. Having this information handy can be life saving in the event of an emergency, and it always makes visits to the doctor, school, and activity enrollment easier for everyone. Keep in mind that health records must be updated frequently and reflect the most recent changes to the health of your child. Work as a team to make certain both of you are aware of any changes to your child&rsquo;s health, and any medications he or she may be taking.</p><p> <strong>  Share Guardianship Documents </strong> <br/> Make it a point to have the most updated versions of guardianship documents and any terms associated with custody. Also, discuss how you plan to take care of the kids in case of an emergency, such as a parent becoming incapacitated. Having a documented plan B is a healthy approach to joint parenting, and it is helpful in reducing the stress and anxiety often experienced by children of divorced households.</p><p> Now that we have tackled some of the documents and information you might need to share with your ex spouse, in hard-copy version as well as digital files, let&rsquo;s talk about the items that need to be separated. Above all things, be swift in clearly separating your financial affairs, including removing your ex from bank accounts that once had a joint status. Additionally, each should keep the original and copies of documents that prove ownership, such as deeds and titles for the property that the divorce decree lists as individual ownership. While you are at it, be amicable and split photos and heirlooms in a way that allows both you and your ex to keep the memories that matter the most to each of you.</p><p> The initial steps of sharing important documents include making hard copies for you and your ex. Once each of you has paper files, it would be wise for both to keep the documents safely stored in the cloud. If your divorce is on friendly terms, then you can both share a  <u>  digital safe deposit box </u> , allowing for easy access to each document for reference, or when needing to print a hard copy. By having a shared environment for document storage that both of you might need, you reduce friction and set the stage for a more cooperative and healthy long-term relationship. This is especially important if you have kids in common and have decided to work together toward providing an emotionally healthy family dynamic for your little ones.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-07-07 18:31:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-07-07 18:31:40.000000","image_url":"2015/7/article_placeholder_sZct70u.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-share-important-documents-after-a-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"4564\", \"post_date\": \"2015-07-07 18:31:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-07-07 18:31:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-share-important-documents-after-a-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"4563\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2040\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/divorcepapers_blog2.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"682\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/3-advisor-teams-with-winning-social-strategies/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"51\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1436355900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2008,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Financial Advisors Can Effectively Deal With Difficult People","link":"how-financial-advisors-can-effectively-deal-with-difficult-people","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you work in the financial advisory business, chances are you have to deal with difficult employees, partners or even prospects and clients.</p><p> The fact of the matter is that difficult people are everywhere; and dealing with them is excruciating, time consuming and costly. But rather than avoiding or firing difficult employees, it is critical to find ways to work with them to change the difficult interaction into a productive interaction for both parties and clients and prospects can exhibit bad behavior and you might need ways to deal with it. Here is a guideline for financial advisors to effectively and efficiently deal with difficult people:</p><h3> Define Difficult</h3><p> <br/> Everyone has a different definition of &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;. Take some time to recognize what a person does that you don&rsquo;t like. Some advisors find loud clients difficult to do business with, whereas a few of them consider individuals who are &ldquo;too helpful&rdquo; annoying. The list can go on, but take time to document it.</p><h3> Analyze Behavior</h3><p> <br/> Why do you find someone&rsquo;s behavior difficult? Discover what negative emotions their behavior triggers within you. Get your whole advisory team together to go through this exercise. Different things trigger different people. Thus, there is really no universal definition of &ldquo;difficult.&rdquo; It is usually our experience of someone that makes them difficult to us. Having said that, that does not mean that your advisory firm doesn&rsquo;t have a client that no one likes to deal with.</p><h3> Question Filter</h3><p> <br/> After identifying the reason that sets you off, you may question your own filter on the person. Ask yourself: Why does this person&rsquo;s behavior bother me? Is it really the person&rsquo;s behavior, or something that I or my staff need to take into consideration?</p><h3> Differences in Behavioral Style</h3><p> <br/> Often, difficulties arise due to differences in behavioral style. For instance, some people have a brusque communication approach, while others are more friendly and polite. Usually, people tend to see differences in style as &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; and not &ldquo;different&rdquo;. We get annoyed when the other person is not like us.</p><p> In financial advisory firms, it&rsquo;s not atypical that a client gets along great with the portfolio manager. Their styles may &ldquo;click&rdquo; well, but if staff members do not have similar communication approaches, the client may turn someone else off (and vice versa).</p><p> When we connect well with someone else, we wrongly assume everyone does. This can be a fatal mistake, especially in a small firm.</p><h3> Observe Style</h3><p> <br/> In order to get through to someone, observe and match their body language, tone and words, whenever you can.
