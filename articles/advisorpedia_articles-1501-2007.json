    "content": "<p> As an entrepreneur, it&rsquo;s up to you to bring in the money in your business. And as you know, it&rsquo;s up to you to manage the money to help the business grow.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no different outside of your work with your personal finances. If your own finances are in order, you&rsquo;ll protect your family, reduce stress, and free up time to help you focus on your business. Take these steps to better manage your money at home.</p><h3> 1. Separate Your Business and Personal Finances</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re a new entrepreneur, you might have fallen into the trap of not separating your personal and business accounts. It feels more convenient now, but it makes keeping track of both difficult. Keeping separate checking, savings, and credit card accounts  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/end-of-year-tax-considerations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   makes tax time easier  </a> </u> , too.</p><p> And in some cases separating your assets reduces your liability risk of losing everything if something negative were to happen down the road.</p><h3> 2. Track Your Income, Expenses, and Cash Flow</h3><p> <br/> You need to be crystal clear about whether or not your business is making or losing money. Once again, it&rsquo;s just the same in your personal finances. You can get that clarity by  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/7-money-moves-financially-savvy-couples/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tracking your income, expenses, and cash flow  </a> </u> . If your expenses are regularly exceeding your salary from the business, you need to know so you can make changes sooner rather than later.</p><p> As an entrepreneur, you probably have a variable income. That&rsquo;s why you have to take it one step further and plan your cash flow. Cash flow can be tight when a large expense and a lower income month hit at the same time. It&rsquo;s not just how much you make and spend; it&rsquo;s also about when the income and expenses hit.</p><p> Take a look at the whole picture so you can see if you need to save in advance for a big purchase. Paying attention to both your income and cash flow will make it easier to meet your monthly obligations and still have some left for fun, too.</p><h3> 3. Create a Budget That Works on a Variable Income</h3><p> <br/> Managing cash flow  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-budget-and-manage-your-finances-on-a-variable-income/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   on a variable income  </a> </u>  is not a simple task. A budget helps make it easier.</p><p> Separate your expenses into necessary expenses, discretionary expenses, short term savings, and long term savings. You now have a monthly income target. If you ever have a lower income month, you&rsquo;ll know exactly what you need to pay the bills. Then you can allocate the rest according to your priorities.</p><h3> 4. Build Up Your Emergency Fund</h3><p> <br/> As an entrepreneur, you will probably have some months where you make less money that you&rsquo;d like.  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/stop-living-paycheck-to-paycheck/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Your emergency fund  </a> </u>  is your first defense against an income that changes from month to month with slow or busy periods.</p><p> The general rule of thumb is that you keep at least 3 to 6 months of expenses saved. Since your income is more volatile, you deal with more risk &mdash; and that means creating a bigger fund. Aim to save 6 to 12 months&rsquo; worth of expenses to protect yourself against the unexpected.</p><h3> 5. Take Advantage of Retirement Accounts</h3><p> <br/> Even though you&rsquo;re not an employee and can&rsquo;t use a 401(k), you need to save for your future. In fact, that makes it all the more critical for you to do so &mdash; it&rsquo;s up to you to put aside some for the day you can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to work anymore.</p><p> Make the most of your hard-earned income by tucking away your savings into  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/retirement-plans-for-entrepreneurs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tax-advantaged retirement accounts  </a> </u> . You can start by putting away some income into a Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or a traditional IRA. If you&rsquo;re self-employed, you can also contribute to a Solo 401(k). If your business has just a few employees, or you are self-employed, you can also choose to contribute to a Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP).</p><h3> 6. Protect Your Income with Proper Insurance</h3><p> <br/> As a business owner, there&rsquo;s a lot at risk. If you were to pass away, become disabled, or even make a honest professional mistake, both your business and your personal assets could be at risk. Protect your income by making sure you  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/property-and-casualty-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   have the right insurance  </a> </u> .</p><p> At a personal level, consider homeowner&rsquo;s insurance, auto insurance,  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/disability-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   disability insurance  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/yolo-so-dont-ignore-your-need-for-life-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   life insurance  </a> </u> , and umbrella insurance. The exact specifications about what you need will depend on your personal situation. Consult with an experienced financial advisor to make sure you have what you need to protect your future at a reasonable cost.</p><h3> 7. Automate Your Finances</h3><p> <br/> When running a business, there&rsquo;s always something that needs your time and attention. There&rsquo;s no need to spend your precious energy doing work that can be eliminated altogether.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/4-bad-money-habits-that-could-be-ruining-your-finances/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Automate your finances  </a> </u>  so the whole system runs without you. Set up your paycheck to be sent to your bank account automatically. Set up your regular bills on auto-pay. If the company doesn&rsquo;t have an auto-pay option, look into sending a check from your bank. Make your investments automatically, and you&rsquo;ll dollar cost average into the market as well.</p><h3> 8. Hire Professionals</h3><p> <br/> As an entrepreneur, you wear a lot of hats to keep everything running. But you probably get paid by adding value to clients by doing something really, really well. Let financial professionals help you in the way you help your clients.</p><p> Build a money team for yourself, consisting of an accountant, financial advisor, bookkeeper, and attorney to make sure you are covered in every aspect of your business. You&rsquo;ll protect yourself from trouble and save money in the long run.</p><h3> 9. Outsource to Free Up Time and Energy</h3><p> <br/> As your business grows, you will be often be stretched for time and energy. When you are, take a look at your workload and see if it makes sense to outsource.</p><p> Consider both your home and business responsibilities. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to hire someone to clean your home, or perhaps it&rsquo;s time to bring on an assistant in the business.</p><p> Hiring another person does cost money. But it enables you to focus on higher level tasks to help you earn more and scale your business.</p><h3> 10. Reinvest in Yourself</h3><p> <br/> Your business will always need money, time, and attention to grow. But you are the driving force behind the business. That&rsquo;s why you must  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/human-capital-investing-in-your-income/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reinvest in yourself  </a> </u> .</p><p> Go take a course or attend a conference. Set aside some savings so your future self can take advantage of big opportunities. You&rsquo;ll grow as a person, and your business will grow, too.</p><h3> The Next Step</h3><p> <br/> Take the time to bring your personal finances to a better place. By managing your money well, you&rsquo;ll reduce your financial worries so you can focus on taking yourself &ndash; and your business &ndash; to next level.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Nancy was hired into an entry-level position in Human Resources immediately after college graduation. Her advantage with her new employer was that she was previously an intern with the company. Nancy showed work ethic, curiosity, a willingness to learn, and a willingness to do whatever was needed to complete a job.</p><p> For two years Nancy had shown similar behaviors while serving as an intern. During the past year, her actions observed were not consistent. She began voicing disapproval when requested to complete activities she did not want to do. In addition, she would show what was perceived to be &ldquo;contempt&rdquo; for individuals on the management team. For example, an Executive Vice President requested Nancy to post a position and then create a recruiting plan for that respective position. All of this activity was well within Nancy&rsquo;s job description and more importantly well within her skill level and proven ability. For some reason, Nancy&rsquo;s response was more in the realm of defiance to the EVP by asking, &ldquo;Why are we hiring for this position? Don&rsquo;t we have plenty of people currently that can do that job? This position is not needed until next year; why are you having me do all this work now? We&rsquo;ll find candidates and then put them off until next year? This doesn&rsquo;t make any sense!&rdquo;</p><p> The EVP went to Nancy&rsquo;s boss and shared the story above. Her boss thanked the EVP. In addition Nancy&rsquo;s boss replied with, &ldquo;Oh, Nancy is still young. She&rsquo;s just in one of her moods. You know how that generation is these days. I know Nancy has been moody lately. I&rsquo;ll look into the circumstances, thank you again.&rdquo;</p><p> Nancy&rsquo;s boss pondered this current incident. Her boss started thinking that this was not the first time for this outburst and she began to wonder why Nancy is acting out. Could it be:</p><li> Nancy is looking for a new job?</li><li> Something in her personal life? (i.e. Breakup with her boyfriend?)</li><li> The EVP said something in a way that was interpreted by Nancy to be disrespectful?</li><li> Nancy is bored in her current role and needs to be given more responsibility? <br/>  </li><p> During their next scheduled one-on-one, Nancy&rsquo;s boss shared with her the story the EVP presented. Her boss asked what happened and why she replied to the EVP as she did.</p><p> Their history of open and honest conversations in the past supported Nancy to share her thoughts. Nancy presented the following as to why she reacted the way she did and why she was upset.</p><p> Her boss, being a thoughtful, insightful, and soulful leader, responded with courage to each discussion-point:</p><p> <strong>  1. Nancy: </strong>  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why I have to do all this extra work when I know I have three months to fill the position. And, this EVP won&rsquo;t do his share to follow our hiring process. I will have to do all this extra work just because.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Boss: </strong>  &ldquo;What the EVP requested is not out of line. They are anticipating their needs for the next year. Instead of being upset about the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; work, next time ask &ldquo;why&rdquo; the EVP wants to start searching so far in advance. Seek to understand and get clarity before judging.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  2. Nancy: </strong>  &ldquo;After two years I thought I would be closer to a promotion to the next level. And now we&rsquo;re preparing for our annual review process and it got me thinking how hard I work compared to individuals in other departments yet I don&rsquo;t get paid as much as they do.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Boss: </strong>  &ldquo;You chose this career path. You were provided the reality of the career path along with potential compensation levels commensurate with levels of promotion. If you want to be compensated as people in other departments, you have a choice to move into another department. I will support you and ensure you are seriously considered.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  3. Nancy: </strong>  &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I get included in on the really important decision making discussions? How else will I learn about the different areas of the business and be able to participate in decision making in the near future?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Boss: </strong>  &ldquo;I include you in on all decision-making done in this department. Ultimately, I have final say for this department; ultimately, the CEO has final say for the company. If you feel this is not enough, I understand. I will do my best to include you in more decision making as it relates to our specific area.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  4. Nancy: </strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked you to give me more responsibility and more opportunities to grow and all you do is give me more work from your piles.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Boss: </strong>  &ldquo;I have given you projects to complete for the past two years. Your work has been excellent. What you haven&rsquo;t done is taken on the respective areas as your responsibility. You continue to give me the completed work and then ask for more. For example, for the past two years I have given you the annual enrollment process to prepare for insurance selection. This year, I asked you to speak with our current broker and work with them to understand the pricing. I then asked you to call other brokers, names provided, to compare pricing. Your response was, &lsquo;why speak with other brokers when we have this one.'&rdquo;</p><p> This was an opportunity for you to take ownership for the insurance area of the company. This was a teaching/learning exercise for you to become the in-house expert, someone I would go to in the future. Instead, you turned it into a &ldquo;why me?&rdquo; conversation rather than view it as a growth opportunity. You are as culpable as the firm in your development and professional growth.&rdquo;</p><p> While Nancy&rsquo;s boss was frustrated while listening to Nancy&rsquo;s &ldquo;complaints,&rdquo; she saw an opportunity to help her direct report learn and grow. She could have simply reprimanded Nancy for her immaturity and shortsightedness in the situation. However, great leaders always have the opportunity to manage and teach based on the respective individual and the corresponding circumstances.</p><p> The choice is yours!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Chad Van Horn | <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VHLawGroup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Van Horn Law Group  </a> </u></p><p> The beautiful, the strong, and the successful: These three adjectives are commonly used to describe star athletes nationwide, whose appearances fatten their bank accounts with millions of dollars multiple times per year. Whether it's talent or a lifetime of training, famous athletes rapidly become household names for their prowess and riches. However, the heights of wealth are a precarious place to be in - and falling down hurts.</p><h3> Fiction and Reality</h3><p> <br/> The latest hit series from HBO, Ballers, shows a seemingly whimsical story: a former star footballer turned financial adviser picks new clients &ndash; his colleagues from the field, busy hemorrhaging money to hangers-on, luxurious lifestyle, and plenty of poor financial decisions. As whimsical and hilarious as it may appear, it is the unfortunate reality for a great many sportsmen.</p><p> Just how many? Across the three largest sports leagues in the United States &ndash; NBA, NFL, and Major League Baseball &ndash; you can expect that within two years of retirement,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.si.com/vault/2009/03/23/105789480/how-and-why-athletes-go-broke\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   roughly four in five players will wind up in major financial trouble or outright bankruptcy  </a> </u> . After five years from retirement, three out of five will have burned through the money they earned during their career.</p><p> Of course, when star athletes lose millions it's not limited to just basketball, baseball, or football. It happens regardless of sport discipline, with one of the most high profile examples of financial failure being the Iron Mike. Though he earned close to $400 million over the course of his career, he wound up declaring bankruptcy in 2003. As it turns out,  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/05/sports/tyson-s-bankruptcy-is-a-lesson-in-ways-to-squander-a-fortune.html\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Siberian tigers, six figure jewelry, and mansions in Vegas are not a sound investment strategy  </u>  . </a></p><h3> Mismanagement and You</h3><p> <br/> There are a variety of factors that contribute to such a high incidence of financial failure among the high earners. Key among them is misguided confidence &ndash; excellence in sports does not automatically mean excellence in management, finances, or judging character. Athletes tend to trust the wrong people with their money with disturbing regularity. The result?  <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6895017/nfl-michael-vick-typifies-how-easily-nfl-players-go-bankrupt-espn-magazine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Disreputable financial managers cost 78 NFL players over $42 million dollars between 1999 and 2003 alone  </u>  .  </a></p><p> That being said, it's not difficult to understand why they chose to trust people who make great promises, but ultimately fail to deliver. Finances are complicated and formulating a sound strategy for long term survival requires a lot of thought and familiarizing yourself with a lot of arcane-sounding terms and mechanisms. Faced with this prospect many choose to sidestep the issue altogether and pass responsibility along.</p><p> Though the extreme numbers might make these problems look like they only apply to the rich and famous, they are a very real concern for you and your finances, regardless of how many figures you need to write down your annual income. Treat the stories of bankrupt stars as advice. Consider how much money you really need to spend to get what you need and make the most of it. Don't overestimate your ability to understand finances and ask professionals for advice.</p><p> And when you do ask for advice, never trust someone based purely on instinct, family ties, or friends' recommendations. Devote time to explore your options and pick someone who's truly the best &ndash; rather than simply claiming to one.</p>",

    "content": "<p> You are sitting on a dock in a comfy Adirondack chair on a hot day, with a glass of lemonade filled to the brim with ice cubes. You decide to pick up a good book. You can&rsquo;t get into a new mystery novel for some reason so you turn to your business books. You are a student of the industry, a life long learner, and you have a library of good books.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/108897242618977470844/posts?rel=author\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Andrew Lisa  </u> </a></p><p> If only time were as plentiful as distractions. Creating a productive workplace starts with yourself. Begin by improving your own efficiency, and then try to pass it on to your employees. Here are some productivity boosters that you may not have tried yet.</p><h3> The 27-3 Rule</h3><p> <br/> Work in smaller increments broken up by micro breaks. Take a three-minute break every half hour. Get up, walk around, clear your mind, glance at your phone and then get back to work. 27 minutes of work followed by a short, three-minute breather enables you to work with intensity and focus before resetting again. You'll lose 12 minutes every two hours &ndash; but those minutes aren't really lost if they make the lion's share of your workday more productive and more focused. It doesn't have to be 27 minutes on, three minutes off &ndash; experiment and choose a formula that works for you.</p><h3> Disable Push Notifications</h3><p> <br/> Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and your email are always just one phone-glance away. It takes a strong mind to resist the urge to check your phone for new updates, likes, retweets and messages when you should be working. But when it's beeping, pinging and chirping, even those of us with the mightiest willpower will crack. Once you take a peek at your phone, even if only for a second, it will take time to get refocused and truly get back to work.</p><h3> Prioritize More Efficiently</h3><p> <br/> As discussed in the article \"6 Ways to Boost Workplace Productivity That You Haven't Thought of Yet,\" there is a difference between urgent and important. When structuring your workflow, be honest with yourself about which tasks you absolutely dread &ndash; and are therefore more likely to put off.</p><p> Consider staggering easier tasks next to harder ones. Start the day with something simple and painless to get in a rhythm, and then immediately follow up with the hardest task of the day. This way, you'll build up some steam just before doing the heavy lifting.</p><h3> Allow Flexibility in Scheduling</h3><p> <br/> Finally, an efficient workplace is one that is populated with employees who are working at their most productive time of day. Not everyone is a morning person, for example. Employees who are upset because they are missing their kid's soccer game or are stressed because they're not sure if they'll make it to their doctor's appointment after work are not focused on the task at hand.</p><p> Whenever possible, allow employees to come in when it works for them. Flextime &ndash; as flexible scheduling is often called &ndash; is one of the most coveted perks that an employer can offer. Flextime makes happy, loyal employees.</p><h3> Employees with flexible schedules are happy and productive.</h3><p> <br/> In order to create a productive workplace, you'll have to start by improving your own efficiency. Break up blocks of time with micro breaks, prioritize your workflow and find ways to ignore your productivity-sapping phone. Then, once you've set the example, give your employees the flexibly in scheduling needed to perform at their peak.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The future of marketing success lies in love, not loyalty, emotion not engagement and in share of heart not share of wallet. The greatest connection your brand can have with your customers is one of love. American brands are bottom of the list when it comes to being an irreplaceable part of their customer&rsquo;s lives. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.meaningful-brands.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Havas Media 2015 global index  </a> </u>  of brand meaningfulness, only 5% of American brands would be missed if they disappeared tomorrow, compared with 60% of Asian brands.</p><p> Increased competition among brands, the commoditization of products and services and lack of connection with consumers all contribute to this disparity. From our point of view, &ldquo;lack of connection&rdquo; with consumers is the single biggest opportunity for brands to find and maintain valuable Heartspace.</p><h3> We can define Heartspace as a deeper connection we have created and enjoy with our customers.</h3><p> <br/> There is emotion far beyond the transaction and a passion more normally reserved for our relationships. It allows for forgiveness when we make mistakes, means we are preferred over cheaper or even more convenient options and customers who are advocates and vociferous defenders of the brand and its products.</p><p> Brands that successfully create Heartspace stand for something and against something else. They have a point of view and a set of values that supports this view. Their purpose is always greater than their products or services and it&rsquo;s easy for customers to evaluate whether this is a company that aligns with their own purpose and values.</p><p> Apple creates Heartspace by providing more and more avenues for self expression, Southwest creates Heartspace by putting the love into travel, Jeni&rsquo;s Ice Creams creates Heartspace with their transparency and purpose and their customers  <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2015/05/08/jenixs-fans-post-love-note-on-shop-doors.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  write them love notes </a>  to show how much they care. Each of these brands is more profitable because of the place they hold in the hearts of their customers. Should these brands disappear tomorrow, a large heart shaped hole would exist in the lives of their customers.</p><h3> The goal is not for everyone to love you.</h3><p> <br/> The goal is for you to find customers that align with your values and love you because of them. You&rsquo;ve got a point of view and they share it. You live it through every interaction and action, you use your values to guide you, not the next big revenue opportunity.</p><p> Do you create Heartspace? Do you lead with love or strive for sales? Are you dispensable or demanded? Win the heart and you win the mind, the wallet will follow.</p>",

Paying back the loans is also very difficult when borrowers don&rsquo;t graduate and earn less in their jobs. Add stress to the host of issues that accompany borrowing for college.</p><p> Students who have debt or expect to be in debt after college &ndash; whether college loans, credit cards, or car loans &ndash; are &ldquo;significantly more likely to report financial stress&rdquo; than students who did not have any debt, the study reported.</p><p> This finding was based on a survey of nearly 4,500 Ohio college students who answered 100 questions in the Ohio Student Financial Wellness Survey in late 2010. The study controlled for a range of factors, including race, grade point average, sex and the type of institution attended &ndash; public or private.</p><h3> Debt combines with coming-of-age issues, such as peer pressure, to heighten college borrowers&rsquo; stress levels.</h3><p> <br/> For example, one of the largest sources of stress was not being able to afford to participate in activities with their peers, the researchers found. Spending more than one can afford and borrowing to fill the holes also contributed to stress levels.</p><p> Stress can lead to depression, anxiety, lower academic performance, and difficulty completing a degree. Student debt is a heavy load to carry.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Would you like to build up a million-dollar nest egg by the time you retire? For middle-class earners, that goal is challenging but possible if you start at age 25 and save $1750 a month. Many married couples could do this by maxing out their 401(k) contributions. Or you could take the route that many people follow and build a small business into a million-dollar asset.</p><p> What if you want to accumulate a billion-dollar nest egg instead? Starting at the same age of 25, you would need to save $21 million a year. Good luck with getting any employer match on that.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a vast difference between a million and a billion. It&rsquo;s completely misleading when activists, politicians, and the media refer glibly to &ldquo;millionaires and billionaires&rdquo; as if the two are almost interchangeable. Someone with a net worth of one million dollars isn&rsquo;t even close to being in the same category as someone worth one billion.</p><p> Here are a few more  <u>  <a href=\"http://statistics.about.com/od/Applications/a/Millions-Billions-And-Trillions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   examples  </a> </u>  to clarify the difference:</p><li> One million seconds from now is about 11 and a half days away. One billion seconds from now is about 31 and a half years in the future.</li><li> A million hours ago was 114 years in the past, early in the 20th century; our ancestors were using electricity and telephones. A billion hours ago was over 114,155 years in the past; our ancestors had evolved into Homo sapiens but were still using primitive stone tools.</li><li> Put one million ants on one side of a scale and a female Asian elephant on the other side. The million ants, at around six pounds, would hardly register against the elephant&rsquo;s three tons. Put a billion ants on the scale, however, and they would balance or even outweigh the elephant.</li><li> One million pennies stacked on top of each other would make a tower nearly a mile high. One billion pennies stacked on top of each other would make a tower almost 870 miles high.</li><li> If you earned $45,000 a year and stashed it all under your mattress, you&rsquo;d have one million dollars at the end of 22 years. To accumulate one billion dollars at that same rate, you&rsquo;d need the help of your many-times-great grandchildren, because it would take 22,000 years. <br/>  </li><p> In today&rsquo;s world, being a millionaire represents financial security, not vast  <u>  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/weekly-column/how-rich-is-rich\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wealth  </a> </u> . At a withdrawal rate of 3%&mdash;the amount most experts consider sustainable&mdash;an investment portfolio of one million dollars will provide an income of $30,000 a year. Combined with Social Security, that would be enough to live comfortably but not lavishly in retirement.</p><h3> Three percent of one billion dollars, on the other hand, will furnish an income of $30 million a year; definitely private jet and gated estate territory.</h3><p> <br/> If millions and billions aren&rsquo;t challenging enough, here&rsquo;s a quick look at trillions. One trillion is a million millions, or a thousand billions. It would take one thousand elephants to balance the weight of one trillion ants. Astronomers estimate the number of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.space.com/25959-how-many-stars-are-in-the-milky-way.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   stars in our Milky Way galaxy  </a> </u>  between 100 billion and 400 billion; not even close to a trillion. No wonder it&rsquo;s so hard for most of us to wrap our minds around information like, &ldquo;The current  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.concordcoalition.org/us-total-national-debt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   US national debt  </a> </u>  is more than 16.7 trillion dollars.&rdquo;</p><p> Becoming a millionaire? It&rsquo;s not only achievable, but wise if you want financial security in old age. Becoming a billionaire? You&rsquo;d better plan to invent something amazing, write several dozen international best-sellers, or build an incredibly successful business. Becoming a trillionaire? Don&rsquo;t waste your time thinking about it. For good reason, the word isn&rsquo;t even in the dictionary.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/how-much-is-a-trillion.jpg\"/></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Great business cases contain objective, compelling and effective information </strong> that allows senior managers to choose the projects with the best financial returns for their organizations.</p><p> Say you want to implement an enterprise content management (ECM) system. Your business case for purchasing the system could be that it would improve customer satisfaction, reduce onsite and offsite storage costs and require less time to complete routine tasks.</p><p> But depending on your organization, the steps to build that business case could be highly structured or relatively brief. Here are a few key points to consider as you build your business case.</p><h3> Build your team</h3><p> <br/> Building a cross-functional team allows you to examine solutions from multiple angles. Otherwise, you run the risk of developing a solution from one particular point of view&mdash;most likely your department&rsquo;s&mdash;and overlooking a better solution or important costs and benefits.</p><p> Keep your group small&mdash;no more than six people if possible&mdash;so you can efficiently work out the best solution. Include the following types of team members:</p><li> <strong>  A financial representative.  </strong> Someone from Finance can help establish current costs and benefits, and make accurate projections.</li><li> <strong>  Beneficiaries. </strong>  Beneficiaries feel the pain you&rsquo;re trying to solve, so addressing their concerns is important. Just remember that they might not always be objective!</li><li> <strong>  Someone who works with customers. </strong>  If customers feel the pain the most, or if the proposed solution will affect them, include someone who knows what they care about.</li><li> <strong>  Experts from your network. </strong>  If you can&rsquo;t get all the information you need from the people you work with, reach out to your network of connections, vendors and partners. <br/>  </li><h3> Identify the best solution</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes you&rsquo;re identifying a solution to a problem that your boss has handed to you. Sometimes you&rsquo;ve realized there&rsquo;s a way you can dramatically improve processes at your organization. Or maybe you&rsquo;ve gotten a request from a business unit to help out.</p><p> Regardless of how you got the project, you&rsquo;re in charge of developing a solution. If you and your team are stuck for ideas, consider these techniques:</p><li> <strong>  Begin with the end in mind.  </strong> Investigate what other organizations have done to accomplish what you&rsquo;re trying to do. Would this approach work for your company?</li><li> <strong>  Anything you can do, I can do better! </strong>  What would the project look like if IT took the lead? What about HR? Marketing? Accounting? A change in perspective can definitely change your project.</li><li> <strong>  If only things were different . . .  </strong> What if you had twice the time to complete the project? Or half the time? What if you had an unlimited budget? What if you outsourced or insourced the work? <br/>  </li><p> Remember, a business case addresses the question, &ldquo;What happens if we take this course of action?&rdquo; but you also need to consider the consequences of doing nothing. This will help you articulate the business need when you state your case.</p><p> For example: &ldquo;If we stick with our current method of processing invoices, we will average a 21-day turnaround time. This project will drop that to two days, allowing us to avoid rehiring three positions.&rdquo;</p><h3> Get stakeholder buy-in</h3><p> <br/> To build a strong case, you&rsquo;ll need to sketch in broad strokes how your organization would implement the solution you&rsquo;re proposing. This helps you see whose support you&rsquo;ll need. If you start to think through the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and suddenly realize that HR and Accounting will have to contribute resources, you&rsquo;ll need to get information from them and get their buy-in before you present the case.</p><h3> Develop an ROI analysis</h3><p> <br/> By building a business case based on ROI analysis, you&rsquo;re better able to combat the concerns of limited resources and growing demand&mdash;so stakeholders can make a sound decision. Fernando Rocha, Tax Administrator at Olmsted &amp; Associates, a CPA firm, was able to report a 25% savings across the board for processing paperwork and cutting overhead costs for their technology initiative. Documenting cost savings in hard numbers such as office space, supplies and working hours can help your case.</p><p> While an ROI analysis may seem a bit daunting, taking the time to build a complete analysis will enable you to quantify and articulate the benefits your project will bring to your organization, ultimately helping you win the support of stakeholders.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to take the advice in this post at face value.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=tenetpartners&amp;original_referer=http://tenetpartners.com/perspectives/take5/when-to-refresh-your-brand.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tenet Partners  </u> </a>  </p><p> It seems like it was just yesterday that you launched your new positioning, tagline, logo, website, signage and advertising campaign. Now your team is telling you that it might be time to give it all an update. What do you do?</p><p> First thing is to remember that a brand is much more than just a logo. It encompasses everything that contributes toward customer experience, including culture and how you deliver your product or service.</p><p> Even if, subjectively, some are unhappy with your brand expression, you have to evaluate it objectively. Rebranding is an expensive endeavor; you should only do it to solve a strategic issue. Due to the time it takes to build familiarity and positive perceptions, it is often when the internal team begins to tire of your current messaging that external audiences are just beginning to catch on. Just because you feel like you need a change doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you do.</p><p> Nonetheless, your brand is an essential business tool. If it is not helping you achieve your strategic goals, no matter how attached you are to your brand promise or your current campaigns, it may be time to take a fresh look at them.</p><p> Here are five signs it&rsquo;s time to reevaluate your brand strategy.</p><h3> 1. Your brand scores are slipping</h3><p> <br/> Akin to servicing a car, you need to keep tabs on the functioning of your brand. If you regularly research your brand&rsquo;s relevance with key audiences and periodically fine tune your messaging then you will get a lot more miles out of the brand than if you drive it off the showroom floor and never get it serviced. At a minimum, annual brand health surveys with external and internal audiences can keep you from suffering any major brand breakdowns. At best, you can solicit feedback in real-time from your customers, employees, and constituencies so you can respond quickly and efficiently.</p><h3> 2. The business strategy changes</h3><p> <br/> Brand strategy always follows business strategy. Perhaps the leadership team has decided that doubling revenues by acquisition is the goal for the next five years. Or maybe an IPO is in the not-so-distant future. Or the opportunity has arisen to enter a new international market. As a critical tool for rationalizing your portfolio and building market appeal, your brand needs to align with, support, and reflect your business strategy. It is the story that holds your business together and it must be told clearly and consistently to have proper impact.</p><h3> 3. Competitive pressures have increased</h3><p> <br/> Whether there are new entrants in your industry or a groundbreaking technological advance, when the dynamics of your industry shift, you need to make sure you aren&rsquo;t being left behind. &ldquo;Clear, relevant, believable and distinct&rdquo; is the mantra we use to keep us on track when developing a brand positioning. When market dynamics change, so can your ability to stand out from the crowd and be unique. If a &ldquo;me too&rdquo; provider pops up with a vociferous awareness campaign, you run the danger of becoming a referential brand: &ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re just like X only we&rsquo;ve been around longer.&rdquo; You need to retool your messages to stand apart, even if it is as simple as being sure to include your years of expertise in your outreach.</p><h3> 4. Your brand expression looks dated</h3><p> <br/> Ideally your original brand strategy was both cutting edge and sustainable. But sometimes market tastes shift beneath you. Just look at all of the companies out there with the word &ldquo;cyber&rdquo; in their name, or, more recently, how many logos have all lowercase, san-serif, colorful fonts. Whether it&rsquo;s an elegant refinement of your current logo or starting from scratch, your brand expression needs to match your cultural personality in tone and manner. You can&rsquo;t credibly claim to be innovative if your logo is stuck in the 1980s.</p><h3> 5. You want to signal change</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes you just need an opportunity to tell a new story. It could be because you have a change in business strategy, or new leadership, or you have identified a sizeable shift in your core audiences. Perhaps you have merged with another firm and together have more to offer than the sum of your two parts. A refreshed look and feel, a new tagline &ndash; even a new name &ndash; may be what you need to attract attention, build awareness and capture the market share you desire.</p><p> Whatever the reason is for reevaluating your brand, whenever possible, existing brand equity should be retained. Just as when you&rsquo;re building your brand, whatever strategic and tactical plan you take on should be fact-based and built to achieve specific goals. Change should never be made simply for change sake.</p>",

    "content": "<p> People always talk about how to create high performance teams and organizations, and they all have different views as to how this can be achieved. The question is if they really do understand what is actually happening within those &lsquo;almost perfect&rsquo; organizations.</p><p> Forming high performance teams and organizations is a process, but it isn&rsquo;t as complicated or difficult as many of us think. It may be challenging, but if you put in enough time and energy into it, it won&rsquo;t take time before you can create an organization that performs to its full potential.</p><h3> Important Traits of High Performance Organizations</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Communicating Parameters </strong></p><p> It is important for managers to tell their staff what their roles are in the organization. There are a couple of ways employees may know what is expected of them, one of which is through the job description.</p><p> Surprisingly, not all businesses use job descriptions, and this is often a cause of problems. If employees don&rsquo;t have a clear understanding of what their job is, there is no way you can expect them to perform well.</p><p> The operational business plan is another tool for communicating roles. In an operational business plan, the goals for the company are outlined, along with the steps required to achieve them.</p><p> <strong>  Empowerment </strong></p><p> Once your people begin to understand what their role is and what goals the company is trying to achieve, they become more capable of making good decisions. Managers don&rsquo;t always have to decide for the group. By empowering your staff, you can rely on them more to make choices that will benefit the organization or the company.</p><p> <strong>  Establishment of Performance Criteria </strong></p><p> This shouldn&rsquo;t be a difficult process as long as you have a business plan and a job description. These tools will set the parameters and will make it easier for you to measure your workers&rsquo; individual performances. It is recommended also that you let your people know that their success is being monitored. This will help motivate them and keep them engaged in the success of the group.</p><p> <strong>  Holding People Accountable </strong></p><p> It becomes much easier for managers to hold people accountable when everyone understands what their roles and responsibilities are, and how they are being evaluated. As a manager, you should not hesitate to hold any of your staff accountable because the truth is, people perform better when they are given accountability.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/what-is-mentoring/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   For a manager to successfully create a high performance organization  </a> </u> , there&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done. You must know what you want from your people; let them know your expectations; measure their performance; and hold them accountable. While this sounds really complicated and difficult to do, having it as part of your system will allow you to have more time to focus on the other more important aspects of running your business.</p>",

    "title": "Not for Men Only! The Etiquette of the Handshake",
    "link": "not-for-men-only-the-etiquette-of-the-handshake",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> &ldquo;When did women start shaking hands? It feels awkward.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> A very bright, talented, professional woman asked me that question. Initially, I was startled. Yet, as I thought about the question, I realized that many women in my seminars are reluctant to shake hands, and others do so incorrectly. <br/> <br/> In today&rsquo;s workplace, shaking hands is not for men only. The handshake is the business greeting: Both men and women need to shake hands, and to do so correctly. <br/> <br/> One woman told me she got her job because she shook hands at the beginning of the interview and again at the end. The manager told the woman that he chose her because she handled herself so professionally. Another woman realized that she had been the only one at her table who stood when she shook hands with her CEO.  As a result, she had a conversation with him; the other individuals did not.    <br/> <br/> Why do women sometimes feel uncomfortable about shaking hands? The reasons vary: <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Some women were never taught to shake hands. </strong>  It is not that these women were told not to do so, it is that they were not  taught  to do so. One woman in an etiquette class was shocked when she realized that she was not teaching her four-year-old daughter to shake hands, but she had already started teaching her two-year-old son to shake hands. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Women bring the personal greeting of kissing friends on the cheek into the workplace.  </strong> This can be awkward, since you will not want to kiss or hug everyone you meet at work, nor will everyone be comfortable with that greeting. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Many women were taught that they did not need to stand when shaking hands. </strong>  Before each of my seminars, I walk around the room to introduce myself to my participants and extend my hand in a greeting. Approximately 70 to 75 percent of men, but only 30 to 35 percent of women, stand to shake my hand. You establish your presence when you stand. Both men and women should stand when shaking hands. <br/> <br/> You will be judged by your handshake. Be honest: What do you think if someone gives you a limp handshake? Yes, you tend to think of that person as weak and unimpressive. <br/> <br/> To shake hands properly:</p><li> Extend your hand with the thumb up. </li><li> Touch thumb joint to thumb joint with the person you are greeting. Put your thumb down, and wrap your fingers around the palm of the other person.  </li><li> Make sure your grip is firm, but don&rsquo;t break any bones &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a competition. </li><li> Don&rsquo;t over-pump. Two to three pumps is enough. Face the person, and make eye contact.  <br/>  </li><p> And one more thing: It used to be that men needed to wait for a woman to extend her hand. Not anymore. The new guideline is to give the higher-ranking person a split second to extend his or her hand, and if he or she does not, you extend yours. The key is that the handshake needs to take place. </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  A client makes a referral when they tell someone else about you and recommend that they call you. </strong> And 90% of the time those people don&rsquo;t actually contact you. Even small improvements in the proportion of people who hear about you that actually make the call can make a big difference in the growth of your business.</p><p> One advisor, let&rsquo;s call him Sam, knew his clients spoke well of him, and he was perplexed over why he didn&rsquo;t get more referred clients. So he started asking. He contracted with a firm to do a survey of clients, and included the question of whether they had mentioned him to anyone in the past year. He was shocked at how many had, yet his phone wasn&rsquo;t ringing all that often. Now Sam was REALLY curious!</p><p> He started asking clients two questions at the end of appointments: Have you mentioned me to anyone recently? And, if they had, he asked &ldquo;What exactly did you say to them?&rdquo; It was an epiphany.</p><p> After half a dozen of these conversations, he realized that clients could not remember the key elements of his description of what set him apart from other advisors. They could not remember his description of the ideal client &ndash; exactly the kind of client he wanted them to refer. Even though Sam had spent a lot of time developing a detailed description of who he most wanted to meet and the specific services he had to offer them. They ended up talking about how much they liked him and what good service he provided. Nice things to hear, to be sure, but he could easily see why it did not bring in calls. They were not enough to get people to pick up the phone. Today. Like I need to talk to that guy Sam right away.</p><p> He made another discovery that was even more interesting, and had him slapping his forehead. Of course! What WAS successful at getting friends to call? When a client told their own story of how Sam had solved their problem creatively and successfully and their friend had the same problem!</p><h3> People don&rsquo;t remember facts and features and benefits.  People remember stories about people.</h3><p> <br/> They probably won&rsquo;t remember your positioning statement or value proposition. They may remember a story about how you solved that same problem for another client.</p><p> A lot has been written about the importance of storytelling when explaining things to clients, whether it be so that clients understand the recommendation you are making to them or to help them  <u>  understand your marketing message </u> . Stories  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.duarte.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   move people  </a> </u> . We are  <u>  <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5965703/the-science-of-storytelling-why-telling-a-story-is-the-most-powerful-way-to-activate-our-brains\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wired to respond to them  </a> </u> . You have seen  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/blogs/marketing-maven-marie-swift-advisors-storytelling-2679437-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this point  </a> </u>  made in  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth-manager/2012/02/16/the-power-of-storytelling/\" target=\"_blank\">   articles  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Storyselling-Financial-Advisors-Producers-Sell/dp/0793136644/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366917500&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=storytelling+for+financial+advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   books  </a> </u>  aimed at financial advisors.</p><p> But there is another reason to tell stories &ndash; because clients are more likely to remember them and be able to repeat them to others.</p><p> Referral marketing is about spreading your expertise and your reputation through people you know to people you don&rsquo;t know. You may be able to get clients to repeat the carefully worded positioning statements and elevator pitches you have put together but my suspicion is that clients are not that interested in studying to be your sales representatives. They may, however, remember an interesting story you tell them and be able to recall the key points when someone reminds them of a similar scenario.</p><p> Want people to tell their friends about the amazing solution you provided them in a way that will have them writing down your name and looking you up when they get home? <strong>  Well, let me tell you about one client who had EXACTLY that problem&hellip; </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Courtney Emerson | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.geteverwise.com%2Fauthor%2Fcourtney-emerson&amp;screen_name=geteverwise&amp;tw_p=followbutton\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Everwise  </u> </a>  </p><p> Mark Twain once wisely advised: &ldquo;Keep away from small people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.&rdquo;</p><p> Unfortunately, a recent study indicates that, in general, women don&rsquo;t have access to the latter once they enter the workplace. The  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/05/companies-drain-womens-ambition-after-only-2-years\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bain &amp; Company study  </a> </u>  found that while men and women enter the workforce with equal ambition, women experience a major drop in aspiration to top jobs at their company (and confidence they will reach them) after just two years.</p><p> The numbers are staggering; for women more than two years on the job, aspiration to achieve a C-suite position dropped 60% and confidence that they would make it there nearly 50% from when they began working (by comparison, men&rsquo;s dropped only 10%).</p><br /><br /> <p> And while women regain some of that aspiration and confidence once they reach more senior levels of the organization, men and women never again reach parity. Also of note in their findings is an important myth buster: contrary to popular belief that women lose their interest in top jobs once they have children, these finding held regardless of if the women were married or were parents. <br/>  </p><h3> Why This Matters</h3><p> <br/> To understand just how problematic this finding is, we need to take a step back and remember three things. First, women are graduating from college at unprecedented rates &ndash; in fact now  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/01/29/women-more-likely-than-men-to-graduate-college-at-22/\" target=\"_blank\">   out graduating their male peers  </a> </u> . In other words, any company interested in building a pipeline of the best and the brightest for future leadership must effectively recruit, engage and promote women.</p><p> Second, women in leadership have a tremendous positive impact on the bottom line: companies with women in leadership positions have  <u>  <a href=\"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/74/2/208.short\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   greater profit and greater market share  </a> </u> . And third, women are motivated not just by the desire to do well but to do good: in fact,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.american.edu/spa/wpi/upload/Girls-Just-Wanna-Not-Run_Policy-Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   83% of women college students  </a> </u>  say that when thinking about the future, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;important that I volunteer to help improve my community&rdquo; (compared to 73% of their male peers). </p><p> Suffice it to say; to build organizations comprised of the best and brightest that are highly innovative and drive positive change in our communities, sustaining women&rsquo;s ambition and confidence to leadership is of critical importance.  </p><h3> What's Happening?</h3><p> <br/> The report cites the celebration and recognition of a &ldquo;hero&rsquo;s&rdquo; culture &ndash; when those celebrated by leadership are men pulling all-nighters to complete a deliverable or sacrificing their personal lives to satisfy the demands of a client &ndash; and which alienates women.</p><p> This certainly aligns with what I&rsquo;ve heard countless women say about their workplace experiences. One women once told me that she would never understand why her male colleagues were celebrated for saving the day at the 11th hour on an important project &ndash; and why she and her female colleagues weren&rsquo;t when they worked hard to create systems and processes that eliminated risk and the need for heroics in the first place.</p><p> The study also found that many of women&rsquo;s direct supervisors were not supportive of their aspirations (or even aware of them), instead making assumptions about their female employees ambitions and career goals.</p><h3> How We Can Fix It</h3><p> <br/> The report cites the importance of role models &ndash; but this only works if there are role models at the top. And with very few women in C-suite roles and huge numbers of women in the professional workforce, it seems a lot to ask of the few at the top to serve as role models or mentors for all professional women. </p><p> So what can we do now to create change?</p><p> 1) Develop more inclusive managers and leaders (and hold them accountable for demonstrating inclusive behaviors): It&rsquo;s not enough to celebrate different ways of working &ndash; we need to change the way leaders behave and engage with their teams every day to really shift an organization&rsquo;s culture and values.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.talentinnovation.org/_private/assets/IDMG-ExecSummFINAL-CTI.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research from the Center for Talent Innovation  </a> </u>  found that there are six key inclusive leader behaviors that ensure everyone is heard:</p><li> Ensures that everyone speaks up and gets heard</li><li> Makes it safe to risk proposing novel ideas</li><li> Empowers team members to make decisions</li><li> Takes advice and implements feedback</li><li> Gives actionable feedback</li><li> Shares credit for team success </li><br /><p> The positive impact of demonstrating these behaviors bears out quantitatively; when leaders demonstrate at least 3 of them, employees are significantly more likely to feel welcome and included in their team (87% v. 51%), free to express their views and opinions (87% v. 46%), and feel their ideas are heard and recognized (74% v. 37%). But it&rsquo;s also not enough as an organization to say that these behaviors are important &ndash; they must be tied to performance evaluations and financial incentives (especially if they&rsquo;re just being introduced to the organization).</p><p> 2) Connect women with mentors outside of their organizations: We&rsquo;re all familiar with mentorship programs that connect mentees to more senior (or peer) mentors within the organization. But one of the most important roles a mentor can play is acting as a sounding board and listening to their mentee&rsquo;s concerns and challenges. Women especially may be hesitant to talk about these types of challenges to a more senior employee within the company &ndash; especially if they feel the company culture doesn&rsquo;t value their perspective. Matching women with mentors of both genders outside of the company can give women access to resources that provide an important outside perspective in a safe space.</p><p> 3) Create channels for women to build sponsorship relationships: As discussed above, external mentors are important &ndash; but so are internal sponsors. Sponsors are different from mentors: mentors give you advice, but sponsors use their relationships and their power to advocate for you, whether that be for a promotion or stretch assignment. But sponsors can advocate for their prot&eacute;g&eacute; in other ways as well &ndash; for example, they can advocate for different ways of working. Just because a job has been done one way in the past (e.g., being &ldquo;on&rdquo; 24/7 or traveling constantly), doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be done that way in the future or even to be successful in that role. Sponsors can ensure the prot&eacute;g&eacute; is able to perform the job roles and responsibilities in a way that works for him/her, and provide air cover to ensure they&rsquo;re successful, particularly if that job has never been done that way before (for example, working part time or doing the job outside of HQ). </p><p> In other words: mentors and sponsors are key to sustaining women&rsquo;s ambitions and ensuring that women can work in ways that work for them. To Mark Twain&rsquo;s point, let&rsquo;s create organizations in which people &ndash; mentors, managers, and sponsors &ndash; make employees from all background feel they have equal opportunity to become great.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When deciding whether or not to get married the impact of a change in marital status on social security benefits could be financially significant. The effect could be as much as $100,000 or more in lifetime benefits if a couple were married versus single and it could also materially affect survivor benefits. <br/> <br/> For example, I completed a social security income maximization plan for a couple who had been living together for the past 20 years and neither had been previously married. Since they only lived together and never got married, as far as social security is concerned, they are both considered single for benefit purposes. <br/> <br/> This couple met with me in order to find out how much more, if any, their social security benefits would be as a married couple versus two single filers. Furthermore, they wanted to know if the timing of their potential marriage would affect their social security benefits. <br/> <br/> In their particular case the man was age 67, had a near maximum social security benefit and was still working. The woman was age 62, retired and had a social security benefit approximately equal to 70% of his benefit amount. After gathering all the necessary financial and non-financial data I ran multiple possible scenarios as a married couple and also as two single filers. <br/> <br/> Two key factors in their particular situation were their differences in age and benefit amounts. I assumed, based on their health status and family history, that they would both likely reach normal life expectancy. However, because of their 5 year age difference and the fact that she is a women we would, statistically speaking, expect that she would likely outlive him by about 7-8 years. Given that likely possibility, the need to consider survivor benefits for the women was very important in this case as we would expect that she would eventually be living on only one social security check as a widow for those 7-8 years. Therefore, maximizing that survivor check would be critical. <br/> <br/> The other important consideration would be the difference in lifetime benefits as they live their retirement years as a single couple versus a married couple. As a married couple there are a number of strategies available to co-ordinate spousal benefits, thereby providing additional lifetime benefits, that would not be available if they remained single in retirement. <br/> <br/> So, are these differences in social security benefits for this single couples versus married couples material?  My analysis showed that as a married couple they would be eligible to receive an additional $160,000 in lifetime benefits as compared to retiring as a single couple! If they exceeded normal life expectancy this additional benefit would be even more pronounced. <br/> <br/> Additionally, the impact on the survivor benefit for the woman was also significant. As a married couple her expected survivor benefit, assuming he lived to normal life expectancy, would provide her with over $800/month in additional benefits. This is because his benefit amount was higher than hers and as a spouse she would be eligible to switch to his higher benefit, instead of simply retaining her own lower benefit if he predeceased her. Since she is expected to outlive him by 7-8 years this is a material benefit to her especially since she will be going from living off of both of their social security checks to just her survivor check. <br/> <br/> It is also important to note that since women live longer than men they are more likely to need and utilize long-term care services, whether in a nursing home or at home. Receiving additional social security benefits later in retirement can help to defray some of these and other health care costs. <br/> <br/> Social security benefits in and of themselves are clearly not a sufficient reason for a single couple to make the decision to get married. However, when couples do their retirement income planning it may be prudent to also look at the implications on social security benefits and other financial assets which are impacted by marital status. The disparity in benefits could exceed tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. For many couples, this could have a material impact on their ability to finance their retirement.</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you make them feel.&rdquo; Maya Angelou</p><p> In the social media marketing community, there are a lot of strategies we use to connect with our audience, multiple ways in which we share content, and different content types we utilize to share a brand&rsquo;s story.</p><p> But there is none as important as the element of emotions in all that we do, specifically, storytelling. Maya Angelou knew that what connects us runs much deeper than our words or actions, it&rsquo;s the human connection that makes us bond, makes us fall in love, and endears us to anything in life.</p><p> This human connection is emotions and the imparting of it in how we connect with one another online.</p><p> About a month ago, I presented a keynote at the Social Media Strategies Summit in NYC about this very topic, and I want to break it down for you because this message explains the foundational element of social media, how we use it to interact, how it assists us to develop relationships, and inevitably promote our businesses.</p><p> Take a moment with me to think of the people most loved in your life. See their faces, remember their voices, the way they look when they&rsquo;re happy, the things they like and those they do not. I bet these people have an abundance of excellent character traits, but when it comes down to it, it&rsquo;s how they make you feel about yourself or how you feel around them that makes them so special.</p><p> This feeling is one you should hold onto as I continue to explain why emotions play such a crucial part in social media storytelling. Because when we get all caught up in the data and conversions related to social media, we forget that the people we&rsquo;re dealing with everyday are just like those we care most about. They are the humans on the other side.</p><p> But first, let&rsquo;s take a step back and review.</p><h3> Why is storytelling important to social media?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Endears us  </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. Helps us to remember </strong>  </p><p> When you think of puppies and clydesdale horses, what brand do you think of? If you guessed Budweiser then you&rsquo;re right! We all remember the lost puppy commercial for Budweiser from this year&rsquo;s Super Bowl because it pained us to see this puppy lost, and then we rejoiced when he made it back. That story helped us to remember Budweiser simply by pulling on our heart strings.</p><p> <strong>  3. Develops trust and credibility  </strong></p><p> Without understanding the story of a brand, we won&rsquo;t ever get to know it. And if we don&rsquo;t feel like we know a brand then we will never develop feelings for it.</p><p> <strong>  4. Humanizes  </strong></p><p> There is a human element to every business, but we must share that if we ever want to humanize it into a brand.</p><p> And what is a brand? My definition is simple: it&rsquo;s a business who&rsquo;s learned how to make its customers and online audience feel something about it. It&rsquo;s crossed the threshold of just being another business selling something.</p><p> But the deal is, NONE of these points are possible without emotions being an active part of that storytelling. If we aren&rsquo;t finding our way into the hearts and mind of our audience then our stories will never be successful.</p><h3> Why are emotions important to storytelling?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Makes a story relatable </strong></p><p> If a story isn&rsquo;t relatable, then its hard to.. (next point)</p><p> <strong>  2. Create a connection </strong></p><p> A connection is necessary for people to feel something. Do you hang out with people you don&rsquo;t feel connected to? No.</p><p> <strong>  3. Establishes loyalty </strong></p><p> Brand loyalty cannot exist without a person feeling for a product/service because there are plenty of other similar products/services available.</p><p> <strong>  4. Humanizes a story </strong></p><p> We can tell stories all day, but without emotions they fall short. Similar to a lackluster story told by a friend &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t keep our attention unless there&rsquo;s emotion involved.</p><p> But wait a minute &ndash; business and emotions don&rsquo;t mix! At least, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve heard many business owners say, but oh yes they do!! Why?</p><p> <strong>  1. Emotions are the primary drivers of ALL of our online and offline actions.  </strong> They&rsquo;re involved in every decision we make, especially when it comes to purchases.</p><p> <strong>  2. Emotional benefits make a business special. </strong>  Why? Because&hellip; The rational elements of a business do little to differentiate itself from the competition. Considering going to the store to pick up eggs. They&rsquo;re basically all the exact same, but we buy under the guise of wanting to feel good about how the chicken are raised versus just nabbing the cheap ones. Right?</p><h3> So now that you understand WHY emotions are critical, HOW will you implement them into your storytelling?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Discover what your audience wants from you, beyond the features. </strong></p><p> Every buyer is looking for a particular set of features in a product or service, but they&rsquo;re also wanting to emotionally connect with it. Think about it &ndash; we make purchases all the time on products that are made by a variety of brands, i.e. food, clothing, etc. yet we choose certain products for different reasons.</p><p> A good example is restaurants. A feature would be good food, but the emotional connection would be feeling at home, the food reminding you of your mother&rsquo;s, feeling like you&rsquo;re a part of the cool neighborhood it&rsquo;s in or feeling comfortable.</p><p> I&rsquo;m a mega foodie since I grew up in restaurants and typically know which ones offer good food. So when I make a decision to go out to eat, my #1 deciding factor is where I will be the most comfortable.</p><p> Our customers and clients can probably find whatever it is we&rsquo;re selling in multiple places &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got to find out what emotional benefits they&rsquo;re looking for and then capitalize on them in our storytelling.</p><p> <strong>  2. Develop and maintain a consistent brand voice. </strong></p><p> Without a consistent brand voice to become familiar with, any brand will have a difficult time connecting with its audience. Think about it, we are most drawn to people who are consistently themselves, regardless of what that self is like. We trust and like consistency on an unconscious level, so if our stories are all over the place or the voice we use in which to tell them is constantly changing, we move away.</p><p> When we take one a new client with ARCH, they must sign a contract that says only ARCH Specialists will operate the social accounts. This isn&rsquo;t done to take away control or be in charge, it&rsquo;s to ensure that the brand voice remains consistent.</p><p> <strong>  3. Personalize. </strong></p><p> Our society is becoming obsessed with personalization &ndash; from the radio stations fashioned to our personal music tastes to VIP service &ndash; we love it. And that flows right into the stories we tell. We need to know exactly who our target audience is so that we can speak to them personally with our storytelling. Otherwise, even the best stories will fall flat.</p><p> <strong>  4. Ask questions. </strong></p><p> I read that questions in social media are dead, especially on Facebook, and I&rsquo;m like &ndash; are you crazy??? People LOVE to talk, share, voice their opinion, and show what they know. We can tell the coolest stories all day long, but if we don&rsquo;t invite them into the conversation and find ways to make our stories interactive, then we&rsquo;ll miss out on opportunities to develop lasting relationships.</p><p> <strong>  5. Hone in on extreme emotions. </strong></p><p> By this I mean, let&rsquo;s make people laugh and make them cry. No matter how busy I am during my day, if I come across something that looks funny I&rsquo;ll stop and check it out. Why? Because life is busy and chaotic, and can always use an excuse to laugh. And our audience is the same way. Utilizing humor in our storytelling seems like a no-brainer, but many businesses sidestep it for fear they&rsquo;ll upset someone. But we&rsquo;ve got to step out to find out. If it matches the brand, then all is well.</p><p> By making people cry, I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that literally. I&rsquo;m saying, let&rsquo;s touch on the softer emotions &ndash; empathy and compassion. We can take a bland product like a pacemaker and pair it with a story about a man who lost his job and was on the verge of losing his family home, but was able to regain everything after one operation. All of a sudden, we feel something for that pacemaker. And that is the power of emotions in our storytelling.</p>",

Thanks to modern technology, you might be able to push off that conversation for a few more years.</p><p> The answer might be to simply buy a new car.</p><p> There are occasions before giving a seminar on &ldquo; <u>  having the talk </u> ,&rdquo; when people will ask if I&rsquo;ll be discussing the birds and the bees. There comes a time when adult children must have a conversation, or series of conversations, with aging parents to discuss later life issues, such as wills, estates and the like. This is what we mean by &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/having-the-talk-about-retirement-2012-12-24\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   having the talk  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> Often people tell me that they look forward to my seminar because they want to have &ldquo;the talk&rdquo; soon with their parents &mdash; but they&rsquo;re not interested in wills and estates. They want to <strong>  tell their parents for their own safety, and the safety of others, that it&rsquo;s time to stop driving. </strong></p><p> The moment that one's children request that they give up their ability to drive is a blow to one's sense of freedom, pride and independence. It isn't a moment that anyone enjoys having.</p><p> Unfortunately, like most aspects of &ldquo;the talk,&rdquo; it's a necessary and vital conversation that we'll likely have. Knowing how to address it properly and with compassion is important &mdash; but not yet.</p><p> Not until you&rsquo;ve explored what&rsquo;s available in newer car models.

Sheryl points out that discussing the need to take away a parent's car keys \"is a difficult talk because it's about one's dignity.\"</p><p> Connelly believes that the work that car companies are doing to improve the safety for drivers of their automobiles can have a major impact on the ability for seniors to drive longer and safer.

The suit restricts some of the mobility that the older driver may have in a typical car, such as stiffening their knee joints to understand how they get in and out of an automobile or using gloves to limit the strength that seniors may have in their hands (The gloves mimic the reduction of tactile sensation in the fingertips). It even addresses specific conditions such as the impact that diabetes or glaucoma can have on the older driver.</p><img src=\"http://ei.marketwatch.com//Multimedia/2015/07/01/Photos/NS/MW-DP219_third__20150701151503_NS.gif?uuid=7e5a830e-2025-11e5-be36-0bd7b77038cd\"/>Source: Ford Motor Co.

    "content": "<p> Investors in startups are weird: they don&rsquo;t like to lose money. A funny quirk no doubt, but that&rsquo;s how they roll. They pass on most offers. And the few deals they make? They usually don&rsquo;t work out as planned. In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bhorowitz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ben Horowitz  </a> </u>  (celebrity venture capitalist) says  <strong>  in any given year, only 15 companies will go on to mass success. </strong>  Of course success is a relative term. But can you really blame investors for being a little skittish about writing checks? Well, yeah, you  could , but bitterness isn&rsquo;t a great look.</p><p> Think about it. What would you do in their shoes? Wouldn&rsquo;t you look for the safest bet? A company tackling real (not make-believe) problems? A product that&rsquo;s been tested and validated to some degree? For founders who are intelligent  and  scrappy?</p><p> OK, then, it&rsquo;s settled. Investors are  just like you  (minus the ramen noodle diet). They wanna attach their name to something great and hopefully&hellip; hopefully get paid in the end. So before putting too much time and tears into your company, start preparing now for that day in the future when you&rsquo;ll ask strangers to open their wallets.</p><p> <strong>  Get into the habit of imagining your startup from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective. </strong>  You know, the whole forest-instead-of-trees thing. It may sound corny but that mindset works. Investors like founders who think big and strategic, like a CEO. They avoid founders who act like dorkville bean counters.</p><h3> First Things First</h3><p> <br/> If your startup is still in the early stage, where all you have is an idea or Minimum Viable Product (MVP), your top priority should be studying the market and identifying potential customers. This is the essence of product/market fit. Or to put it in Lean terms,  <strong>  you learn first, build and then measure. </strong></p><br /><p> You&rsquo;ll learn some things during your research that will change your product. Some of that will come from the internet, some from talking to potential customers. You&rsquo;ll probably end up dropping a cool feature&hellip; or three.  <strong>  It could even mean scrapping 90% of your initial assumptions. </strong>  Pivoting like this is inevitable and it does kinda suck, BUT it&rsquo;s sooo much better than launching a product nobody wants. And that will happen unless you invest enough time and money into studying market conditions.</p><p> <strong>  Finding people who are experiencing the problems you&rsquo;re solving for and asking them to share that journey is invaluable. </strong> You&rsquo;ll find plenty of help from the types that love the idea that their stories will be considering during the creation process. Of course it&rsquo;s still nice to thank them with a tweet, a high-five or a bro hug.  <strong>  Keep in mind, these people might turn into the early adopters who help launch your product when it&rsquo;s ready. </strong></p><p> Now if you&rsquo;re already up and running but hope to pitch investors eventually, there are definite metrics you&rsquo;ll be asked about. Monitor these numbers closely and they&rsquo;ll direct which way you should go (kind of like  The Force ).  <strong>  Investors love to see company founders who can properly interpret metrics and harness them into a coherent, attractive, and ambitious pitch. </strong>  Here are those metrics:</p><p> <strong>  Cohort Analysis </strong>  &ndash;not a metric per se, but it&rsquo;s the foundation for nearly every data point in the life of a startup.  <strong>  A cohort is a group of people who have shared an event over a period of time. </strong>  For example, the people who moved to a new city in the last month. Tracking the number of times these people ate out in the month following their move would be a cohort analysis. It&rsquo;s a way to tag customers so that you can observe their behavior.</p><p> Up close and personal with a cohort analysis</p><p> What kind of startups use cohort analysis? All of them &mdash; marketplaces, social media, apps, e-commerce, platforms. All industries, too &mdash; education, health care, finance, media, etc.</p><p> <strong>  Margins </strong>  &mdash; gross margins are the first question investors will ask you about. If the profit margin for your product is low, you&rsquo;ll have a much harder time trying to win them over. That is unless you have a bulletproof method for scaling up.</p><p> <strong>  You calculate gross margins by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from revenue, divided by revenue. </strong>  Sounds complicated, but it&rsquo;s not. Margins are industry specific. A few examples: cloud storage can have margins around 90%, SaaS averages about 70%, consumer goods usually under 50%. Potential investors will know the margins for your industry. If your margins are pathetically below average, you&rsquo;ll have to fix the problem before pitching anyone or have a REALLY good explanation.</p><p> <strong>  Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)  </strong> &mdash; the cost of getting a customer to buy or use your product. It&rsquo;s probably the second thing investors will ask you about. There&rsquo;s no hard number for acquiring a customer; again, it depends on the industry. For example, a discount beauty supplier might only spend $2 on Pay-Per-Click advertising to land a customer, whereas a financial brokerage company might spend $250 to land a customer (banner ad, complimentary newsletter, six follow-up emails, 45-minute phone consult, etc.).</p><p> You can also break CAC out by specific channels: public relations, SEO, PPC. Some channels will work better for you than others. Track what it costs to acquire a lead, and then track the cost of each conversion step, until the lead becomes a customer. Drilling down like this will help you decide where in your funnel to spend less money and where to ratchet it up. CAC goes hand-in-hand with customer lifetime value.</p><p> <strong>  Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)  </strong> &mdash; the profit a customer will generate for you during the entirety of your relationship. Just so you know, no customer likes to hear you speak about your &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; with them&hellip; it just sounds a little needy. <br/> CLV correlates directly with CAC. You cannot stay in business for long &mdash; in any industry &mdash; if CAC &gt; CLV.  <strong>  Investors like to hear from companies who can pay back their CAC in less than a year. </strong>  If it takes more than a year, it means that your startup will need LOTS of money to grow. Many investors would rather put their money in a less vortex-like business.</p><p> <strong>  Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue (MRR/ARR) </strong>  &mdash; measurements of revenue streams such as subscription and maintenance fees. They don&rsquo;t include one-time fees. Like the other metrics, MRR or ARR can be broken down further:</p><li> MRR from new sales</li><li> MRR from renewals</li><li> MRR from upgrades <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Recurring revenue is VERY attractive to investors because it cuts down on CAC. </strong>  Investors will be interested in the trend, the growth momentum. If you sell a subscription service, MRR and/or ARR should be tattooed on your fingers. Both metrics are (roughly) an inverse to your churn rate.</p><p> <strong>  Churn rate  </strong> &mdash; the attrition rate for subscription services. That is,  <strong>  the percentage of customers who &mdash; in the relationship analogy &mdash; break up with you at any given time </strong>  (usually measured on a monthly basis). Getting dumped hurts, but more importantly a high churn rate negatively affects your CAC and CLV. Customers who leave you have to be replaced.  <strong>  A high churn rate could signal to potential investors that your company has a problem with customer service, value perception, competing offers, or switching costs. </strong></p><p> <strong>  The answer to reducing churn is to make it either easy for customers to stay or hard for them to leave (high switching costs). </strong>  You can accomplish both by constantly updating and improving your product&rsquo;s features, getting customers addicted to it through habit, and offering discounts for long-term commitments (i.e. annual subscriptions). Calculating monthly churn can get a little hairy once your company is growing. For example, do you count people who sign up for free trials &mdash; and then quit before the trial period ends &mdash; as customers?</p><p> Start measuring churn rate using simple numbers (100 customers on April 1st and 95 on May 1st = 5% churn). As you grow, you can refine the metric. Be warned, though, churn formulas can easily morph into equations straight out of calculus hell!</p><p> Check out how  <u>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/andrewchen\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Andrew Chen  </a> </u>  measures annual churn: <strong>   1 &ndash; (1-churn_rate) ^12. </strong>  If you can tell me what &ldquo;^&rdquo; stands for, I&rsquo;ll buy you a venti iced skinny macchiato.</p><p> <strong>  The whole point in critiquing your startup like an investor is to keep you focused during the ups and downs of startup life, until the day you start raising money. </strong>  A few metrics will determine your product&rsquo;s long-term viability. Getting funded is not the end game, it&rsquo;s just one BIG part of what it takes to scale an awesome or almost-awesome product.</p><p> All the money in the world won&rsquo;t save a bad idea! If you need proof of that, just look at what the government spends money on. Your future investors have been around the block and have seen enough to know &mdash; at  minimum  &mdash; what it&rsquo;ll take for a product to succeed.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As you stay in the financial advising business for a time, you will surely see more aging clients. People are living longer than ever in history. They are part of your practice now or they will be soon enough. With aging come risks:  cognitive decline, physical limitations and the need for care that can get very expensive. Will diminished capacity make your client vulnerable to abuse? Can you help protect your client by taking proactive steps right now?</p><p> You want to be of service, but you don&rsquo;t want to go overboard and become someone&rsquo;s social worker. What can you do to ensure your clients&rsquo; safety and well being as they age?</p><h3> Here are five tips for the conscious advisor who knows your client beyond managing the money.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  First, ask your client if she has done her estate planning </strong> , which should include appointing a trustworthy person to be her agent on a durable power of attorney and advance healthcare directive. Some have not gotten around to doing the estate planning, which can be a very expensive mistake. They want to wait &ldquo;until I get old&rdquo;. Some elders haven&rsquo;t looked at these documents in decades. Things may have changed. Know some competent estate lawyers and give your client some referrals in her area if she hasn&rsquo;t updated anything or if she hasn&rsquo;t done the job of estate planning at all yet.  Unfortunately, we know that most Americans haven&rsquo;t gotten around to getting even these basics done.</p><p> <strong>  Second, encourage your client to open the discussion with his heirs about the estate </strong> , the funds you manage, his investment philosophy and goals. It is an unfair burden on the adult child or children who must take over the reins when Dad loses independence if they have no preparation. Expecting them to navigate financial responsibilities when they start out knowing zero about Dad&rsquo;s money is risky at best and disastrous at worst. Support the client getting over the secrecy-about-money idea. It only leads to distress near the end of life or after he&rsquo;s gone.  You can facilitate the family discussion. Be a leader.</p><p> <strong>  Third, encourage your client to plan for the possibility of needing long term care. </strong> Most of us need help as we age. Very few people remain totally independent until the end with all the basics of daily life, like shopping, cooking, bathing and walking. A part time helper at home gets very expensive and Medicare doesn&rsquo;t pay for it at all. Work with your aging clients to think ahead and set assets aside for this specific purpose.</p><p> <strong>  Fourth, know the resources available in your client&rsquo;s community where you can send them for answers to questions you can&rsquo;t give them. </strong> Where can they find out about senior services? What if they don&rsquo;t have any children? How can they get help at home? Which Medicare plan is best?  A great place to start is the Area Agency on Aging, funded initially by the Older Americans Act, a Federal Law. Find out the local number in your client&rsquo;s area and hand it out to anyone who has a need for services and direction. If they have no children, connect them with resources to locate a licensed and experienced fiduciary.</p><p> <strong>  Fifth, watch for telltale signs of financial abuse. </strong> The world is loaded with scammers waiting to take advantage of vulnerable elders. Trusting seniors are ripped off every day, sometimes having life savings wiped out. Know the signs, and know cognitive impairment red flags. When a person&rsquo;s mind begins to decline with dementia or memory loss, she needs a watchful eye on her finances. You can report abuse, you can contact concerned family and you need not stand by helplessly. A proactive senior-specific policy will guide you as to the right steps to take when you see loss of capacity in an aging client.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As my son&rsquo;s fourth grade year came to a close, I sit bewildered at the passage of time.  Wasn&rsquo;t it just yesterday that he was Davy Crockett?  I smile, thinking back&hellip;</p><p> &ldquo;To be honest, mom&rdquo; said my then-third-grader, from the back seat of the car, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crazy about the book we&rsquo;re reading aloud. It&rsquo;s Davy Crockett.  But I get to be Davy, so that&rsquo;s cool.  I play Davy and the Sun.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;The Sun?&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;The Sun has lines?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Yep.  There&rsquo;s one page where it&rsquo;s all Davy and the Sun, so I read the entire page!  But mom&hellip;Davy&hellip;he&rsquo;s got such a huge EGO!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I asked, wondering how my little guy would define ego.</p><p> &ldquo;Well&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;when another character compliments him &ndash; which they do all the time &ndash; instead of saying &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;, he just says, &lsquo;I know!  And I&rsquo;m good at THIS too! And THAT too!  And THIS!  And THAT!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;So he brags a lot?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;A LOT!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Well you know&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to have  <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/blog/2015/03/16/how-confident-are-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  confidence </a> , but there&rsquo;s a big difference between confidence and ego.  What do you think it is?&rdquo;</p><p> I remember peaking at him through the rear view mirror, as he sat back there silently contemplating.  Finally he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;I think confidence is when you know you&rsquo;re good, but you don&rsquo;t feel like you have to tell everyone about it and make them feel bad.&rdquo;</p><h3> There&rsquo;s a big difference between confidence and ego.  Confidence doesn&rsquo;t make others feel bad.</h3><p>  </p><p> Such wisdom from a little guy.  Humility.</p><p> So later that night, I remember my kiddo and I cuddling up to watch Chopped before bed and there was an Executive Chef competing on the show who was&hellip;.a piece of work.  Throughout the show he was like a rooster strutting about, bragging, and superior, and condescending, and putting the others down.  He was a talented chef for sure, but he brought no humility.   And while some of it was likely dramatization for ratings, he still managed to drive us crazy.  Without prompt, Jeremy pointed to the guy and said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like the Davy Crockett of chefs!&rdquo; and we laughed.</p><p> For the rest of the show, we rooted against &ldquo;Mr. Ego&rdquo;.</p><p> One of the things I talk about in my work is the importance of owning your power.  The word power gets a bad rap, it can be very polarizing.  For some reason, when we talk about  <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/blog/2014/10/27/powerful-just-jerky/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  power </a>  in the context of work it tends to bring up visions of top-down, command-and-control leaders who will do anything to make themselves look good to win.  But when you think of the word empower &ndash; to give someone the power &ndash; then all of the sudden we&rsquo;re seeing sunshine and roses and happiness.  The problem isn&rsquo;t the power &ndash; it&rsquo;s in how we wield it.</p><p> For the definition of personal power I like the most is: &ldquo;Influence over others, the source of which resides in the person instead of being vested by the position he or s/he holds.&rdquo;.  Thus  <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/blog/2014/11/03/do-you-really-want-to-influence/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  influence  </a> requires choice.  It is different from force or coercion, as it assumes that people are choosing.  To choose something &ndash; to want it &ndash; is a heart decision.  While logic may play a role, logic will always be overturned by that &ldquo;gut instinct&rdquo;, by desire &ndash; by the heart.</p><p> So someone, who may be very talented, and very aware of their talents (a la Davy Crockett) but turns everyone else around him off because of how he makes them feel, is not, in my definition, powerful at all.   This person has no real influence.</p><h3> Influence is about choice. Someone who turns others off because of how they make them feel, has no real influence.</h3><p> <br/> I can&rsquo;t help but laugh at the memory of my son and I sitting together, watching to see who would get &ldquo;chopped&rdquo; &ndash; both of us  chanting, &ldquo;Chop Mr. Ego!  Chop Mr. Ego!&rdquo; (hey, he started it!).  And sure enough, when the big reveal was made, Mr. Ego&rsquo;s dish was on the chopping block.</p><p> And I remember it was a strange mixture of vindication and relief and sadness I felt, as Mr. Ego took his &ldquo;walk of shame&rdquo; down the corridor, making his snide remarks about the talented young chef who had beat him.</p><p> For underneath the cloak of &ldquo; <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/blog/2015/04/27/youre-not-all-that-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  I&rsquo;m-better-than </a> &rdquo; I have to believe that there is someone who is not so sure he is as good as he claims to be.  For if someone is truly powerful do they ever need to make someone else smaller?</p><p> If someone is truly powerful do they ever need to make someone else smaller?</p><p> And while I can empathize with him, I have to admit, I was still glad he lost.  I hope it&rsquo;s a lesson my son will carry with him for a long time to come.</p><p> Adios, Mr. Ego!</p>",

    "title": "The Real Reason Why Millennials Crave Feedback in the Workplace",
    "link": "the-real-reason-why-millennials-crave-feedback-in-the-workplace",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Millennials have grown up in an instant-access feedback cycle of the Internet and social media.</h3><p> <br/> This culture has bled into their working lives, where they seek quick and consistent feedback from their supervisors &mdash; far, far more than any generation that has come before.</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tinyhr.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-the-best-time-to-ask-for-feedback\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   our research  </a> </u>  and  <u>  Ultimate Software </u> :</p><li> 64% of employees surveyed said they wanted their supervisor to check in with them at least every two weeks</li><li> But 42% of millennials want feedback every week</li><li> And that&rsquo;s more than twice the percentage of every other generation <br/>  </li><p> Understanding this millennial psychology is a key step toward keeping them happy and engaged in your company. To do that, you have to see why they crave this constant feedback.</p><p> Remember that millennials entered the workforce in a time of great uncertainty. The recession brutalized hopes of a strong career, and there were few jobs (and little money) to be had. In a psychological study published by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~prestos/Downloads/DC/pdfs/Redman_Sept29_TwengeCampbell2008.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Emerald Insight  </a> </u> , two psychologists studied 1.4 million college students from 1938 until today&rsquo;s millennials. While millennials had more self-esteem, they also had more anxiety than ever before. Hence the desire to be aware of how they are performing every step of the way.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Misunderstand &ldquo;Feedback&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Despite the negative stereotypes about the &ldquo;me, me, me&rdquo; generation, millennials wanting constant feedback does not mean they want constant praise. In the Internet age of instant feedback, millennials are habitually attuned to this regular back-and-forth of feedback. Whereas older generations might see requiring this attention as somewhat confrontational, millennials see it as standard. They&rsquo;re looking for how to improve, what they&rsquo;re doing well, and constructive criticism, not constant applause.</p><p> Career Advancement Doesn&rsquo;t Just Mean a Pay Raise</p><p> Millennials want their work to mean something. They aren&rsquo;t punching in and out of work for the hourly rate; they&rsquo;re hoping to matter and to contribute to overall organizational goals. They want to believe in their work and the company values.</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/02/what-millennials-want-from-work-charted-across-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u> , 40% of millennials said being a leader was &ldquo;very important&rdquo; at their jobs. And they&rsquo;re willing to work for it, as 42% of North American millennials would work longer hours if it speeds up career progress. But it&rsquo;s not for the paycheck &mdash; employees reported that empowerment was most important.</p><p> In this case, the feedback is a &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; to ensure their manager is on the same page as they are. They need transparency into not only their progress but how that progress is affecting the company goals as a whole.</p><h3> This Isn&rsquo;t Your Traditional Manager</h3><p> <br/> In millennial minds, managers aren&rsquo;t just bosses; they&rsquo;re coaches. They&rsquo;re not just there to give out the paycheck. Managers are a key element to helping their personal and professional development. When that Emerald Insight psychological study looked into the qualities millennials felt they needed in a manager, the picture wasn&rsquo;t your traditional manager.</p><p> According to HBR, millennials wanted to be inspired by their managers. Millennials have a craving to latch onto causes and missions, and they see a manager as the person to push them to succeed there.</p><h3> Millennials in the workplace also picture an ideal manager as authentic and approachable. </h3><p> <br/> They&rsquo;re not the baby boomer generation; they are not satisfied with traditional, red-tape laden, bureaucratic hierarchies in the workplace. That feedback should come in an approachable way, from a manager that cares.</p><p> Despite the stereotypes, millennials&rsquo; desire for feedback isn&rsquo;t just about narcissism. Job anxiety and an instant-gratification culture have shaped their need for a coach-like manager to support them along the way.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Carmenroadsafet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Mahar  </u> </a></p><p> Motivational Speaker on Income Protection and Road Safety <br/> <br/> After joining the Insurance Industry with T&amp;G at age 24 as an agent, I enjoyed excellent sales success and was appointed Divisional Manager of the Bendigo office at age 28. I continued in that role for the next 14 years with National Mutual after the T&amp;G merger.  <br/> <br/> Now 62, I'm a husband, a dad, and a grandfather. I'm also in the unenviable position where I can speak with authority on a fatal car crash in which I received serious life threatening injuries; the result from which I was classed as unemployable at age 42.  <br/> <br/> At the time of the car crash I was married with four daughters (two at private secondary college and one at University), I was a successful agency manager and of course we had a mortgage, leased cars, education commitments etc. etc.  <br/> <br/> On a beautiful Sunday afternoon my working life was taken from me in the most violent of ways when I was involved in a horrific car crash in which an 18 year old girl was killed. Thank heavens the crash wasn't my fault! At that time I didn't know that I was about to face years of rehabilitation and counseling.  <br/> <br/> Four months after the crash my employment was terminated, and soon after that the doctors would tell me that I would never work again. By this time I was already receiving my Income Protection benefits, the regular fortnightly payment that would become our financial lifeblood for the next 16.5 years.  <br/> <br/> With the help of doctors and my family I worked hard at recovering my mental and physical self, only to be dealt the cruelest of blows just thirty months after my car crash, when our youngest daughter Carmen (age 18) was killed in a car crash.  <br/> <br/> My story is a journey and I tell of the Income Protection benefits that my family relied on after it had its livelihood stripped from it when I was just 42 years old. I tell of the heartache of losing Carmen in a car crash, I tell of the fight to become a financial contributor to our household and family again.  <br/> <br/> I have a burning desire to change the thinking of advisers who don't place enough emphasis on risk protection for the client who is relying on their advice. I now know that Income Protection is the most valuable insurance protection for a family when a scenario such as what happened to me strikes down the breadwinner.  <br/> <br/> This presentation is confronting and personal, it's thought provoking and factual and it will do for Income Protection something that has never been done before, it will make advisers and clients alike understand the need to secure the one thing that makes their financial life tick, their income!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Try as I might I just cannot remember the first time I received or sent a text. Or an email.</p><p> But I do remember being a young communications specialist in the navy and looking in wonder at the technology we had at our disposal&hellip;.it was awesome.  We could type messages directly to people right on the other side of the world&hellip;.if they had a telex machine&hellip;and they could receive it within mere minutes.  Who would have thought communication electronically on a one-to-one basis would even be possible at that speed?  You could even send a message to someone in a plane, or a ship! Awesome.</p><h3> Well, at the time it was state of the art. Hard to believe, but true nevertheless.</h3><p> <br/> Some years later and I do remember being quite against the idea of getting a cellphone for a quite a while&hellip;and yet now I&rsquo;d need surgery to remove me from my smartphone.  My oh my, how our attitudes change over time as we become comfortable with new technology, huh?</p><p> These things have been running through my mind as I read a huge number of articles about what is now labelled &ldquo;Robo-Advisers&ldquo;.  The robo&rsquo;s threaten to use automation to replace human expertise and provide real time product and advice solutions directly to consumers.</p><p> &ldquo;Woe is us&rdquo; is the refrain of the moment amongst many financial services professionals.  I am sure that the same lament was heard from farm labourers when the first steam powered machine trundled around a paddock&hellip;.or from scribes when the first commercial printing presses clattered into action.</p><p> &ldquo;Woe is us&rdquo; was the refrain of switchboard operators too. The old switchboard operators are now the fastest growing demographic for new social media accounts, they all have smartphones, and can all &ldquo;text speak&rdquo; with their grandkids. They adapted.</p><p> But this Robo-advice thing, it can&rsquo;t work.  I mean, financial advice is such a personal experience for every consumer.  No machine can ever listen and understand the way humans do.  Doing stuff online is so impersonal and one-dimensional, and just completely lacking in eye contact&hellip;like Online Dating. It will never work because that just can&rsquo;t replicate how humans connect.</p><p> Unfortunately 76% of adult consumers would appear to hold a different view.</p><p> That&rsquo;s awkward.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s just consider the online dating world for a moment.  </h3><p> <br/> A decade ago it was pretty much unthinkable that people would sit at home in their lounge room and look at pictures and bio&rsquo;s of total strangers without getting into trouble with the law.  Frankly it seemed pretty creepy, didn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> But now we find that over three quarters of single adult Americans have tried online dating.  That is a pretty overwhelming indication from a sophisticated consumer-driven society that they are ok with going digital to find happiness and harmony and perhaps a mate-for-life.  Taking charge of the situation and then actively going looking for what you want is actually a trait that we mostly admire in people.  Online dating works.  And the more comfortable people get with any new or different communications medium, the more they use it.  Like texting or Facebook for example.</p><p> Why would we think that these same consumers won&rsquo;t go digital to find a more convenient or cheaper deal on some insurance or a passive strategy mutual fund?</p><p> You better believe they will.  It will take off like Netflix.  Except it will much much bigger.  Maybe even bigger than Facebook.</p><p> A superb infograph courtesy of Swiss Re highlights just how complex the purchase of insurance has become, and an insurance purchase is arguably one of the more sophisticated and difficult financial products to try and purchase.</p><p> <img alt=\"Swiss-Re-study-Big-Data-revolution-1405\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/swiss-re-study-big-data-revolution-1405.jpg?w=610\"/></p><p> How consumers access information has changed forever.  How consumers assess the merit of product solutions is rapidly changing.  How they access, consider and utilise advice is already a blend of technology-based solutions and human interaction.</p><h3> Of course Robo-advice models will work.  </h3><p> <br/> And they will take business from some humans.  Only a few centuries ago scribes had to abandon their trade when printing presses went live and made books available on a (relatively) mass scale instead of being individually crafted works of art available only to the very wealthy.  Not much work is around for scribes these days though.  They should have adapted.</p><p> The same fate awaits those in professional services who fail to acknowledge that we are witnessing a fundamental shift in consumer buying behaviour.  For any professional who wishes to be in business in 5 years time, the question now is not &ldquo;how do I compete with Robo-Advice?&ldquo;, but &ldquo;how do I incorporate a robo-advice offering successfully into my business?&rdquo;</p><p> It isn&rsquo;t a matter of competing head-on with a demand-driven technology solution. That is a war most professionals simply cannot win.  It is a case of working out how to make the demand-driven technology solution work for our clients in a way that still enables us to be the people that educate and coach the right behaviours and strategic choices for them.</p><p> Robo-advice presents us with the classic &ldquo;adapt or die&rdquo; dilemma.  When you look at it that way, adapting and learning to live with it doesn&rsquo;t seem a bad choice.</p><p> Like the Online Dating concept, Robo-Advice solutions will get traction and become a normal everyday choice that consumers try and use.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Given all the material that is out there these days on employee engagement and my unabashed love of acronyms, I started playing around with an A-Z list of words and thoughts tied to this subject.  The first two letters of the alphabet came easily for me since they are things I always talk about.</p><p> <strong>  A stands for Alignment </strong> , which is all about ensuring that employees understand where their company is going, how they will get there and where they fit in.</p><p> <strong>  B stands for Buying In </strong> , which is having employees who truly believes in the mission, vision and purpose of the organization they work for.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s when I got to the letter C that my keyboard stuck and my brain went into overdrive. </strong> I truly believe that as a general rule of thumb, amazing businesses succeed in creating engaged organizations by focusing on these six C&rsquo;s:</p><h3> Collaboration</h3><p> Employees don&rsquo;t just work together; they are vested in each other&rsquo;s success. Collaborative organizations know there is more power in &lsquo;we&rsquo; than &lsquo;I&rsquo;.</p><h3> Creativity</h3><p> Employees are heard and their ideas are valued. Engaged employees are more likely to be innovative and creative.</p><h3> Connection</h3><p> Engaged employees create happy customers who create more sales and ultimately increased revenues and shareholder value. There&rsquo;s no denying the cause and effect of this relationship.</p><h3> Celebration</h3><p> We need to celebrate successes along the way so that employees can feel a sense of accomplishment and recognition. There&rsquo;s nothing better than having a reason to celebrate.</p><h3> Community</h3><p> It&rsquo;s important to forge the connection between employees and the communities in which they live and work by giving back. Here&rsquo;s where your work and personal life can come together in brilliant harmony.</p><p> Saving the most important &lsquo;C&rsquo; for last, let&rsquo;s talk about the one thing that can make or break a company&rsquo;s ability to create a workforce of engaged employees.</p><h3> Context</h3><p> The simple act of providing context for decisions is the most powerful thing a leader can do to foster the right environment where engagement can thrive. Nothing rips at the fabric of trust more than not knowing or understanding why a decision was made. It&rsquo;s okay to share the bad news, but at least let employees know the reason behind it. If you have to announce layoffs, explain the business reason driving that decision. If you are granting employees something positive, like a performance-related bonus, give them the facts behind the decision so they can see how their hard work is paying off with strong results for the company.</p><p> If you remember nothing else from this post, never forget to give people context. It works in your personal life as well. No matter the situation, everyone wants to know the why behind the what. Context helps to provide clarity, direction and meaning as it serves to get everyone aligned on the same page.</p><p> If you ask parents how many times they heard their children respond &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; to a request, the answer will probably be &ldquo;too many times to count.&rdquo; However, if you provide the context beforehand you might be able to lessen the number of whys down the road and head off that headache before it starts.</p><p> Since my keyboard is stuck, I am giving up on the rest of the alphabet for now. I hope these 6 C&rsquo;s become your foundation to creating an environment where passion, performance and productivity come together in an abundance of engagement.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> I love listening to technical analysts talk about the market&mdash;the jargon drips off their tongues like honey off a spoon.</h3><p> <br/> In fact, you can not attend a financial conference without at least one &ldquo;expert&rdquo; providing their best bets, top picks and can&rsquo;t miss prognostications. Of course, each one of those presentations also has a disclaimer that every word uttered can and may be completely wrong. So much for market predictions.</p><p> The best type of analysis happens AFTER an event, like a market correction or recession. Once the dust has settled and the bets have been collected, the so-called experts swoop in to make sense of the whole pile of rubble. We know that there&rsquo;s an entire industry devoted to writing and distributing market newsletters and bulletins. It is surprisingly similar to the guys who tout the odds on football games. Just call 1-888-SCR-WYOU for the guaranteed picks of the week. </p><p> But where would we be without these people filling up panels on the cable shows, writing newsletters or penning content for the web? There&rsquo;d be lots of empty pages and unfilled hours of television&mdash;perish the thought!</p><p> We live in a society that expects&mdash;and even demands&mdash;the so-called experts to stand up and tell the masses the answers. The problem is that while the gurus are counting their cash, the consumer&rsquo;s pockets are being drained by the hopes and dreams that someone will show them the Promised Land. How many years do we have to spend walking in the desert until we get it? The answer is not a quick fix, just add-water, instant pudding solution.</p><h3> The academic community has long proffered their findings on stock picking your way to success.</h3><p> <br/> Nobel Prize Winning Professor Eugene Fama from The University of Chicago presented his argument in the 1960&rsquo;s that financial markets are, in the long run, efficient and that since all information is available for investors to act upon, securities are properly priced. Stock pickers believe they can find the mispricing in the securities market consistently enough to make the smart play. Unfortunately for them, once you add in trading, operating expenses and tax costs, there aren&rsquo;t many opportunities from which to profit. Especially once you factor in the level of risk you&rsquo;re taking on the bet, er-investment.</p><h3> The big idea here is risk.</h3><p> <br/> When you can only focus on the upside of an investment without understanding the downside, then you are falling prey to the rose-colored over-optimistic view that a stock will rise because it found out you just bought it and will naturally respond in kind by skyrocketing to new, unexpected heights. But let&rsquo;s come back to earth for a bit here. Your long-term investment success depends more on getting through the inevitable down years than by scoring big hits during the up years. Those who believe they can pick the right stocks for you and time the market accurately are probably not explaining the degree of risk that you&rsquo;re accepting.</p><p> So when you hear the 10 best bets or top stocks to buy, or funds you absolutely HAVE to own, make sure you read the disclaimer that these are guesses, at best. Make sure you ask about and understand the risks&mdash;the real risks&mdash;meaning whether you will achieve your goals. And by goals, we&rsquo;re not referring to the percentage increase in your portfolio, but your LIFE goals: buying a home, financial security, sending your kids to college, retiring with peace of mind. Yeah, THOSE goals.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;ve been anywhere but on a desert island this past week (and I can only hope that&rsquo;s precisely where you&rsquo;ve been!) you know it&rsquo;s been a wild week for the market, and a wild week of headlines focused on Greece, Puerto Rico, and the resulting market volatility. &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/business/international/daily-stock-market-activity.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   Greece&rsquo;s Debt Crisis Sends Stocks Falling Around the Globe  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; announced the New York Times. &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33311240\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Greecedebt talks: EU chief feels 'betrayed',  </a> </u> &rdquo; according to the BBC. CNBC stated, &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102796220\" target=\"_blank\">  S  <u>   tocks ignored Greece, now pay the price  </u> </a> .&rdquo; On Puerto Rico, the New York Times headline read, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/business/dealbook/puerto-ricos-governor-says-islands-debts-are-not-payable.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Governor Says Island&rsquo;s Debts Are &lsquo;Not Payable&rsquo;  </a> </u> &rdquo; alongside The Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s story, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-rico-releases-report-calling-for-concessions-from-creditors-1435588154\" target=\"_blank\">   Puerto Rico Releases Report Calling For Concessions From Creditors: Report&rsquo;s release sends some Puerto Rico bonds to record lows.  </a> </u> &rdquo; Clearly the world&mdash;and the markets&mdash;are reacting.</p><h3> But should you?</h3><p> <br/> While there were a ton of alarm bells going off in the media Monday, the news that struck me the most was CNN Money announcing the &ldquo; <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/29/investing/stocks-markets-greece-us/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">  worst day for Dow in 2015 </a> .&rdquo; It seemed to hit the core of my thinking&hellip;or at least to beg the question, &ldquo;What does that even mean?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m an investment advisor, and I can tell you this: for long-term, prudent, and informed investors, it shouldn&rsquo;t mean a darned thing. </p><p> <img alt=\"Klein_market-emotions.png\" src=\"https://kleinadvisors.advisorproducts.com/images/easyblog_images/705/Klein_market-emotions.png\"/></p><p> I&rsquo;m seeing something very interesting happening right now that shows my clients and other educated individuals are rising above the&ldquo;cycle of investor emotions&rdquo; that&rsquo;s so common. When the market is up, people pay attention and get excited about the opportunity. When it&rsquo;s down, they get nervous or scared and want to run the other way. What&rsquo;s fascinating right now is that, despite the recent volatility, everyone seems to be talking about investing again&mdash;in my office and everywhere else I look. The fear of the recession seems to be over. Yes, the potential Greek and Puerto Rican defaults are concerns that create uncertainty around the global financial system. But they shouldn&rsquo;t be casting doubt on how good companies and the economy are valued.</p><p> When it comes to investing, it&rsquo;s important to remember that we&rsquo;re investing in the economy in general&mdash;and in the strong companies that support the economy. Looking around me today, I see many very tangible indicators of that strong economy. Everyone I know seems to be headed to Europe this summer. New cars are everywhere. &rdquo;For sale&rdquo; signs seem to turn into &ldquo;sold&rdquo; signs overnight. And it&rsquo;s not just my own perception. Car sales are the highest they&rsquo;ve been since 2001. Housing starts spiked more than 20% last month&mdash;the biggest increase since 2007. In reality, the US economy is going strong. And the fact that  <u>  <a href=\"http://rt.com/usa/269830-millenials-baby-boomers-population/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   millennials have finally outnumbered baby boomers  </a>    </u> for the first time in history can only help sustain the momentum. More than 80 million millennials are exploding the population, and they&rsquo;re buying everything. Houses. Cars. Computers. Washing machines. Dinners out. You name it, the single biggest generation in history is buying it today or planning to buy it tomorrow.</p><h3> Yes, the headlines are right.</h3><p> <br/> Greece and Puerto Rico default fears wreaked havoc on the markets this week. But beyond the headlines, when you invest for the long term, the trend is always up. Way up.</p><p> <img alt=\"b2ap3_thumbnail_DJIA.png\" src=\"https://kleinadvisors.advisorproducts.com/images/easyblog_images/705/b2ap3_thumbnail_DJIA.png\"/></p><p> Dow Jones Industrial Average: 1900-present</p><p> So, if you can, forget about Greece (except perhaps as a vacation destination). The market has been anticipating this default for years, so this &ldquo;news&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t be a driver over the long term. Forget about Puerto Rico&hellip;that default has been assumed for a very long time (one reason why our bond funds don&rsquo;t hold any Puerto Rican debt). Forget about the media (except for infotainment), forget about the headlines, and focus on the economy. Less than five months ago, the headlines were shouting the news that the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2015/02/13/dow-returns-to-18000-as-sp-500-hits-new-high/\" target=\"_blank\">   S&amp;P 500 hit a new high  </a> </u>  and clients were coming to me ready to invest&mdash;or re-invest&mdash;in the market. The informed investor rises above the cycle of investor emotions and continues to stay the course. Today, the market has settled down, though all bets are off if Greece does actually default this week or next. No matter how the markets react to the situation, my advice is to remember Warren Buffet&rsquo;s words of wisdom: \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\"</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Does your firm face the standard insurance industry problem that only 10 to 15% of the advisors and agents who start in the business are still with them after 5 years? </strong> Then, of those who stay after 5 years, how many are strongly committed to your firm? Or, are they producing at the desired rate?</p><p> Meeting this challenge starts with improving how the home office uniquely manages each advisor in the field. Then, it is about helping the field force be more successful in engaging their clients (policy holders).</p><p> In recent times, we have been helping some of the world&rsquo;s leading insurance firms significantly boost the levels of field force engagement, thereby leading to more profitable business relationships. Our approach has been to help these insurance firms embrace behavioral marketing and talent segmentation strategies based on validated behavioral science insights. These strategies start by discovering the unique communication and learning style of each person in their field force enabling the firm can more deeply connect with them and provide greater sales assistance.</p><p> <strong>  Being specific, by segmenting each person into one of 4 primary communication styles we have helped these leading insurance firms to: </strong></p><p> 1.  Create customized marketing plans which re-frame the key messages for each advisor in the field force</p><p> 2.  Provide tailored sales programs and presentations for each advisor based on their style so that they can then adapt to the style of each prospect and customer</p><p> 3.  Match the talents and communication style of each advisor to their ideal clients to improve the chances of deeper levels of connection with less energy</p><p> 4.  Align advisors to the types of insurance product solutions that they would optimally sell based on their specific behavioral talents</p><p> 5.  Help advisors to form teams with other advisors who have different talents so that they can capitalize on more opportunities as a collective unit</p><p> 6.  Build online communities for advisors and clients to meet, and be continuously educated</p><p> 7.  Develop hiring and retention metrics to ensure that the best talent is retained and resourced for success</p>",

But shouldn&rsquo;t brands want everyone to like them? Isn&rsquo;t that the point of branding, or is there some other marketing strategy at work?</p><p> Six Degrees Account Director Mercedes Cimino reviews how some brands have alienated large market segments in favor of targeting a more profitable customer group. From the GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial to Heroin Skateboards to outdoor adventure sport retailer Eastern Mountain Sports, Mercedes discusses tactics these brands have employed for reaching their target audiences, and how and why those strategies might change over time.</p><h3> Key take-aways:</h3><p> <br/> 1: Understand that no brand can &ndash; or should &ndash; try to be all things to all people.</p><p> 2: Be true to who you are and don&rsquo;t be afraid to alienate some in the process.</p><p> 3: Know your target audience and market potential.</p><p> 4: It&rsquo;s natural to think that a broader target market would yield higher revenue, but you risk watering down the brand if you don&rsquo;t have a differentiated position with that audience.</p><p> 5: Follow a consistent brand strategy until the market indicates that it&rsquo;s time to adapt.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Amazon is a billion-dollar juggernaut, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way for their customers. We&rsquo;re going to take a look at how they bring their  <u>  brand </u>  promise and corporate ethos to life, how they make it real for their customers, and the challenges they face in the future.</p><h3> A world that revolves around the customer</h3><p> <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239364011\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Amazon mission  </a> </u>  is simple. They want &ldquo;to be Earth&rsquo;s most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online, and&hellip;offer&hellip;the lowest possible prices.&rdquo; And while the mission is simple, offering anything a consumer might want to buy online is certainly not. Warehouses, purchasing, fulfillment, inventory and millions of moving parts are conspiring to add complexity to the experience.</p><p> That&rsquo;s what makes Amazon great. They&rsquo;ve focused on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3002101/simplicity-most-powerful-branding-principle\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the purchase experience  </a> </u> , even going so far as to brand theirs as &ldquo;1-click ordering.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;ve shopped on Amazon, you likely take the 1-click ordering experience for granted, and that&rsquo;s exactly what they want you to do. Think about how complicated the process is to get that thing you see on your internet browser into your hands. Now, forget that whole process and click one button. Simply magic.</p><p> They&rsquo;ve taken the most tedious part out of internet shopping and streamlined it. They&rsquo;ve exponentially shortened the distance between wanting something and buying it. No fields to fill out, no information to enter, just a single click and you&rsquo;ve gone from shopping to buying.</p><h3> Simplify for the customer</h3><p> <br/> This may seem intuitive, but in fact, it runs contrary to the strategy many internet sites follow.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223125\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Amazon saves you time  </a> </u>  by recommending the things you&rsquo;re likely to enjoy and getting you done faster in an industry that&rsquo;s built on keeping you on a page as long as possible. They are customer-centric at the core, going to incredible lengths to simplify a complicated process.</p><p> That said, there might be trouble brewing. Amazon&rsquo;s Prime membership was the company&rsquo;s effort to increase purchase size and one of the best parts of the company offering. It was beloved by customers. Unfortunately,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/business/2014/02/amazon-prime-good-true/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   it&rsquo;s about to get more expensive  </a> </u> . The company expects to raise their price on Amazon Prime by $20 to $40 to cover increased shipping costs. What will that do for the company&rsquo;s simplified shopping experience? Our guess is not much.</p><h3> The value of speedy shipping</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re the kind of customer who&rsquo;s used to &ldquo;free&rdquo; 2- day shipping, an additional $20 &ndash; $40 likely won&rsquo;t break the bank. If you&rsquo;re a new customer and it&rsquo;s enough to dissuade you, you might not be the kind of customer Amazon wants.</p><p> Stop for a second and think about the most tedious part of your shopping experience. Whether it&rsquo;s waiting on bids, checking out, or just picking a color, we&rsquo;d bet there&rsquo;s something your customers would like to see simplified. Now, think about how you can make that process more consumer-centric.</p>",

    "content": "potential buyers. Despite the fact that your advisor will have provided a comprehensive financial and operational picture of your company in the book, buyers will want to hear the story directly from you. However, most experienced buyers should be willing to limit their review at this stage to a review of the book, discussions with your advisor, and a single call with you.</p><h3> Initial Pricing?</h3><p> <br/> While some advisors might disagree, I generally do not price deals at this stage. Providing a price early assumes that you and your advisor understand the entire value that your company has to every buyer. Also, it assumes that every buyer will value your company at the same level. Both of these assumptions are unrealistic.</p><p> Instead of pricing a deal, your advisor (and you) should be conveying your company&rsquo;s value propositions to potential buyers so that they can make their own decisions on the price they are willing to pay. While your company provides obvious benefits (products, revenue, etc.), there are often synergies that might be available to potential acquirers. Are there purchasing benefits? Cross-selling opportunities? Other synergies? These value propositions can increase a deal price greatly, but can&rsquo;t always be anticipated. My best advice is to remain flexible and to listen to potential targets&rsquo; needs.</p><h3> Indications of Interest</h3><p> <br/> At the end of the first round of discussions (which can last for a month or two), you&rsquo;ll want to separate the lookie loos from the serious buyers. I prefer to do this by requiring non-binding indications of interest. Indications of interest are usually one to three page letters introducing the buyer, describing its interest in your company, and setting out general valuation and deal parameters.</p><p> Frankly, indications of interest have virtually no real meaning, except that they require buyers to put in a little bit of work thinking about the company and its value. Consequently, they are a good way to separate the wheat from the chaff and decide who to include in a more thorough second round of discussions.</p><p> Your M&amp;A advisor should analyze the indications of interest and make recommendations as to how many and which potential buyers to go forward with. I generally advise clients that four to six targets at this stage is a manageable number and usually allows a fair sampling of appropriate financial and strategic buyers, without overwhelming you at the next stage.</p>",

    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s business conference time once again with many firms hosting their large summer meetings. Do the meetings typically present you with ideas to improve your business, increase revenue, or create efficiencies?</p><p> Most meetings actually do bring many ideas that will help improve your business. The key is having a plan to get them home with you and get them implemented. Oftentimes, we return to the office with good intentions to get new initiatives started, but we immediately are immersed in the day-to-day activities so anything new takes a back burner position.</p><p> You are paying for the plane ticket, the hotel and, moreover, the time out of the office when you attend meetings. This year, develop a plan of action in advance for implementing the best one or two ideas fully upon your return.</p><p> Here is a 3 step (very simple) plan for maximizing ideas by turning them into successes for you.</p><h3> 1: Have a plan before you leave</h3><p> <br/> Schedule a meeting for the week you return from the meeting with your whole staff. Let them know what this meeting will be about and why you are holding it. Tell them you won&rsquo;t be reiterating the meeting for them, but going over the best few ideas to get their feedback. Let them know that together the team will put a plan of action in place for implementation and accountability.</p><h3> 2: Use an action plan</h3><p> <br/> While you are attending the meeting, carry with you a blank To-Do List where you can take the ideas and transform them immediately onto an actionable checklist. Each To-Do will have a date it should start and finish, a description of the activity, and who will be responsible. Pull out the actionable items while you are in the meetings so you don&rsquo;t have to go back to your pages of notes to find and decipher.</p><h3> 3: Make your staff part of the process</h3><p> <br/> Meet with your staff when you return to go over the ideas you picked up, get their feedback, prioritize them with your staff, and determine who will take the lead on each activity. Then meet weekly for a few minutes moving forward to discuss progress.</p><p> If you want change in your business, the best places to pick up ideas are at your industry educational conferences. The key is taking the best ideas and putting them to work for you. Good luck!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Susan Deakins | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pennmutual\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Penn Mutual  </u> </a></p><p> I recently had the pleasure of participating on a panel at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sju.edu/int/academics/hsb/resources/rmi/womenininsurance/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Women in Insurance&rdquo; symposium  </a> </u> , presented by the Academy of Risk Management and Insurance at Saint Joseph&rsquo;s University. The panel brought together senior women professionals in the insurance industry to talk about their careers, obstacles, and successes. Over 150 people (including a number of men) were in the audience.</p><p> We didn&rsquo;t address the big &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.pennmutual.com/glass-ceiling/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   glass ceiling  </a> </u> &rdquo; issues of getting women on Boards and into the C Suite. The focus, rather, was a sharing of stories by successful women working in different segments of the insurance industry, how they achieved success, the challenges they faced, and the advice they had for women starting out in their own careers.</p><p> It was a wide-ranging discussion, but I came away with a list of eight lessons learned, culled from the comments made by both panelists and the audience. They say there is wisdom in crowds, and I hope you find these suggestions useful, even if you are neither a woman nor working in the insurance industry.</p><p> <strong>  1. Build your network inside your company. </strong>  It&rsquo;s easy and it&rsquo;s comfortable to &ldquo;just keep your head down and do your job,&rdquo; but that won&rsquo;t necessarily position you for career advancement. Get to know people outside of your department. Having a network throughout the company can help you do your current job better, and it might open doors you never expected.</p><p> <strong>  2. Build your network in your industry and the wider community. </strong>  Financial professionals tend to be more introverted, so it may be uncomfortable to attend networking events, but all the panelists stressed the importance of getting out and getting involved. If it makes you uncomfortable to press the flesh in a large group setting, then volunteer to be on the board of your local industry association. That way, people not only get to know you, they get to see how you work.</p><p> <strong>  3. Technical skills are important, but it&rsquo;s the people skills that make the difference. </strong>  Technical skills probably figure most prominently at the beginning of your career, but, as you take on more responsibility, success will depend more on being able to motivate or guide others in achieving group goals.</p><p> <strong>  4. Make yourself visible. </strong>  If you don&rsquo;t get noticed, you won&rsquo;t get promoted. Prove yourself on various projects or various avenues with other folks, so that when your name comes up on for promotion, people have worked with you and they have an opinion.</p><p> <strong>  5. Believe in yourself. </strong>  Have the self-confidence to believe in yourself and take risks when the opportunity arises, something that&rsquo;s out of your comfort zone. There were a number of stories shared by women who tried something a little bit different and, looking back, they said it was the best career move they ever made.</p><p> <strong>  6. Surround yourself with good support at home. </strong>  This is especially important for women with young children. Support at home is critical. What are the most important things for you to do yourself, and what things can be left for others to do? Find somebody to clean your house, for example.</p><p> Childcare is another area where good support is essential. Develop a network of relatives, friends, or daycare providers you can rely on and who can step in on childcare when needed.</p><p> <strong>  7. Surround yourself with good support at work. </strong>  Along those same lines, your work environment should support you as well. With technology today, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to work from home, so if you have to go to a doctor&rsquo;s appointment or to an event at school, you don&rsquo;t have to take the whole day off. Companies are realizing that this can make for a more productive work environment, but not every company is so supportive.</p><p> A number of the panelists, working for larger companies, shared that often the issue isn&rsquo;t the company but rather the immediate leader. Sometimes it&rsquo;s worthwhile having a conversation with your leader, but sometimes you may simply have to move within the company to a setting that is more supportive of your needs.</p><p> <strong>  8. Having a mentor is important, but it&rsquo;s got to be the right connection. </strong>  There was a lot of talk about whether the panelists had a mentor. We discussed the pros and cons having male or female mentors, although the general consensus offered that gender didn&rsquo;t matter. For several panelists, they didn&rsquo;t necessarily have a mentor, but their immediate leader had been instrumental in a key period in of their career. If you have that right leader, he or she really can provide you with career guidance and coaching that we come to associate with mentors. Most people felt that it wasn&rsquo;t necessary to establish a formal mentor relationship, that is was better to let it happen more organically.</p><p> We spoke as well on whether the workplace has become more supportive of women over the past 20 years. The general consensus was that there had been changes for the better, but it was amazing how much the same questions were still coming up: How do I ask to work from home? How do I ask for a part-time schedule? What&rsquo;s the perception going to be if I ask for that?</p><p> For me &mdash; and I feel very strongly about this &mdash; everybody has to do what&rsquo;s right for them, whether it&rsquo;s working part-time, working full-time, taking time off, or whatever. You can&rsquo;t judge other people&rsquo;s choices. You need to do what&rsquo;s right for you.</p><p> In summary, I think there were two key things I took away from the symposium. First, build your network and make yourself visible. Second, take responsibility for making sure you&rsquo;re in the right environment. Reshape it to your needs, or move on if a different company or opportunity can provide a more supportive environment.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Most likely you have no problem asking for another cup of coffee or for a friend to go to a show with you. But for some reason people freeze up upon even contemplating the idea of having to negotiate, and most will either walk away or take a deal that they know isn&rsquo;t fair.</p><h3> Yes or No</h3><p> <br/> The point to remember is, that the other party always has the opportunity to either, say, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s guess what the reply may actually be.  Yes or no provides you with a 50% chance of getting what you desire. But, just as with a sale, when you add a couple of added options to be selected, the odds in your favor increase.</p><p> This week several people told me that it was incomprehensible to ask a seller to discount the sale price of a condominium due to walls not being properly repaired. In fact, the real estate agent was completely against the asking of this request.  He said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just isn&rsquo;t done here&rdquo;.  In  conversation, my reply was that the owners did a cheap quick fix to sell the property, but anyone can see it needs to be redone. Upon sharing the dilemma, with others, everyone advised the purchase would be lost.</p><h3> Weight Pros and Cons</h3><p> <br/> But when real estate is purchased there are always pros and cons.  If this one fell through there would be others available.  Once again, I advised the real estate agent that the sellers can always say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The end result was they actually said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to crediting the requested amount, making the buyers very happy.</p><p> Fast-forward to job offers, are you satisfied with the salary, vacation time and/or benefits?  Most likely something will be missing, and it&rsquo;s your duty to ask.  By the time the process moves so far forward, the last thing the hiring company wants to do is to go through the process all over again.</p><h3> Focus on Essentials</h3><p> <br/> Comparing this experience to finalizing sales, as long as you pay keen attention to the details requested of you, and you explained the improvement the business will see by employing your services, the buyer will be far more likely to also say &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p> The key to negotiation is to not be emotionally attached.  It can be stressful in the waiting stage, but most often when the process is done in a friendly manner and your perspective is presented clearly, most often you will succeed.</p>",

It became painfully obvious to me when I began this email seeking advice from an unfamiliar, outside source.</p><p> Most of us have hit a wall like that.  We all have times in our careers where we feel stuck, lack confidence, or wonder why no one sees things our way.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve ever felt even a third of what Guy&rsquo;s feeling, it&rsquo;s easy to have similar sentiments like &ldquo;Maybe I should just give up.&rdquo;</p><p> When it gets that bad, the co-author of our upcoming book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://trailblazeinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   David Dye  </a> </u> , and I encourage you to start with three words.</p><p> &ldquo;How Can I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  With those three words you: </strong></p><li> Return focus to your own power and ability to act</li><li> Tap into the energy of your prefrontal cortex&ndash;the part of your brain that problem-solves and plans</li><li> Vastly increase the odds of finding a solution</li><li> Take responsibility and ownership for the one thing you can control&ndash;yourself. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s try some &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; questions with Guy&rsquo;s scene. </strong></p><li> How can I better understand this employee&rsquo;s resistance?</li><li> How can I get more input and feedback from my team?</li><li> How can I set clearer expectations?</li><li> How can I build deeper trust with my boss? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  or maybe even&hellip; </strong></p><li> How can I find a job that doesn&rsquo;t make me so frustrated? <br/>  </li><p> When you ask &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; you might honestly respond with &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s okay. Try David&rsquo;s bonus question,  &ldquo; <u>  What might I do if I did know? </u> &rdquo;</p><p> Now watch what happens. It&rsquo;s amazing how you can generate ideas when you give yourself permission.</p><p> Sometimes you&rsquo;ll realize that you don&rsquo;t have the information you need in order to craft solutions. Then the question becomes, &ldquo;How can I get the information?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Stuck sucks. But you can and will get through it. Start with the simple question, &ldquo;How do I?&rdquo; Then move to an even more powerful question, &ldquo;How do we?&rdquo; </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/author/kpiechule/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Karyn Piechule  </a> </u></p><p> If you are a regular on the financial industry conference circuit, you can&rsquo;t escape the robo-advisor panel discussions, keynotes and exhibit hall scuttlebutt.  Everyone wants to be in the know and discern whether or not the rise of the robo is a threat to their business prospects or an opportunity to seize.</p><p> After attending Morningstar&rsquo;s annual conference in Chicago, it&rsquo;s clear that the conference organizers got the memo: robo talk will draw a crowd. Recently,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102791705\" target=\"_blank\">   a report by A.T. Kearney  </a> </u>  showed that while only 3 percent of respondents use a robo service, almost 70 percent reported having a strong interest in the alternative planning space &ndash; a significant statistic highlighting growth potential in this arena.</p><p> While some advisors may look at the robo space as a competitive threat, there is a strong argument that the related opportunities should be embraced and considered as advisors look to adapt their business models. Below, we outline a few tips for RIAs that are interested in incorporating some varying level of robo service into their practice.</p><p> <strong>  1. Recognize the different levels of service. </strong>  The beauty of integrating a robo service into a business model is that the digital arm can serve (and manage) a scalable group of prospects and clients. The millennial and Gen X generation are a rising target niche that advisors are trying to attract, given the aging baby boomers and the potential for wealth transfer over the next few decades. With these prospects in mind, offering a digital service at a lower cost can help to attract and retain these groups who will only age and attain more wealth over their lifetime. Robo services can be just one arm of your overall business, but if employed correctly, can be a valuable tool to help attract more clients at a lower price point that may go on to then require a higher level of traditional services.</p><p> <strong>  2. You don&rsquo;t have to be a software engineer, just vet one properly.  </strong> The idea of launching a robo arm of your business can seem daunting, however, there are a handful of businesses (Oranj, Jemstep, etc.) that develop the actual software that you and your client will inevitably use. When vetting such firms, evaluate your current business, goals that you want to accomplish by incorporating a digital platform, and the experience/feel that you ideally want to offer. Align yourself with a program provider that can adapt to these objectives.</p><p> <strong>  3. With increased mobility comes increased need for cybersecurity. </strong>  As tech usage in the advisor industry continues to proliferate, so does the risk of cybersecurity threats. A  <a href=\"http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Digital-Investors-Say-Show-Money-on-Mobile/1012577\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  poll commissioned by E*TRADE </a>  shows that 49 percent of investors with at least $10,000 in an online brokerage account use their smartphones to access an investing app weekly. Of that 49 percent, over half access their account at least daily. The same can be said for advisors. According to  <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/news/technology/tech-survey-2015-whats-new-now-2691255-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Financial Planning&rsquo;s Tech Survey 2014 </a> , 66 percent of advisors use a tablet to conduct business.Taking the appropriate preventative cybersecurity measures to protect clients&rsquo; assets and personal information falls under the fiduciary responsibilities of an advisor. But advisors need to take it a step further than purchasing anti-theft software. During a breakout session at this year&rsquo;s Morningstar Investment Conference, Blane Warrene of QuonWarrene noted that cybersecurity isn&rsquo;t just about tech but also about behavioral concerns, such as:</p><li> Using one password for multiple accounts</li><li> Using free Wi-Fi over unsecured networks</li><li> Sharing devices on a network</li><li> Being &ldquo;too social&rdquo; on social media <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Advisors would be wise to develop educational materials for clients that help them understand the risks of accessing their accounts on mobile devices. </strong></p><p> <strong>  4. Let the world know.  </strong> You&rsquo;ve embraced and adapted cutting edge technology, upgraded security measures, and are ready to roll out the product. As an early adopter, you have the advantage of establishing yourself as an industry thought leader. Take the next step and use tools that reach your tech savvy audience the way they want to be met. Developing a company blog serves as a great platform for sharing investing insights and reactions to the latest market news. Setting up and maintaining active social media accounts is another great way to get in front of potential clients and share blog content or media coverage. This is how the new generation of investors is communicating. If you want to get their attention, take advantage of the technology that they are already using.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/the-invasion-of-the-robo-advisor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Advisors shouldn&rsquo;t look at the robo trend as a threat  </a> </u> , but as an opportunity to get an early foot in the door with young investors. Employing new technology should be a component of the strategic plan for future growth and sustainability. It&rsquo;s a proactive approach to preparing for the inevitable attrition of aging clientele as they start to draw down assets in retirement and pass on their wealth to future generations.</p><p> Note: This post is a collaboration between Karyn and another member of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  team, Freddy Martino.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I met a client at his office a few months back. He was full of ideas. He was going to grow the business in a myriad of ways. He would use technology to turbo charge productivity. He would invest in sales training to make the client experience flawless. He would nail his pricing for once and for all, to make sure the business was completely profitable. Energy flowed with every word. His ambition was infectious.</p><h3> The only obstacle is none of those initiatives would make the slightest difference until he solved his biggest problem; self-management.</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes I&rsquo;ve been in to undertake the initial analysis that begins any coaching work I do with a business. Together, we look at the business from all important angles, seeking to find the blocks that might stop/ be stopping the business from growing.</p><p> Sometimes the blocks are small, no more than 2mm adjustments left or right. Often (so often!) it comes down to the way that the people in the business are working together or, to be more accurate, how they are not working together.</p><p> We live in a world of distraction. For all the benefits of technology and the communications revolution, it&rsquo;s harder than ever before to isolate ourselves from the digital noise of life. The problem is; to produce great work, weHAVE to isolate ourselves just to be able to think clearly.</p><p> Many sports fans will be familiar with the concept of flow. Some also know it as &ldquo;being in the Zone&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s that state of unconscious competence that occurs when suddenly you find yourself sinking every basket, making every pass or hitting every shot without thinking.</p><p> It happens in work too. It&rsquo;s those moments when you find yourself nailing every client appointment, chewing through strategy planning at double speed or smashing out an SOA in half the usual time.</p><p> Thing is though flow isn&rsquo;t something that just happens. It takes time &ndash; around 30-40 mins on a average &ndash; to reach that state of complete focus. And if something interrupts you in that period? It&rsquo;s back to the beginning, which is why you sometimes have those days where it feels like nothing of any substance has gotten done.</p><p> This is important stuff! If you&rsquo;re going to grow a business quickly, you need to be able to think, analyse and strategise with an uncluttered mind. The reality for most business owners is they have unknowingly created the exact working environment that will make sure they and their employees can&rsquo;t do that.</p><h3> Thankfully, a few mindful adjustments can make the difference</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Structure your week &ndash; </strong> There is no way in a month of Sunday&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re going to manage your business if you can&rsquo;t plan for what&rsquo;s happening from day to day. Not having a structure to the working week is like putting random ingredients in a pot at random times and expecting a gourmet stew. Instead, set aside time on a Monday for the team to come together and plan the week, and time on a Friday for debrief. Work out which days are client-days and which are for working on the business. Then stick to it at least 80% of the time and watch productivity soar.</p><p> <strong>  2. Adopt a system of non-distraction &ndash; </strong> Open plan offices are the Devils&rsquo; gift to focus, giving license for interruption far too easily. Whilst social engagement is hugely important in a working environment (and I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest going back to cubicle nation for a second!), everything has a place. Establish guidelines around when someone can be interrupted and when they can&rsquo;t. Using a &ldquo;do-not-disturb&rdquo; flag or some other marker can work well. Even better, have one or more areas of the office set aside as areas where people can go where they need solace to work</p><p> <strong>  3. Remove temptation altogether &ndash; </strong> I do all my business planning sessions offsite. Firstly because it gets people outside their comfort zones, but secondly because it takes them away from all those office distractions that are so easy to get drawn back into. Frankly, when it&rsquo;s a big important piece of work, getting well away from the office is a strategy that gets results.</p><p> <strong>  4. Manage your diaries &ndash; </strong> If something needs to get done, book out time in your diary as you would any other appointment. Simply speaking, if you don&rsquo;t commit time to a specific action that needs doing, it&rsquo;s very unlikely it&rsquo;ll happen. Seeing as most of us &ldquo;live&rdquo; in our diaries from a work perspective these days, it&rsquo;s the most effective way to manage it.</p><p> <strong>  5. Find out where you spend your time &ndash; </strong> Sometimes there are those times when you just can&rsquo;t work out where time has gone. If this is the case, it&rsquo;s time for some deeper analysis. Apps like  <a href=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  RescueTime </a> ,  <a href=\"http://www.timedoctor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Time Doctor </a>  or <a href=\"http://www.hourstimetracking.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hours </a>  will analyse where you or your team are REALLY spending your time. Plus, when it comes to doing your pricing, you&rsquo;ll have a truly accurate picture of how long things take.</p>",

    "link": "how-stress-causes-ignorance",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> We all know the effects and ways of how stress causes ignorance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so stressed, I can&rsquo;t take it anymore!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why am I so stressed?!&rdquo; &ldquo;This stress is killing me!&rdquo; Any of these exclamations sound familiar? Today&rsquo;s business environment is saturated with &ldquo;little yipping Chihuahuas&rdquo;: financial concerns, too much work, job dissatisfaction, marketplace pressure, time and soul sucking meetings, information overload and a host of other issues, which is why &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stressed&rdquo; is probably one of the most commonly used and most relatable two words we have in our vocabulary.</p><p> Boy do I know it well, as I&rsquo;m sure you do too. In fact, the day I started Chapter 3, a chapter about stress, for my most recent book, &ldquo;What Keeps Leaders Up At Night&rdquo;, my neighbor started construction on her house. When I say &ldquo;construction,&rdquo; I mean a complete demolition that started at 5AM and continued well into the night with the rudest and loudest contractors I have ever had exposure to. The noise was unrelenting. I was writing my book from a barstool at my kitchen counter and after a week, I was living in a state of chronic agitation, not sleeping well at night, anticipating being awoken by a jackhammer that would feel like it was inside my brain. My concentration and thinking were so shot that I couldn&rsquo;t write and of course, the deadline was always looming. I probably should have gone elsewhere to work, but I couldn&rsquo;t think clearly. I was mired in a state of stress-induced stupidity. My state of existence became a stream of fragmented grunts and groans. I lacked the wherewithal to change the situation, to think, &ldquo;Go to a coffee shop or your office, Nicole.&rdquo;</p><h3> Prolonged Stress Can Cause Stupidity</h3><p> <br/> Prolonged, chronic stress causes ignorance oftenly. Though our brains are capable of dealing with sudden acute stress, they don&rsquo;t fare so well with chronic stress, i.e. the endless little yipping Chihuahuas that prompt what psychologists call the long-term fight/flight response.Our stress response triggers hormone secretion like cortisol, the hormone that makes our bellies stick out a little further than we often would like. The perceptions of a given threat determine the type and amount of hormones the endocrine system will dispense.</p><p> The steady attack of personal and professional obligations and deadlines, the overload of emails, texts and other technology making us constantly accessible, and everything else that demands our attention in the measly 24 hours that we are given in a day build up a chemical cocktail that keeps our bodies in a constant state of agitation, impairing memory, thinking and learning.  Left unnoticed or ignored, this condition increases the odds that you will end up with serious mental and/or physical health problems, or in my case, pure stupidity.</p><h3> Stupidity caused by stress is basically a bad case of the interaction between:</h3><li> What you think of the stressor</li><li> How you think you can cope with the stressor <br/>  </li><p> Perception, in a way, is everything because these thoughts trigger the biochemical response. When noise pollution from jackhammers or yipping Chihuahuas has you stuck on your barstool at your kitchen counter instead of sitting with a laptop and a cup of coffee at a quiet coffee shop, it&rsquo;s time for a perspective shift from duh to do.  Many factors figure into a particular person&rsquo;s response, such as their tendency toward pessimism or optimism, their perception of control over a situation, and their degree of hardiness and resilience to name a few.</p><p> I consider myself a relatively hardy and resilient lady but I was stuck in a state of pessimism and felt really out of control because I couldn&rsquo;t think straight. My self-awareness was shot. I couldn&rsquo;t formulate the questions, &ldquo;How is this event threatening me?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How am I coping with the event?&rdquo; because I perceived I was trapped. In hindsight, my answers to these questions would have been &ldquo;It&rsquo;s driving me crazy!&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coping like an idiot because I&rsquo;m not doing anything.&rdquo; Figuring out what I could control (my response and my actions) and what I couldn&rsquo;t control (contractors and their schedule) would have forced me to shift perspectives earlier than I actually did. Truly a great exercise in any situation because guess what: you can&rsquo;t control most events in life, but you can certainly control reaction to them.</p><p> The shift in perspective came several weeks later when I awoke, startled by the sound of a circular saw cutting its way through a piece of wood. I went about my same routine of trying to write with a bad case of &ldquo;in the house&rdquo; road rage, poking the letters on my keyboard and typing out curse words over and over again. Still in my pajamas, I threw on a pair of boots, grabbed my jacket and ran out of the house into my car and found myself at a Best Buy 5 minutes later, uncharacteristically throwing down a hefty sum for the best pair of noise-canceling ear phones on the market. I came back home, plugged the headphones into my computer, and found a website that broadcasted white noise.</p><p> We will not discuss what happened a few days later in my super productive, noise-cancelling state when I didn&rsquo;t hear my friend key into my house after apparently knocking on the door and figuring I wasn&rsquo;t home. That&rsquo;s a different story about the wonders of the acute stress response versus the prolonged stress response and how sore your body feels several hours later, once the adrenaline wears off and your body stabilizes, from jerking yourself off of the barstool in total fear and tripping over the chair onto the floor because your feet were still entwined on the footrest, as your noise cancelling headphones and computer going flying across the room.</p><h3> The Moral of this Story?</h3><p> <br/> Stress is pretty much a given in our business lives and for many of us, in our personal lives. But the stress response is negotiable.We can survive the fact that stress causes ignorance by utilizing a healthy dose of stress to motivate us to respond effectively to challenging situations and get the job done. In fact, the right response to stress has kept the human race alive for millennia. It sends a signal that you must do something to deal with the situation. Implementing the right response leads to survival, success, better health, brain function, and in some cases reduced stupidity.</p><p> Are you stressed?  <a href=\"http://playbook.amanet.org/ama-quiz-am-i-stressed/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Take the quiz  </u>  . </a></p>",

If you owe the bank $100 million, that&rsquo;s the bank&rsquo;s problem.&rdquo;</h3>And when the amount is $1.73 billion, it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s problem. Greece is officially in arrears for missing its scheduled payment Tuesday to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Expecting this, American stocks had their largest one-day drop of 2015 on Monday. Market volatility, as measured by the VIX, spiked sharply.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Volatility-Spikes-on-Greek-Fears-07012015-LG.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Volatility Spikes on Greek Fears\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Volatility-Spikes-on-Greek-Fears-07012015.gif\"/> <u>  click to enlarge </u></a>Investors responded by seeking safe-haven investments such as Treasuries, gold and municipal bonds.This Sunday, Greece plans to vote on whether to comply with their creditors&rsquo; present conditions or to reject the terms, a choice some think could lead to a so-called Grexit from the eurozone. Currently, there&rsquo;s no such exit clause written into the legal fabric of the currency system other than leaving the entire European Union, an extreme &ldquo;solution.&rdquo; No matter how this particular act plays out, there are still more (and even larger) loan payments waiting in the wings, the next one owed to the European Central Bank (ECB) and totaling nearly $4 billion.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country holds the greatest total amount of Greek debt, officially refused to renegotiate the bailout terms until after the referendum.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-05-01/COMM-Which-Countries-Would-Suffer-Most-if-Greece-Defaulted-on-Debt-05012015-LG.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Which Countries Would Suffer the Most If Greece Defaulted on Its Debt\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-05-01/COMM-Which-Countries-Would-Suffer-Most-if-Greece-Defaulted-on-Debt-05012015.gif\"/> <u>  click to enlarge </u></a>In many ways, the unfolding Greek drama is playing out like a sequel to the Cyprus banking crisis two years ago, which also had far-reaching ripple effects in world markets. But the present situation could potentially have much larger ramifications.<h3> How Cyprus Prevented Capital Flight and Saved Its Economy</h3>Cyprus has climbed most of the way out of its financial hole after making bad loans to&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you know it?&mdash;Greece, following the 2008 crisis. One of the ways the Cypriot government managed to do this was by implementing capital controls. Cyprus imposed restrictions on how many euros could be withdrawn per day or taken out of the country, and ATMs rationed cash.Similar capital controls are now in place in Greece. Banks are closed until at least next Monday&mdash;the day after the referendum&mdash;and no more than 60 euros may be withdrawn from ATMs per day, per account. Greeks traveling abroad also face restrictions. Even parents who have children studying abroad will need to apply for permission to send them money. These inconveniences are forcing citizens to realize the possible, and potentially very unpleasant, consequences of a no vote in the upcoming referendum.One opinion poll right now shows that a slim majority of Greek respondents are in favor of working out a deal with the IMF and other lenders. Former Cypriot Minister of Finance <a href=\"https://glineq.blogspot.com/2015/06/former-finance-minister-of-cyprus-on.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Michael Sarris</a>&mdash;who&rsquo;s had plenty of experience with debt negotiations&mdash;agrees. He urges Greece to vote yes, stating that to do so &ldquo;takes [them] back to the negotiating table with the chance of a better outcome.&rdquo;Among the Greek voters, of course, are pensioners and low-income Greeks who receive government benefits. Fed up with austerity, such voters seem much more likely to vote no. But this way of thinking is precisely what landed Greece in its current situation to begin with. For years the country has been financing its ever-expanding budget with loans from European banks and the IMF, with no plan in place on how to repay them. In fact, Greece has spent 90 of the last 192 years in one financial crisis or another, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Greece-has-spent-90-of-the-past-192-years-in-financial-crisis-07012015-LG.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Greece Has Spent 90 of the Past 192 Years in Financial Crisis\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Greece-has-spent-90-of-the-past-192-years-in-financial-crisis-07012015.gif\"/> <u>  click to enlarge </u></a>For this reason and more, MSCI, global index provider, is seriously considering demoting Greece from the emerging market category to the solitary, windswept &ldquo;standalone&rdquo; category, which includes Venezuela, Ghana, Zimbabwe and other outliers.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Greek-Stocks-Trail-Europe-07012015-LG.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Greek Stocks Trail Europe\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Greek-Stocks-Trail-Europe-07012015.gif\"/> <u>  click to enlarge </u></a>This past April, Cyprus lifted the last of its capital controls. Although it was a painful process, things are moving in a positive direction. Let&rsquo;s hope the people of Greece make the right decision so that their country can likewise begin the recovery process.<h3> Greece Unlikely to Leave the Eurozone</h3>Obviously this topic is of interest to our investors, so I&rsquo;ll be sure to update you on how our investment team is handling the situation. For now, it&rsquo;s important to know that a Grexit is unlikely to happen. Such a move would be a huge, symbolic blow not only to Greece, one of the earliest members of the fledgling European Community, but also the monetary experiment known as the euro. Even Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras admits that the cost to the EU for kicking Greece out of the eurozone would be too immense.The uncertainty has sent shockwaves through world markets, prompting investors to seek safety in core investment assets, including municipal bonds.",

    "content": "<p> Do you feel like now is the right time to take your career to the next level? If so, why aren&rsquo;t you doing anything about it? Perhaps it&rsquo;s because there are barriers standing in your way and keeping you from achieving something greater.</p><p> Barriers are just imaginary obstacles that prevent you from doing things. Although these barriers are abstract or imaginary, they often seem so real that you think you&rsquo;re actually experiencing them. To overcome this, you must learn to acknowledge your own fears whenever you choose to resist anything. Once you gain an understanding of your fears, you will be better prepared to move on and with confidence.</p><h3> These are the common barriers many of us have to deal with:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Time </strong></p><p> Time is something you have to give yourself. Many people tend to think too much about others and other people&rsquo;s needs that they forget what they need. Focusing too much on other people is exhausting, and it can leave you not having enough time for yourself. It requires conscious effort so you can have enough time for yourself.</p><p> <strong>  Fear of Change </strong></p><p> Change is often very scary, so many of us prefer the status quo. Ironically, these people say that they will do whatever it takes for them to achieve success, but they are not willing to get out of their comfort zone.</p><p> Success often comes to those who are open to change, especially change for the better. It takes a lot of risk and determination for you to take a huge step towards finding a good job and a fulfilling career. And after you have reached success, you just can&rsquo;t stop there. You have to keep seeking ways to be better, and this could again require change.</p><p> <strong>  Fear of Failure </strong></p><p> Nobody wants to fail, so it&rsquo;s safe to say that so many of us just choose not to try for them to avoid the possibility of failure. It&rsquo;s quite normal to hesitate to do something, but having too much fear can be paralyzing. There is no way you can be guaranteed of good results for every decision that you make. Failure is part of life and everybody gets to experience one in their life. The only thing that sets successful people apart is their ability to overcome their fears and do what they think they should do to achieve their goals.</p><p> <strong>  Lack of Support </strong></p><p> For you to be successful in your job or career, you need support. When you obsess about doing something alone, it is likely that you&rsquo;ll end up having setbacks and staying right where you were. Thus, it is important that you also learn to value your relationships with other people, including your family, friends, colleagues and everyone in your network. You might be surprised someday that one of them will be  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   key to your career planning success  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "title": "Charismatic Leadership: Style or Substance?",
    "link": "charismatic-leadership-style-or-substance",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Have you ever watched a charismatic person &ldquo;work&rdquo; a room? At the outset, they assess the collective mood. Then they advance to the gathering with a demeanor that suits the environment and their desired role within it. Moving from one person to the next, they engage each individual, albeit briefly, as though that person was a VIP. Regardless of authenticity, personality can be an irresistible force.</p><p> No one knows this better than political parties. America&rsquo;s Democrats had a 50 year love affair with the Kennedys. And when a Kennedy wasn&rsquo;t available for the White House, the Party discovered two other charismatic personalities in Bill Clinton and Barrack Obama to occupy it. Meanwhile, Republicans desperately search for a candidate with the charm of Ronald Reagan.</p><p> In political contests, style is prerequisite number one. Is this also the case in business leadership? If it is, the notion begs a second question; can aspiring leaders and rookie CEOs find the captivating style that is bestowed upon the chosen few? Those who strive for this quality are known to study the art and the science of leadership presence. They take courses on public speaking, they learn how to stand out in group settings, they search out mentors and leadership coaches who help them engage, connect and influence others. These measures will certainly help to improve one&rsquo;s leadership presence.</p><p> That&rsquo;s all well and good except for the fact that <strong>   in business contests, style IS NOT prerequisite number one. </strong>  Style is number two. When astute boards of directors are choosing their next CEO, they begin their search by looking for substance &ndash; the candidate&rsquo;s track record of accomplishment. I&rsquo;m not for a moment saying that presence isn&rsquo;t important.  <strong>  CEOs with style AND substance are potent forces.  </strong> This explains why style weighs heavily in the selection criteria. Boards know that CEOs must motivate the organization&rsquo;s employees to do great things. Great things bring great profits.</p><p> The pertinent point is that charisma is but one factor contributing to presence. Essential to leadership presence at the top are several elements of substance that make for success over the long haul. These are the qualities that help leaders transform followers from the ordinary to extraordinary. They have nothing to do with good looks, a million dollar smile, a firm handshake, or the gift of the gab. Here are 9 vital elements of leadership substance and 1 vital element of CEO substance:</p><li> <strong>  Great leaders share compelling visions. </strong>  Visions are the catalysts to inspire people to go the extra mile to help the leader and their colleagues to get to a better place.</li><li> <strong>  Great leaders are open and approachable.  </strong> They tell individuals and teams what they expect, and why the hard work that must be done is important to the entire organization.</li><li> <strong>  Great leaders exude trust. </strong>  When leaders trust employees, employees trust leaders.</li><li> <strong>  Great leaders are genuine. </strong>  Honor, honesty and authenticity impacts every follower and makes their daily efforts meaningful.</li><li> <strong>  Great leaders act collaboratively.  </strong> They take the time to walk the factory, asking people what they think. Surprise, surprise . . . because these leaders are listeners, employees tell them what they think.</li><li> <strong>  Great leaders put their employees first. </strong>  Customers come second, shareholders are third. Why? Because happy employees = happy customers = happy shareholders.</li><li> <strong>  Great leaders are courageous. </strong>  In a crisis, they always put their own interests last.</li><li> <strong>  Great leaders are decisive.  </strong> Nothing demotivates faster than procrastination in the C-suite.</li><li> <strong>  Great leaders exhibit confidence. </strong>  They have confidence in themselves and in those on their team. <br/>  </li><p> Great leaders usually make great CEOs, but not always. Steve Jobs was the greatest CEO of our time, but he was also woefully weak in several of the above tenets. Would Apple have risen to such heights without him? Not likely. Jobs&rsquo; weaknesses were no match for his strengths. This is an anomaly. But make no mistake; a great leader will never be a great CEO if he or she doesn&rsquo;t deliver on the final tenet.</p><p> <strong>  Great CEOs get the job done.  </strong> This means skillfully executing strategies that propel companies to superb fiscal performance over the long term.</p><p> By nature, great leaders are time-starved species. So I ask you . . . are you going to spend your time studying and practicing presence techniques or are you going work on the elements of substance that will bring the joy of guiding followers and watching them grow?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Winston Churchill said it best:</p><p> However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.</p><p> Of course, occasionally looking at the results is not enough, but the sentiment is understood. High performing organizations have real time access to dashboard style reporting at many different levels of the company, the role of  <u>  <a href=\"http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/CIO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chief Information Officer  </a> </u>  is increasingly becoming a standard in burgeoning organizations as is a Business Intelligence role that helps translate the vast quantities of data available into usable information by marketing and other departments. Thankfully most companies have moved on from the days of using excel to tally marketing numbers.</p><p> But reporting on individual marketing campaigns gets easier and easier; more and more channels offer their own deep insights and third party reporting solutions pick up any slack from less than insightful channels. What is a more opaque measurement and often overlooked is the measurement of a brand.</p><p> Of course there&rsquo;s a reason we don&rsquo;t hear as much about brand measurement. It&rsquo;s harder to put your finger on, hard to compare one brand to another, where to begin?</p><p> Seth Godin  <u>  <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/12/define-brand.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   defines a brand  </a> </u>  as follows:</p><p> A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer&rsquo;s decision to choose one product or service over another. If the consumer (whether it&rsquo;s a business, a buyer, a voter or a donor) doesn&rsquo;t pay a premium, make a selection or spread the word, then no brand value exists for that consumer.</p><p> I like a simpler definition which states that a brand is the essence or promise of what will be delivered or experienced. If we take that as being what a brand is, it becomes a little easier to measure how well we&rsquo;ve performed against that position. Have we delivered what we promised? Have our customers experienced what they thought they would? What do they say about us?</p><p> To find the answers to these questions and more and to truly get a sense of how well our brand is operating, we can measure  <u>  Brand Awareness </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/05/14/a-common-sense-approach-to-measuring-brand-perception/\" target=\"_blank\">   Brand Perception  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/afektomer/how-can-you-measure-loyalty\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brand Loyalty  </a> </u> . The holy grail of course for marketing teams and brand teams is to tie these analyses back to bottom line results. After all, we don&rsquo;t market and measure for any other reason to improve overall brand equity by driving sales and growth.</p><p> Many different companies have been tracking (and trying to track) overall brand value for years.</p><p> Interbrand has their  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bestglobalbrands.com/2014/ranking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   global brand ranking  </a> </u> ;  <u>  Equitrend </u>  has a brand equity model with elements like familiarity, quality, and purchase consideration to rank brands that create powerful connections with consumers. The stronger the brand, the greater the bond;  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Net Promoter Score  </a> </u>  correlates a brand&rsquo;s score with its bottom line.</p><p> Brand and marketing is nothing more than a virtuous circle that begins with a company&rsquo;s goal, flows on into brand strategy, marketing tactics, measurement, refinement and back to goals. What is it that you need to measure in your company to prove marketing and brand contribution to the goals? Hard ROI numbers are always sought and welcomed by the CEO but to demonstrate the &ldquo;immeasurable&rdquo;, consider overall brand metrics to augment your numbers.</p>",

Sorry I have to get back to work!</p><p> YA Inappropriate</p><p> Let me provide some context: &ldquo;YA Inappropriate&rdquo; recently moved to Chicago (where I have many contacts) and got my name from a colleague. YA wanted support, help learning about Chicago, and assistance finding a job. The gap between the email from me that prompted his message above was about two months.</p><p> At first glance, YA&rsquo;s email appears courteous, cordial&mdash;even friendly. However, upon closer inspection, YA is clearly composing personal emails on the job. He&rsquo;s also likely surfing the Internet for non-company reasons. YA also seems oblivious about the impression he&rsquo;s making on me, someone he hopes can help him make connections in his new city. What are the chances this behavior is &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; for YA?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the content of YA&rsquo;s message again, with my comments in italics.</p><p> Hi Stewart, (He incorrectly spelled my name, which is part of my email address. We&rsquo;ve exchanged several emails and I pointed out the error before. YA is either not detail oriented, doesn&rsquo;t pay attention, or simply doesn&rsquo;t care.)</p><p> Good morning! Hey I apologize for never updating you and for not getting back to your last email. I meant to (Does YA believe stating he &ldquo;meant to&rdquo; forgives the long gap between messages?), I&rsquo;ve just been super busy lately&hellip;I&rsquo;m sure you know how that goes (Is YA implying his slow response is the kind of behavior I exhibit when I&rsquo;m busy?) I actually moved to Chicago three weeks ago from tomorrow and I love it! I started working for a commercial real estate company, which I really like so far. Great work atmosphere and I&rsquo;m really getting along with everyone that works here. The one catch is that its draw pay for the first year and then all commission along with some long hours. (Grammatical errors aside, YA never mentions loving his job&mdash;just the atmosphere and the people. He doesn&rsquo;t love the compensation program or the long hours. I can only imagine he&rsquo;s already looking for a new job.)</p><p> Anyways, I still wouldn&rsquo;t mind hearing about this opening your client has available just so in case something does change down the road (He IS looking for a new job&mdash;or at least open to it&mdash;and likely took his current position just to get to Chicago). Let me know if your (poor grammar/misspelling) available for lunch sometime otherwise we could plan a time to talk on the phone. Sorry I have to get back to work! (He admits to stealing from his employer!)</p><p> You may think of me as being overly critical and that this example is extreme. However, where there&rsquo;s smoke, there&rsquo;s fire. YA&rsquo;s email is the tip of the iceberg. Many of my clients who review their company email logs find similar activities.</p><p> Networking is a big part of doing business and people must remember that even these actions should stay professional in all respects, including not doing personal networking on the company dime.</p><p> The choice is yours!</p>",

    "content": "<p> I've had the same conversation with three different professional services firm this summer so far - <strong>  have we got our pricing right? </strong>   None of the individuals I had spoken to were confident about whether or to what degree pricing was a factor in winning or not winning pitches, or what role fees or costs were playing in client retention or repeat business.</p><p> Tellingly none of these firms have a formal feedback process for pitches (successes or failures) or exiting clients.</p><p> Now in fairness I do a lot of work in the private client market where formal pitching is rarer than it is in the corporate world. As the managing partner of Charles Russell Speechlys put it in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wealthbriefing.com/html/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wealthbriefing  </a> </u>  last year:  &ldquo;Private wealth requires a certain approach, which is inconsistent with the procurement-led legal services market.&rdquo;</p><p> But formal pitches and beauty parades are becoming more common, particularly where there is another adviser introducing that business be it another lawyer, an accountant, a private banker, trust consultant, financial adviser or similar (the referral networks in the private client world are complex to put it mildly).  Other professionals in my experience are generally extremely happy to give their views on firms that have or have not been successful in winning their client&rsquo;s business.</p><p> In addition while there remains a reticence in many quarters about quizzing private clients on their likes and dislikes outside the confines of a formal client take-on process and/or within a very established relationship, I think that is changing.  In addition in my first-hand experience private clients are, if it is handled deftly and in the right context, more than happy to give their views. As one high net worth individual put it to me recently: \"It is my money after all.&rdquo;</p><p> Formal feedback not only provides intelligence which saves planning on anecdote (of which I have an absolute horror! ), it can also keep the conversation open as a failed pitch, a client exit or a failure to win repeat business need not be the end of the story.  Introducers have other clients and formal feedback is an indication you are trying to do everything to impress them and their clients.  In addition, clients who pick someone else may not always be impressed by the subsequent experience and may well revert to you later  &ndash; particularly if you were the firm that bothered to ask why it was they didn&rsquo;t employ you in the first  place.</p><p> Implementing a formal client feedback programme at all stages of the client lifecycle will, over time, improve your return on investment of time and money if nothing else by taking some of the guess work out.  In addition to aiding with pricing quandaries, it will uncover if  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights-and-observations/what-s-your-practice-story-getting-your-story-straight/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your story is muddled  </a> </u> , if clients and advisers don&rsquo;t see the benefit you can bring, whether your competitors are just more convincing presenters and so on. </p><p> For FCA-regulated firms there is an additional conduct risk upside of being able to evidence why clients leave and what you are doing about it if problems are systemic and not just &ldquo;c&rsquo;est la vie&rdquo;!</p>",

So here is the challenging question: is your leadership transformational? In Leadership: Theory and Practice , Peter Northouse writes, &ldquo;Transformational Leadership is a process that changes, and transforms people. It is concerned with emotions, values, ethics, standards and long-term goals.&rdquo; <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a> Bringing about transformative change in our team-members is not going to happen in a workshop.  It is not going to happen by discussing product features, compensation structures, or feedback on completed tasks. Such transactional leadership is of value, but it will not tap into the emotions, values and deeply held morality of a person in such a way that they are literally moved to a new plane of consciousness and ability in their work.</p><p> In my experience, to be a transformational leader is to become completely engrossed in the lives of our staff; in their motivations, emotions&mdash;in their purpose at work. Such an environment is intentional, intense, and requires a deep level of permission and trust. This happens in waves, and such waves cannot be condensed or skipped. And here is the part that requires our greatest discipline: we need to know when to leave people alone&mdash;to be absent&mdash;to let them process and work through lessons on their own. Transformative change, in my experience, simply cannot occur while we are standing there, with someone, in the moment. Transformative change requires us to create a movement&mdash;a flow&mdash;where we move into a discussion that introduces new concepts, offers alignment with personal goals and values, and then we must leave people alone to allow the process to happen. When we re-engage we begin by seeking permission to move the dialogue ahead.</p><p> Trust me that you will know when the transformation has occurred. Your team, and you, will be working at a level that none of you has witnessed before; and much of the change will have occurred when you were not around!</p>Published with acknowledgement to Thomson Carswell, publishers of the 2ndedition ofSales Force Management in the Financial Servicesby Paul K.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://www.positioning4retirement.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Positioning4Retirement  </a> </u></p><h3> Savings Are Depleted Quickly If Not Properly Protected</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a tendency to give a silent cheer any time the average life expectancy grows a little longer. But long life also has its downsides.</p><p> &ldquo;Not everyone will spend all of their retirement years being active and doing all the fun things they planned,&rdquo; says Mark Cardoza, author of the book &ldquo;Positioning 4 Retirement.&rdquo; &ldquo;Many people will end up needing long-term care, such as in nursing homes, and that can be expensive. How to pay for that care is a looming problem for a lot of people.&rdquo;</p><p> Cardoza began learning about long-term care needs when his father became terminally ill about a decade ago. Much of what he learned was not reassuring.</p><p> The federal government knew as far back as the 1970s and 1980s that long-term care of aging Americans would become a growing issue, Cardoza says.</p><p> &ldquo;They realized that the American public saw growing old and being cared for as an entitlement,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Instead of educating people and creating political trauma, they developed what we now know as &lsquo;qualified retirement plans.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><p> Such plans include the popular 401k plans that many employers offer in lieu of pensions these days. They are attractive because they allow people to defer taxes on the money placed in the account, and some employers offer matching funds.</p><p> But retirement savings can be vulnerable when a person needs long-term care, Cardoza says.</p><p> The cost of long-term care can deplete retirement savings pretty quickly. One option for offsetting some of the costs is to apply for Medicaid. But in some cases, unless retirement savings are properly protected, they can be considered an asset and must be spent first before Medicaid kicks in, Cardoza says.</p><p> He says there are several options for protecting your retirement savings and getting the most out of those dollars you so painstakingly set aside throughout your working years. A few options include:</p><p> <b>  &bull;  Long-term care insurance. </b> A long-term care insurance policy, if properly designed, will provide your family with financial, physical, and emotional resources while protecting your assets. Financially, it is a way to self-insure, using assets to pay for coverage, entirely or while getting through the look-back period. A long-term care insurance policy is a disability plan. It doesn&rsquo;t replace incomes as a typical disability plan would; instead, it provides income to pay for necessary services in the event of accident, illness, or aging and being unable to do everyday tasks.</p><p> <b>  &bull;  Fixed annuities. </b> An annuity is an insurance product. Money is placed in the annuity with the insurance company&rsquo;s promise to pay an amount in the future as a lump sum or in intervals over a decided period of time. Fixed annuities are designed to protect your retirement assets from financial catastrophe. They can also provide security and protect your retirement income by providing an income stream either for the rest of your life or for a defined period of time.</p><p> <b>  &bull;  Irrevocable trusts. </b> An irrevocable trust is used to protect assets, minimize estate tax liability, avoid probate, and maintain privacy. These trusts are designed to protect qualified funds, in which taxes could be deferred, and non-qualified funds, for which tax deferrals were not allowed.</p><p> Ultimately, Cardoza says, before making any decisions it&rsquo;s best to consult with a professional who understands the intricacies of retirement planning.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<strong> Think for a moment how your team communicates on a daily basis.</strong>What does it sound like? Is it idle chit chat, meaningful conversation, or perhaps professional collaboration?Growing your business relies on all team members learning to express themselves clearly, translate ideas into action, and implement and utilize workflows to accomplish tasks and projects at hand.Although rarely addressed, effective internal communication is a critical element and a vital part to support innovation, employee engagement, and goal achievement for high performing teams. A study cited by <u> <a href=\"https://blog.weekdone.com/10-ways-improve-internal-communications/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Weekdone </a></u>, indicates that companies who promote and follow best practices for communication, not leaving it to chance, are 4.5 times more likely to have highly engaged employees and 20 percent less employee turnover.Teams who have a communication process in place outperform their counterparts both in efficiency and, you guessed it &ndash; financially.Let&rsquo;s take a look at what is seldom taught; how a team can communicate effectively to get things done.Ultimately, in a team environment, the purpose of communication is to be productive with as much harmony as possible. In this sense, the quality of communication is measured by three benchmarks:<li> Communication without confusion</li><li> Providing complete information (nothing is missing)</li><li> Providing specific and rational context</li>Inevitably, a combination of these elements will lead and direct your team to a focal point, accountability, and reduced communication cycles. Here are some key fundamentals to incorporate into an effective communication plan:<h3> Essential Principles for Great Team Communication</h3><strong> 1) Make Your Mission and Vision Clear</strong>Whether as part of your hiring and onboarding process or as a static reminder, take time to explain your firm culture, mission, and vision. When employees are united in their understanding of the business goals, they are able to communicate with one another more effectively in order to achieve them.<strong> 2) Encourage Interdependence</strong>The best way to get teams to function like a team is through shared employee experiences and creating interdependence. No one wins unless everyone wins. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Partner team members together for specific projects, create shared metrics, and encourage brainstorming sessions to share ideas, encourage creativity, and address project alternatives.<strong> 3) Assign and Share Project Values</strong>This is one of my favorite principles because it works. Assign tangible values to every deliverable completed in your office and publicize it to your team. The philosophy underlying this principle is simple; all team members have a clear understanding of the value everyone provides, including their own.<li> Identify the value of each project</li><li> Establish metrics that quantify the identified value</li><li> Confirm the value delivered</li>If a project doesn&rsquo;t support the firms goals in a tangible way, the team shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it.<strong> 4) Make Goals Public &ndash; Be Transparent</strong>Publish company, team, and personal goals in a common area so they are visible. Research objectives and key results (OKR) and document them. Ensure that the purpose of every action is crystal clear and that it is obvious to everyone who is doing what and why. This has proven to be a successful system used by Google.<strong> 5) Establish a Collaborative Environment  </strong>Teamwork is built on trust. Allow time for leaders and team members to get to know one another and develop relationships. Regardless of hierarchy, demonstrate that everyone&rsquo;s input is highly valued. When leaders and the team can count on support from one another to reach goals, they will succeed.Finally, don&rsquo;t forget to include a means for feedback. Feedback is critical to improve performance and reduces the chance for misunderstandings.There is a difference between good communication and great communication. A few simple strategies will streamline your communication, keeping it clear and concise, saving you hours each week. By adopting internal communication practices, you&rsquo;ll be on your way to building a stronger team.",

Basically, I LOVE writing for the Science of People&mdash;and am so grateful to you for reading!</p><p> I am constantly looking for ideas, pictures and article topics in my daily life and have pages and pages of notes for possible posts. I spend weeks honing topics, finding research and coming up with titles to make sure that everything we put up is extremely relevant (and of course anti-boring!).</p><p> So I was more than miffed when I noticed a fellow blogger was poaching our blog topics. About 2 or 3 weeks after we would come out with a post, we would see a strikingly similar post go up on their blog&mdash;citing the same research and quotes!</p><p> Bah! It made me so mad!!!! He was stealing all of our hard work and watering down the topic. My first instincts:</p><li> I wanted to rain farts upon his brand.</li><li> I wanted to shoot arrows at his articles.</li><li> I wanted retribution.</li><p> It was such a powerful feeling that I began to research the psychology of revenge and discovered the scientific seeds of this article. Before I get into how I dealt with this blogging monster, here&rsquo;s what I found about the science and psychology of retribution.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/J-eMTaPklBo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-01-at-7.58.15-AM-2.png\" width=\"846\"/> </a></p><p> click to watch  </p><h3> What Is Revenge?</h3><p> <br/> Revenge (n) the action of inflicting hurt or harm on someone for an injury or wrong suffered at their hands; the desire to inflict retribution.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the juice of so many TV dramas and movie sagas, but should it play an important role in our real lives?</p><p> I want to explore the dark, secretive and mysterious science and psychology of revenge. As much as we hate to admit it, revenge is one of those intense feelings that comes up for every single human being.</p><p> Have you ever been wronged and wished you could punish the perpetrator? This desire is wired within us. Revenge is a powerful internal force we must seek to understand.</p><h3> The Science of Revenge:</h3><p> <br/> A group of Swiss researchers wanted to know what happens in the brain when someone reaps revenge.</p><li> They scanned the brains of people who had just been wronged during a game in the lab.</li><li> The researchers then gave the wronged participant a chance to punish the other person, and for a full minute as the victim&rsquo;s contemplated revenge, the activity in their brain was recorded.</li><li> Immediately, researchers noticed a rush of neural activity in the caudate nucleus. This is the part of the brain known to process rewards. <br/>  </li><p> Big Idea: This study found that revenge, in the moment, is quite rewarding.</p><p> However, they wanted to know one more thing: Does revenge keep rewarding?</p><h3> The Long-Term Effects of Revenge:</h3><p> <br/> We often believe that exacting revenge is a form of emotional release and that getting retribution will help us feel better. Movies often portray the act of revenge as a way of gaining closure after a wrong. But in fact, revenge has the opposite effect.</p><p> Even though the first few moments feel rewarding in the brain, psychological scientists have found that instead of quenching hostility, revenge prolongs the unpleasantness of the original offense.</p><p> Instead of delivering justice, revenge often creates only a cycle of retaliation.</p><p> &ldquo;A man that studieth revenge, keeps his own wounds green, which otherwise would heal.&rdquo; &ndash;Francis Bacon</p><h3> What to Do with Revenge:</h3><p> <br/> Revenge re-opens and aggravates your emotional wounds. Even though you might be tempted to punish a wrong, you end up punishing yourself because you can&rsquo;t heal.</p><p> But what do you do if you were wronged? How can you deal with the intense emotional feelings of retribution? What do you do if you feel an intense need for revenge?</p><p> There is a healthy way to deal with these feelings that can help you heal and give your brain the same amount of rewards without the consequences.</p><h3> Healthy Revenge:</h3><p> <br/> Are you ready for it? This one comes from the amazing, prolific, Frank Sinatra. In his words:</p><p> &ldquo;The best revenge is massive success.&rdquo; &ndash;Frank Sinatra</p><p> The next time you feel the dark tendrils of revenge creeping into your soul, I want you to take that intensity and put it towards succeeding.</p><p> Put it towards your goals.</p><p> Put it towards hustling to get what you want.</p><p> Put it towards growth. </p><p> Get the reward center of your brain pumping by thinking about how sweet it will feel when you meet your goals. This shifts the focus onto you and your mission and makes your perpetrator irrelevant&ndash;which is exactly where they should be.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/el9Qa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Only healthy revenge for me!  </a> </u>   <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/el9Qa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p><h3> A Happy Non-Revenge Ending:</h3><p> <br/> As you might have guessed, I did not rain farts upon my competitor&rsquo;s blog. I did not shoot arrows at his articles. I did not seek retribution. After reading this study, I decided to completely turn away from what he was doing and focus all of my energy into making our blog even better.</p><p> His content stealing actually gave us one of the best insights we could have ever had about our blog:</p><p> We had to make our content un-stealable.</p><p> Anyone can write about studies. Anyone can make bullet points. But not everyone can share stories. Not everyone can do original research. Not everyone can have cool videos.</p><p> This poacher inspired me to level-up our posts. Instead of posting basic steps and bullets, I pushed our team to come up with creative graphics, film and edit cool videos and not post articles until we had really good real life examples.</p><p> Yes, this made it much harder for him to steal our posts (and now he only does it occasionally) but more important, it made our blog better for our readers. We started getting more shares, comments and likes. Hoorah!</p><p> So here we go:</p><h3> Thank you for stealing our content. You made us work harder.</h3><p> <br/> Next time you feel revenge, take that energy and put it into being better.</p><p> It&rsquo;s your time. Focus on your success, not their revenge.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you managed to make it this far into the post, I will stroll all the way to the edge of the limb and guess you&rsquo;ve heard this song before. I&rsquo;ll also wager one of my two dogs that you require no explanation regarding how you might benefit from reading the rest.</p><p> I&rsquo;m comfortable making these predictions (perhaps to the dismay of my fur babies) because this post contains a title that&rsquo;s been sung so many times before (probably by people much smarter than I am). Even so, wonderful lyrics have a knack for making people want to sing, so here&rsquo;s my rendition of this title.</p><p> <strong>  They quit&hellip;the things that don&rsquo;t matter. </strong> Someone asked me last week how I could possibly operate a company, write a weekly post, crank out three books, speak, volunteer, plan a wedding, take care of the dogs, exercise every day, and cook dinner every night. My answer was simple. I have nothing in my life that doesn&rsquo;t mean the world to me. It&rsquo;s amazing how much you can do when that&rsquo;s the case.</p><p> <strong>  They finish&hellip;the things that do matter. </strong> Finished is better than perfect. Perfect is the enemy of progress. If you&rsquo;re a perfectionist, you&rsquo;re doomed to a life of no or slow progress&hellip;while you tinker with things to get them &ldquo;perfect.&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m not speaking of honing your brain surgery skills or building a rocket to shoot to the moon. I&rsquo;m talking everyday life and goals.) People who finish are on version 3.0 before perfectionists complete their beta version. Get moving.</p><p> <strong>  They compete&hellip;only with themselves. </strong> You&rsquo;ll never get ahead when you&rsquo;re trying to get even. You&rsquo;ll never reach your true potential as long as you are solely striving to be &ldquo;better than&rdquo; someone else. If you insist on the &ldquo;better than&rdquo; formula, just be better than you were yesterday.</p><p> <strong>  They never miss&hellip;the right opportunities. </strong> When they see a fork in the road, one of the tines dissolves rather quickly because they analyze quickly and listen to their gut. They know whether an opportunity is right because they feel it. The heart always knows before the mind catches up. Heart = faster learner. Mind = slow learner.</p><p> <strong>  They listen to themselves&hellip;never letting others pollute their desires. </strong> While they might seek counsel from time to time, they own every decision they&rsquo;ve ever made because they made it&mdash;not someone else.</p><p> <strong>  They are&hellip;who they believe they are. </strong> They don&rsquo;t think this or that. They believe. They believe regardless of what you think of them or what&rsquo;s possible. They believe, but they never flaunt it.</p><p> <strong>  They never judge&hellip;themselves or others. </strong> They know they&rsquo;ve given their best on any given day. They know they made the best choice at the time with the information they had. Most importantly, they know they&rsquo;ve learned and are a better person today because of that choice and experience.</p><p> <strong>  They do things for themselves&hellip;and hope others will join along and benefit. </strong> I&rsquo;m referring to the healthiest type of selfishness. Deep down, when you develop something, perform a service, and so on, solely for someone else, your desire won&rsquo;t last and your output will be less than stellar. As socially unacceptable as this sounds, I write for myself&mdash;so I can gain clarity and sanity. I pray you&rsquo;ll enjoy it, follow along, and benefit from it. If you don&rsquo;t, I need to be okay with that because otherwise I&rsquo;m turning control of my emotions over to you. Here&rsquo;s a little mantra I&rsquo;d like to leave you with. I&rsquo;ve developed it for myself and say it before I undertake any initiative. It serves as a reminder to me and helps me calibrate my mindset. It also prepares me in advance for any outcome:</p><p> &ldquo;If my life is the only life that&rsquo;s changed as a result of me doing this, is that good enough for me?&rdquo;</p><p> If the answer is &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I do it. If the answer is &ldquo;No,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/N1colaRay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Nicola Ray  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://modernb2b.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Modern  </u> </a></p><h3> Last week I did a Google search for images of &lsquo;female&rsquo; CEOs and was shocked at the results that came back. </h3><p> <br/> With the rising number of CEOs of global companies, including Oracle, HP, Xerox, Yahoo, GM, Lockheed Martin and Pepsico, I would have thought there would have been better results.</p><p> Instead of images showing these women as credible presenters, genuine people, doing their job and being serious doing it (not laughing or smiling sweetly), I was presented with a mixed bag of images, including a woman with her feet up on a desk, a woman in sports kit in the office and far too many women cocking their head into submission and looking pretty with low cut blouses.</p><p> The same search for men, yielded completely different results.  The men were serious, looking powerful and authoritative and there were certainly no gratuitous shots of flesh.</p><p> It makes me sad.  And you wonder why women feel they need more positive role models and lobbying groups such as Women on Boards driving womens&rsquo; agendas in Whitehall?</p><p> It made me think about a discussion we had in the office a few weeks back about the  <u>  <a href=\"http://womenlaughingalonewithsalad.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tumblr Women Laughing Alone With Salad  </a> </u> .  There&rsquo;s much debate on the topic, with some saying that this type of imagery is compounded by magazine editors choosing it and therefore that&rsquo;s what the stock libraries give them.</p><p> That said, my search wasn&rsquo;t on a stock library.  It was on Google &ndash; which compiles images from websites, news sources and stock libraries &ndash; and the visuals that the search throw up, really weren&rsquo;t that much better.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-02-at-11.21.17-AM-2.png\" width=\"779\"/></p><p> For the women, the images are wide smiles with lots of teeth, far too many tilted heads and surprisingly windy offices and conference centres as hair blows behind them.  They&rsquo;re a touch contrived, often lacking in authority with just a sniff of sexiness about them.   Go further down the page (outside of this clipping) and you&rsquo;ll find women sitting at their desk in their sports kit or with their feet up, and yes, the shots do get a lot sexier.</p><p> And the men?</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-02-at-11.21.18-AM-2.png\" width=\"781\"/></p><p> There are more serious poses, men at conferences speaking or looking straight to camera with a light smile.  There are hardly any teeth to be seen and certainly no wind blowers on their wavy locks. To even things out, there are a few amusing images like the one with baby in a sling (multitasking) and the CEO with a Mohican haircut.</p><p> For me, the problem I had was that I wanted to provide an illustrator with a selection of female personas to use as a basis for a drawing that suggested a positive role model where success was based on ability, not on looks, physique or sexiness.  What surprised me was that it was harder than I thought, even with the female CEOs that grace our top global businesses.</p><p> Only  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-ceos-sp-500\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5% of the Fortune 500 companies have a female CEO  </a> </u> . In the UK, we have  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/11089789/FTSE-100-who-are-the-five-women-bosses.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 women at the helm of FTSE 100 companies  </a> </u>  (a similar percentage to the US).</p><p> So why not more positive imagery? One day, I&rsquo;ll hope that the woman laughing alone with salad will be a thing of the past.  What are your thoughts?</p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It's true. Spotify thinks my 10 year old daughter is 25. To be fair, Instagram thinks her 12 year old friend is 23. And Apple thinks my 13 year old neighbor is 17. Welcome to self-reported user data. The reality, and we all know this, is that people will say what they need to say in order to achieve the outcome they desire. In this case, every kid I know has lied about their age to some company somewhere in order to gain access to whatever web-based service they want use. </p><h3> I know what you should be thinking right now &ndash; this is old news.</h3><p> <br/> And you&rsquo;d be right for thinking that. Everyone knows that the demographic data upon which media-buying decisions are made is self-reported. (Everyone knows that right?) And yet&hellip; as my daughter informed me of her &ldquo;age&rdquo; on Spotify, it struck me that some ad-tech agency or digital marketer somewhere is buying ads targeting &ldquo;25 year old females living in Los Angeles who love pop music&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re getting my 10 year old kid. Which, at least to me, is hysterical&hellip; in an ironic way.</p><h3> Marketing and advertising exist for a reason - generating sales and driving revenue.</h3><p> <br/> There's no question that the ROI for your ad spend, your ad targeting, matters. Whether your goal is keeping existing customers or finding new ones, a data strategy based upon better look-alike modeling for your ad spend is critical to success. And, at least compared to the way we used to buy ads for print or television, we are making great strides in look-alike modeling.</p><h3> BUT, and this is the big but. </h3><p> <br/> The quality of the decisions you make are dependent upon the quality of the data you have. Stated differently, how big is your data? Consider this: only when you can correlate multiple data points can you find the anomalies - like all the kids (and adults) I know of who regularly lie about their age - in order to get more accurate insight into your customers for more effective advertising.  By contrast, if you've only got limited data available for your modeling and spending decisions, and much (all) of that data is self-reported, is it really of any use at all? Maybe. But then again, it may simply be a case of  garbage in, garbage out. </p><p> Which brings me back to the risk my \"25 year old daughter\" poses to your digital marketing strategy. The truth is that someone out there knows that my 10 year old is not 25. Spotify may, in fact, even know. The question is, when you&rsquo;re making your ad buys, do you know? And if you don&rsquo;t, how much is your ignorance costing you?</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you have realized that your conflict with your partner isn&rsquo;t going away, that self-awareness bodes well.  But you may be wondering, &ldquo;we spent hours talking about our problem with little to no change, how is talking some more to a stranger going to help us?&rdquo;</p><p> The answer is that a third party can be a powerful force to change existing dynamics. Change, as we all know, is hard.  It takes recognition of what the problem is, identifying a new way of doing things, and then activating learning pathways in our brain. One way a mediator can help is associating a reward with the outcome that comes from taking an action.</p><h3> What value can a third party bring to affect change in the parties?</h3><p> <br/> The third party will hear things the parties to the conflict can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t hear.  Neuroscientists have found that the brain conserves energy by following patterns, and listening to your partner detail your role in the problem certainly qualifies as a pattern your brain will recognize and fill in the rest, not really listening.   However, the neutral will use nonjudgmental inquiry to stimulate your brain&rsquo;s cognitive mode.  The parties may come to some realizations that are inconsistent with the mindset they have developed toward the conflict &ndash; and that cognitive dissonance can be a catalyst for change.</p><p> Research suggests people change for one of two reasons: they are avoiding something they fear or seeking out a reward/better situation.  Change that comes from seeking out a reward is more likely to stick -- and the third party can help the sides see the rewards and possibilities of different outcomes.</p><p> Having a neutral third party hold up different alternatives minimizes &ldquo;reactive devaluation&rdquo; which is when you reject an alternative or solution merely because it has been suggested by the other side.</p><h3> How do they do this?</h3><p> <br/> A mediator of facilitator will use three key skills to help get to sustainable change among those in conflict:</p><li> Questioning and reformulating</li><li> Active Listening</li><li> Reading Non Verbal Cues</li><p> <br/> <strong>  A successful change agent offers a process that makes the participants feel heard and ready to take the conversation from &ldquo;what happened&rdquo; to &ldquo;how do we move forward and work together in the future.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> The last value the third party brings to the parties in transition is accountability.  Checking in on the progress towards the goals, offering tweaks and refinements, and encouragement to go on in the face of any short-term stumbles are all ways the &ldquo;change agent&rdquo; makes the change the parties needed.</p><p> Thanks to Neuroawareness, Francois Bogacz, and Jeremy Lack</p>",

    "title": "Are You a Warrior at Work?",
    "link": "are-you-a-warrior-at-work",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> You have seen the person who is a warrior at work. You know that person who readies for battle, the win-at-all-costs type of person? You may be that person; do you see the finish line and let nothing get in your way? And when you do cross it, it is on to the next task and battle &ndash; you are going to outwork, outthink, and outlast everyone else. You are the warrior body disposition. As we continue our study of how the body shows up in leadership, we now look at the body of the warrior, the driver, the body of determination. He or she is moving toward success, in their actions, at all times. In the body of the warrior we see the following:</p><p> <strong>  Overall view of the world: </strong> This is the body of take charge, of determination, the warrior spirit, the athlete in competition, taking all challengers on in the struggle. It is the body that puts itself at risk for the sake of something larger than itself, risking for an ideal. This is the body that will not fail, will not let its master down. It is also the body that controls its feelings, not allowing them to show, because feelings can be a sign of weakness and caring, and this body does not have time for them.</p><p> <strong>  Moods and emotions: </strong>  Moods and emotions in this body are not welcome; they can be the enemy of getting things done. They can be that which takes us off task so they are pushed out of sight, many times just below the surface. If there are emotions allowed it is often those of anger and resentment, but only in a limited quantity, because after all there are tasks to be completed, time is limited. When emotions come out in this body it is often with intensity, in a flare of anger, in a focused barrage of feedback for the unlucky recipient, then it is back to work. If feelings appear of the sort perceived to show weakness, such as caring, pain, or sadness, they are quickly corralled and sent back into hiding. Even emotions that create laughter and spontaneous silliness, and those of joy and happiness only peek out briefly before the job ahead ushers them back.</p><p> <strong>  How it manifests in the body: </strong> In the body of determination, one is striving, so the body is leaning forward, the direction of success. The head and eyes are focused on the desired direction, but are open to any new important stimuli. The face can seem to have a hint of tension, coming across to many as anger. There is not much smiling or other overt signs of emotions. Since the body&rsquo;s energy is slightly forward, there is tension throughout the body to counteract gravity, and the feet are not planted on the ground; the knees loose and ready to move forward. The chest is out towards the world, expansive, and ready to have challenges bounce off it like Superman or Superwoman. The greater the challenge in this body the greater the tension, the greater the focus and muscle tension. The body also can come across as closed and uptight to others, not warm or open.</p><p> <strong>  The Mantra of this body: </strong>  The mantra that arises in this body is &ldquo;THIS is the direction we are going!&rdquo;  Or, &ldquo;I WILL be successful.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Where this body might serve or hinder you: </strong>  The advantage of this body is the ability to direct the individual to success, regardless of the challenges or the adversity in the way. This body is hardened to weakness and fear, which allows it to take on great challenges and persevere.</p><p> The challenge in this body is that the tenderness and caring that supports others and allows for mistakes is kept controlled, often sending the message to the world that this person is mean and callous. In determination, you are intentionally putting yourself, or some part of yourself, at risk for the sake of something larger such as an ideal, idea, vision, value, village or nation. When leading, determination allows you to risk your employee or team not liking you as a result of you making a fiercely passionate move or decision, or asking that bold, difficult question out of your commitment to the larger vision or purpose. Remember, there is a difference between being liked and being respected.</p><p> In this body, as in all bodies, the greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. Yes, it gets results, but many times the cost to others and to relationships is great. To show up as the warrior at work means that we are always ready for battle, but the reality is that not everything is a battle. It follows the old adage, &lsquo;If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything becomes a nail&rsquo;!</p>",

    "content": "<p> You know how your brain acts when you&rsquo;re tired: it&rsquo;s hard to remember things and your thoughts are sluggish. <strong>  Sleep deprivation strongly impairs memory and learning </strong> , and research confirms it this (though the actual mechanism causing these deficits has escaped detection). However, a recent study done on persons with sleep apnea may provides some much-needed answers as to why.</p><p> In a study conducted at the University of California, San Diego, 55 men and women with sleep apnea were studied. Blood cortisol levels were checked every two hours for 24 hours. The patients underwent sleep studies the following night and then took a battery of tests assessing cognitive function. Of particular interest was how many times they stopped breathing, as well as how often their oxygen levels dropped in response to airway obstruction. In previous studies, we have assumed that it is the drop in oxygen that is the main culprit in causing problems with learning and memory. However, in this study they found that it was <strong>  elevated cortisol levels that best predicted cognitive dysfunction. </strong></p><p> The authors point out that their study is in agreement with other studies that have demonstrated <strong>  chronic exposure to elevated cortisol levels can result in impaired cognitive function </strong> . In fact, prior studies have revealed adverse effects of elevated cortisol on a brain structure called the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a structure that resides in the temporal lobe of the brain. It has long been known that it is intimately involved in acquiring information and consolidating that information into long-term memory.</p><p> Why is this important? It may explain why <strong>  sleep-deprived individuals frequently exhibit poor memory and concentration abilities. </strong> We know that insomnia sufferers, and those who chronically get inadequate sleep because of life style choices, have elevated levels of stress hormones such as cortisol. These folks do not have sleep apnea or low nighttime oxygen levels, yet they frequently exhibit cognitive dysfunction similar to patients with sleep apnea. Perhaps what they have in common is elevated levels of the hormone cortisol.</p><p> It is not too far-fetched to see what they have in common is overstimulation of the adrenal gland, which produces cortisol. The common thread being stress, produced by either insufficient, or in the case of sleep apnea, fragmented sleep. It is not inconceivable that measuring cortisol levels in patients with sleep apnea and insufficient sleep may provide an important diagnostic tool. I am hopeful that this might serve as a motivator to convince people of the importance of good quality sleep. A simple lab test would be a great tool to have in convincing people of the need to take their sleep and sleep disorders seriously. I am aware that much of this is still speculative. However, if future studies related to sleep continue to demonstrate this relationship, the possibilities are exciting.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Finding a financial advisor who is right for you is an important process.</p><p> Just like with any working relationship, it&rsquo;s a good idea to interview advisors until you find the one who is the best fit for you, your life, and your financial goals. If you are entrusting your financial well being to someone, shouldn&rsquo;t you get to know them, and their investing philosophy, first?</p><p> Before you speak to potential advisors, take a moment to review and understand where you are in your life, and your current needs and goals. Are you looking for support with saving &ndash; or planning &ndash; for your children&rsquo;s education, with retirement, with saving for your next home, with investment choices and diversification, with how best to handle an inheritance or other windfall? Knowing what you want out of a relationship with your financial advisor &ndash; and what your current priorities are &ndash; is a good place to start the conversation.</p><p> The next step is making sure your needs and preferences align with your potential advisor.</p><p> Here are the top 10 questions you should ask a potential financial advisor:</p><p> <strong>  1. Are you a Fiduciary? </strong> <br/> Advisors generally fall under one of two categories: those who manage assets acting as a Fiduciary and those who advise clients acting as a Non-Fiduciary.  A Fiduciary is regulated by Federal law and must adhere to strict standards: they must act in the client&rsquo;s best interest, and in good faith, and they must provide full disclosure regarding fees, compensation, and any current or potential conflicts of interest. An advisor at a Non-Fiduciary firm generally earns compensation through commissions on the sale of specific investment products and is not regulated by the Federal law mentioned above. Non-Fiduciary advisors are governed, however, by a suitability standard as well as by applicable securities laws and regulations.</p><p> <strong>  2. What is your fee structure? </strong> <br/> Ask your financial advisor to clearly specify their fees. With many layers of diversification that can be applied to your portfolio, you want to be aware of whether you are exposed to up-front charges, back-end fees, expense ratios, and/or whether a percentage of your returns will deducted.</p><p> <strong>  3. What credentials do you have?  </strong> <br/> Ask questions about the financial advisor&rsquo;s prior experience as well as what licenses, registrations, and certifications they hold. Financial advisors can be either Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) or Investment Advisor Representatives (IARs). An RIA is registered either with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state securities authorities and must adhere to a fiduciary standard defined by the  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_Advisers_Act_of_1940\" target=\"_blank\">  Investment Advisers Act of 1940 </a> . An IAR can provide investment related advice on topics on which they have passed the appropriate examinations and make investment recommendations based on suitability for the client. Ask if they hold an MBA or a CFA although, according to wealth manager, blogger, and CFA  <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/the-cfa-vs-mba-decision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ben Carlson </a> , while a degree shows initiative and the fact that you&rsquo;re improving your skills and enriching knowledge base, &ldquo;no one needs either of these to succeed in portfolio management&rdquo; and &ldquo;neither matters if you don&rsquo;t know how to apply them to what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; Bottom line: meet the advisor in person, check references, and do your own due-diligence on the internet.</p><p> <strong>  4. What services do you or your company provide and what makes your services unique? </strong> <br/> A financial advisor should be able to tell you their strengths and what sets them apart. Some advisors provide advice on investments, for instance, while other specialize in comprehensive financial planning around retirement, insurance, estate planning, and tax planning.</p><p> <strong>  5. What is your investment philosophy? </strong> <br/> Every financial advisor has a specific approach to planning and investing. Some advisors prefer actively managed funds versus passive investments. Others may seek to gain high returns and make riskier investments. Make sure your goals and risk tolerance align with the advisor&rsquo;s philosophy.</p><p> <strong>  6. What type of clients do you have? </strong> <br/> Are there particular areas of focus that they specialize in? What is their niche and how will you fit into that? Some financial advisors only target high net-worth individuals, for instance, while others may have areas of specific interest such as domestic planning (marriages or divorces,) and still others may focus on charitable giving or specific kinds of investments, such as socially responsible companies.</p><p> <strong>  7. What is your relationship with your clients? </strong> <br/> Ask how involved they are with their client&rsquo;s portfolios: how hands-on their approach is and how available are they for their different clients&rsquo; needs.</p><p> <strong>  8. Will I be working with you directly or with members of your team? </strong> <br/> If the financial advisor does not work directly with all of his or her clients, make sure you know that ahead of time. Meet the rest of the team, ask the same questions, and make sure you are comfortable with all the people you will be working with.</p><p> <strong>  9. How personalized are your recommendations for your clients? </strong> <br/> It is important that your financial advisor tailors your financial plan to your specific goals. Your retirement plan and investment strategy should be customized to take into account your risk tolerance as well as age, income, net-worth, etc. There should not be a one-size-fits-all approach to managing your money.</p><p> <strong>  10. How often do you review and evaluate each client&rsquo;s portfolio and provide up-to-date assessments? </strong> <br/> Make sure you are aware how often the financial advisor reviews your investments and if the time structure is right for you.</p><p> If you ask these 10 questions, you&rsquo;ll have a much clearer idea of whether a Financial Advisor understands you and your goals, and is going to be a productive partner in helping you work to reach those goals.</p><p> Finally, do not hesitate to ask for a sample financial plan and a written agreement of the services that will be provided. There are wide variations of structures for financial plans and, if there is something you need clarification about, ask the advisor before you get started.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Knowing how to budget or invest one&rsquo;s retirement savings are useful skills. But managing money isn&rsquo;t just about what you know &ndash; <strong>  it&rsquo;s also about how you feel. </strong></p><p> That&rsquo;s the gist of a handful of recent studies into a newly identified emotion known as financial anxiety. These early studies look at two things: 1) is financial anxiety real?; and 2) does it explain why people do things like avoiding money issues or going into debt to paper over their financial problems?</p><p> The evidence says yes to both questions.</p><p> <strong>  A 2012 study established financial anxiety as an identifiable psychological condition that can be measured using a standard psychological test. </strong> The researchers gauged their subjects&rsquo; reaction times to pairs of words flashed on a computer screen &ndash; negative financial words (debt), positive financial words (jackpot), neutral financial words (bank), or anodyne control words (camp). The subjects were timed on how long it took to identify a word after an on-screen icon replaced one word in the pair.</p><p> When only the negative financial word was left on the screen, people with higher financial anxiety were slower to respond than when only the positive word was visible. The prevalence of longer delays for negative words suggests that most subjects had at least some financial anxiety.</p><p> Researchers dived deeper into how financial anxiety influences behavior in another exploratory  <u>  <a href=\"http://newprairiepress.org/jft/vol5/iss2/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u>  that was awarded the Financial Therapy Association&rsquo;s &ldquo;outstanding research paper&rdquo; at its 2014 conference. This study found that people who had lower anxiety levels &ndash; and, counterintuitively, were more physiologically aroused &ndash; were more open to seeing a financial planner. Some researchers had assumed the prospect of dealing with financial issues would elicit a &ldquo;flight&rdquo; response, but the study indicates that arousal can spur people to positive action. On the other hand, people with higher anxiety who were less aroused were less likely to seek help &ndash; similar to the avoidance behavior exhibited in the word experiments.</p><p> Further study is needed, but the researchers conclude that financial planners &ldquo;should not expect those who are experiencing longer-term financial anxiety to enthusiastically demand planning services.&rdquo;</p><p> In fact, they&rsquo;ll probably avoid it.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Fact: The employee experience drives the customer experience. </strong> I know I'm stating the obvious - but, shockingly, to many, it is not that obvious. So many companies still fail to recognize that important connection, to the ultimate detriment of the business. <br/> <br/> Why is the customer experience so bad? Because when 70% of our workforce is \"not engaged\" or \"actively disengaged,\" according to Gallup, we cannot expect to have a great customer experience. If your employees aren't engaged, it will be very difficult for them to delight your customers. If you don't care about what you're doing, it shows. If you're not thrilled with - or passionate about - what you do, your heart's not in it, and really, you are just showing up. Barely. That does not a great experience make. For anyone. In very simple terms, this describes \"the spillover effect.\" <br/> <br/> Gallup defines  <strong>  engaged employees </strong>  as \"those employees working with passion and feeling a profound connection to their companies; they drive innovation and move the organization forward.\"  <strong>  Disengaged employees </strong> , on the other hand, are \"checked out and just putting time, but not energy or passion, into their work.\" They're actually a drain on the engaged workforce, and they \"undermine what their engaged coworkers accomplish.\"  <br/> <br/> As you can see, this is a huge problem! With such a small percentage of engaged employees, we can't have anyone undermining the few. Not only do the disengaged impact the customer experience, but they also impact the experience of their fellow employees. <br/> <br/> I love this quote from Herb Kelleher, which nicely sums up employee engagement: <br/> <br/> &ldquo;Engaged employees are not just committed. They are not just passionate or proud. They have a line-of-sight on their own future and on the organization&rsquo;s mission and goals. They are &lsquo;enthused&rsquo; and &lsquo;in gear,&rsquo; using their talents and discretionary effort to make a difference in their employer&rsquo;s quest for sustainable business success. I&rsquo;ve never had control, and I never wanted it. If you create an environment where people truly participate, you don&rsquo;t need control. They know what needs to be done and they do it.&rdquo;  &ndash;Herb Kelleher, Southwest Airlines <br/> <br/> How, then, do we get to this state of nirvana? <br/> <br/> First and foremost, no one can make an employee engaged. It doesn't work that way. It cannot be mandated. Instead, there must be some confluence of: (1) emotions, commitment, passion, sense of ownership, etc. on the part of the employee about the brand and (2) what the organization does (purpose, brand promise, who the company is and why, etc.) to facilitate and enhance those emotions or that commitment - then we have employee engagement. <br/> <br/> Engagement comes from within the employee. It's the emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure the organization and the brand succeed. What the company can and must do is build a culture and an environment that facilitates employee engagement. <br/> <br/> Here's how companies can do their part:</p><li> Start with hiring the right people </li><li> Provide clear job descriptions that set expectations about roles</li><li> Offer an onboarding process that includes details about what it means to work for your company </li><li> The view from the top must be \"employees more first\" </li><li> Communicate your brand promise and your purpose clearly and consistently</li><li> Define, communicate, and live by your core values; find and hire people who are predisposed to living by those same values</li><li> Provide clarity - of purpose and more </li><li> Give employees direction and (then) freedom</li><li> Empower employees to do and to think for themselves, which means/translates to responsibility, accountability, and ownership</li><li> Treat employees well; respect them, and they'll reciprocate</li><li> Develop and support a culture of employee ownership. Facilitate a grassroots effort to help employees make the brand their own.</li><li> Provide ongoing training and coaching</li><li> Provide a career path and career development </li><li> Ensure that employees have a clear line of sight to the big picture, e.g., company vision and mission, as well as to customers</li><li> Recognize employees for a job well done</li><li> Show appreciation </li><li> Provide performance feedback on a regular basis</li><li> Let employees know how they contribute and how their work matters</li><li> Listen to employees and act on their feedback</li><li> Map the employee journey to really understand their experience</li><li> Communicate openly, candidly, and with transparency </li><li> Eliminate barriers to employee success, e.g., bad policies and processes </li><li> Trust employees</li><li> Lead with integrity <br/>  </li><p> An important thing to remember is that much of this effort on the company's behalf begins with the employee's manager. Yes, company leaders and executives drive a lot of the higher-level items on the list, e.g., vision, mission, etc., but the employee has a much closer relationship with his manager than he does with the CEO. You know how the saying goes:  Employees leave managers, not companies. The manager is critical to the employee experience. <br/> <br/> Make no mistake. Employees who enjoy their work - those who are passionate about what they are doing and for whom they are doing it - deliver results. Because of that enthusiasm and that passion for the brand, for the business, employees are eager to contribute to its success. And when we're all working together for the success of the business, I believe that, ultimately, customers will win, too. As will your shareholders. <br/> <br/> The way your employees feel is the way your customers will feel. And if your employees don&rsquo;t feel valued, neither will your customers. -Sybil F. Stershic</p>",

    "content": "<p> I was having breakfast one morning with the CEO of a large professional firm. He was stepping down after nearly 10 years in the role. He had a busy morning coming up, and after we had chatted for a while, he flagged the waiter for the check.</p><p> I then asked him a very simple question: &ldquo;Roger, you&rsquo;ve had an extraordinary career, and accomplished so much&hellip;Is there something else you&rsquo;d like to achieve&mdash;some dream that you&rsquo;d like to follow?&rdquo; Roger put his coffee down, and gave me a thoughtful look. He smiled. Then, after a further pause, he began to tell me about something very important to him personally that he wanted to develop and focus on. The exact nature of that ambition, which involved a nonprofit initiative, is not really relevant right now. What is relevant is that we continued to talk for another 45 minutes&mdash;way beyond our breakfast appointment. And it was probably the most interesting and passionate discussion we had ever had together.</p><p> That question&mdash;whose answer I genuinely wanted to hear&mdash;simultaneously moved us from the past (his legacy, which so many were talking about) to the future; from the general to the personal (his dream); and from the analytical to the emotional. It created a wonderful, breakthrough conversation.</p><p> In my new book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Power-Relationships-Irrefutable-Building-Extraordinary/dp/1118585682\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Power Relationships  </a> </u> , I describe the twentieth law of relationships in Chapter 20:  It&rsquo;s better to know the right questions than to have all the answers. </p><p> The 1988 winner of the Nobel Prize for literature, Naguib Mafouz, put it this way: &ldquo;You can tell if a man is clever by his answers. You can tell if a man is wise by his questions.&rdquo;</p><p> One helpful way of identifying the different types of questions you should be asking is to think about two key dimensions.</p><li> First, are you focusing on goals and strategy&mdash;the big picture&mdash;or on implementation and execution?</li><li> Second, are you in the realm of the intellect or of the emotions? <br/>  </li><p> If you combine these two dimensions you get four quadrants. I&rsquo;ll walk you clockwise around this &ldquo;Power Questions matrix,&rdquo; shown below.</p><p> <a href=\"http://andrewsobel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PQ-Matrix-for-Blog-II.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"PQ Matrix for Blog II\" src=\"http://andrewsobel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PQ-Matrix-for-Blog-II-1024x869.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> In the lower left quadrant, you&rsquo;ll ask rational or analytical questions about execution: &ldquo;How are you going to do that&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is your timing?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How will that initiative impact your ability to stay close to your customers?&rdquo; and so on.</p><p> In the upper left quadrant, you&rsquo;re still focused on rational or analytical questions, but now you&rsquo;re talking about strategy or the big picture. You might ask questions to get at higher-level goals: &ldquo;Why do you want to do that?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are your most important priorities for this year?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is the business goal driving this program?&rdquo;</p><p> Sometimes, a client starts the conversation in the lower left and you have to bring them up to the goals and strategy quadrant in order to really understand what they are trying to accomplish.</p><p> But remember, facts tell and emotions sell. You must also understand the emotional or personal side of the issue. So in the upper right quadrant you might ask questions like, &ldquo;As you look ahead to the next couple of years, and the various initiatives you have underway, what are you most excited about?&rdquo; You see, the same question in the upper right quadrant&mdash;which is on the analytical side of the matrix&mdash;might sound like &ldquo;What are your most important goals for this year?&rdquo; The former will yield a very different&mdash;and more heartfelt&mdash;response than the latter.</p><p> Finally, in the lower right quadrant you need to ask questions about fears, anxieties, and frustrations; as well as about personal fit and fulfillment. For example, &ldquo;What parts of your implementation program have been most frustrating?&rdquo; or on a personal level, &ldquo;What part of your job is most fulfilling to you?&rdquo;</p><p> So when you next go to meet with a client, think about formulating questions that address these key dimensions: implementation versus strategy; and the rational or analytical versus emotional. Pay especial attention to the two right-hand quadrants, where you ask questions in the emotional realm. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how interesting the conversation becomes when you move from the left, analytical brain to the right brain.</p>",

Building trust with existing and potential clients can go a long way toward strengthening your brand and earning new business. We&rsquo;ve put together a few tips to get you started.</p><h3> Lose the elevator pitch</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;In 30 seconds or less, tell me who you are, what you do and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; what you can do for me. Go!&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve all been to a networking event that started out this way. But with today&rsquo;s increased focus on content and decreased focus on direct sales, we&rsquo;re somewhat surprised the elevator pitch is still around.</p><p> Almost nothing sounds less sincere and, to us, less appealing. Instead, focus on building connections and having real conversations. Figure out what you have in common with your target clients and talk about those things, on your blog and social media or at community events.</p><p> Figure out what you have in common with your target clients and talk about those things, on your blog and social media or at community events.</p><p> Also encourage open and honest feedback, even if it&rsquo;s not private, and act on that feedback. Communication goes both ways.</p><h3> Provide consistent quality</h3><p> <br/> Either directly or indirectly, you&rsquo;ve made your clients a promise about what you can deliver. Now make good on it. Your clients need to know what to expect from you each and every time they work with you. That&rsquo;s what builds brand loyalty and referrals.</p><p> Think about a restaurant you&rsquo;ve been to dozens of times. You like the food, the service is great and the atmosphere is perfect for you. Until that one time you had to wait 30 minutes for your food and the clearly overworked server was self-righteous instead of apologetic.</p><p> It was just one time out of many, but it&rsquo;s the one experience you&rsquo;ll talk about for weeks. And you&rsquo;ll tell your story to anyone who will listen.</p><h3> Be responsive when mistakes happen</h3><p> <br/> Try as you might to be at the top of your game every single day, you will occasionally deliver a less-than-stellar experience. We hate to admit it, but it happens to all of us.</p><p> When it happens to you, respond immediately. Be open and honest. Talk to the client, explain what happened and apologize. Let them know what you&rsquo;re doing to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen again. And listen. It&rsquo;s not easy hearing negative feedback, but would you rather your client tells you all about it or 100 of their closest friends?</p><h3> Become part of your community</h3><p> <br/> Your clients want to know that you care about them and their community. As a company, sponsor and attend community events or support a local charity.</p><p> Your clients want to know that you care about them and their community.</p><p> Support something you truly believe in and can get behind for the long term. And do it because you want other people to become involved, too.</p><p> If your employees do their own charity work, recognize them for it, and ask what you can do to help.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jberiker?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fberiker.com%2Fthing-exit-strategy-even-silicon-valley%2F&amp;profile_id=16385117&amp;tw_i=615935708780490752&amp;tw_p=embeddedtimeline&amp;tw_w=478372734267695104\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   James Beriker  </u> </a>  </p><p> The most common question that I am asked when I interview candidates for leadership positions is: &ldquo;What is your exit strategy?&rdquo; If I pause long enough before answering, the candidate often clarifies the question for me: &ldquo;Are you planning on selling the company or taking it public?&rdquo;</p><p> I have a standard response to this question that I use to engage the candidate in a discussion around what I believe it takes to build a great company. I explain that we do not have an &ldquo;exit strategy,&rdquo; that building a business is not a linear path from inception to &ldquo;exit&rdquo;&ndash; and that having a strategy to sell or take a company public is the wrong way to think about business building. Then I ask the candidate to give me one example of a great company that was built on an &ldquo;exit strategy.&rdquo; I have yet to hear a good answer.</p><p> I explain that our goal is to build a long-term sustainable business: one that has a compelling  <strong>  vision </strong>  for how we want to positively impact the world, a clear  <strong>  mission </strong>  for what we can be the best at, a  <strong>  strategy </strong>  that defines how we compete to win in our market, a  <strong>  culture  </strong> that enables our team to out-execute competitors, and, over time, an  <strong>  economic machine </strong>  that produces a &ldquo;fly-wheel&rdquo; of growth and profitability. Along the way, we will have ups and downs, we may pivot, downsize and upsize&ndash; and may have the opportunity to merge with another company or go public.</p><p> But, we will never have an &ldquo;exit strategy.&rdquo;</p><p> Strong candidates engage with me in a conversation around business building and share their perspectives and their experiences at other companies&ndash; and these conversations can be rich and tell me a lot about the candidate. Some candidates are simply not satisfied with my answer. They are less interested in a discussion around the kind of company I want to help build and more interested in sizing up whether I, as the CEO, have what it takes to convert their efforts and time into a successful outcome for them. These are not the people I hire.</p><p> The most interesting thing about this question, though, is the question itself&ndash; and it reveals a lot about Silicon Valley.</p><p> The Silicon Valley ecosystem is built on liquidity. Entrepreneurs take investments from &ldquo;angels&rdquo; and venture capitalists. Startups use that capital to develop products, build teams, and scale their operations, taking more and more capital as their businesses grow. For successful companies, there is often an opportunity to &ldquo;exit,&rdquo; or more precisely to achieve a liquidity event in which shareholders receive a return for their investment in the company through an acquisition or an IPO. The returns generated from this &ldquo;exit&rdquo; (and often the entrepreneurs and the teams themselves) are recirculated back into the Silicon Valley ecosystem&ndash; and the cycle repeats itself over and over again.</p><p> According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cbinsights.com/venture-capital-silicon-valley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Silicon Valley Tech Venture Capital Almanac  </a> </u> , venture capital firms invested $31.5B in Silicon Valley-based startups across 3,308 transactions since the beginning of 2009. In 2013, there were 797 exits at a median valuation of $60M, releasing about $50B of value back into the Silicon Valley ecosystem.</p><p> This availability of capital, concentration of entrepreneurs and talent, and a startup culture that is 50+ years in the making, have led to some of the most significant innovations of our time, wildly changing and enriching the way we live our lives&ndash; and transforming how we think about founding and financing companies, building businesses, and achieving success. But all this is not just about the &ldquo;exit,&rdquo; its about innovation, about ingenuity and creativity, about hard work&ndash;  and creating value in the world.</p><p> So, for the candidate interviewing with me for a leadership position, sorry to disappoint: I don&rsquo;t have an &ldquo;exit strategy&rdquo; and never will. But, with a product that provides real value to users, the right vision, mission, strategy, and culture&ndash; and a little bit of luck and good timing&ndash; we can build a great company that does something meaningful&ndash; and have the opportunity to contribute to the Silicon Valley economic machine.</p>",

    "content": "<p> We all know driverless vehicles are coming, but many of us (I think) are having a hard time wrapping our heads around exactly how that's going to work. Google and others have created the impression that human drivers will simply  go away , or become passive back-seat passengers. That's not exactly right. It's close, but it misses the essence of what's happening.What's going to happen, with \"driverless\" buses, cabs, trucks, delivery vans, and private vehicles, is that  the driver's role will change . The driver will still be there, to take over in sticky situations (of which there will obviously be many). Insurance companies are likely to require the presence of a human \"safety backup\" in most scenarios, at least initially, particularly for things like interstate truck convoys. The human driver will not actually touch the controls 99% of the time. He or she will simply monitor all systems, and be ready to intervene in case of an emergency. Which is kind of what pilots do now, in commercial airliners. Professional pilots rarely touch the controls except for takeoff and landing (and emergencies). Autopilots do the rest.So even when big rigs become \"driverless,\" there will still be around 3.5 million professional truck drivers on U.S. roads, but instead of being paid an average of $40,000 a year to drive a truck, they'll be paid $25,000 a year (or whatever the going rate happens to be) to  monitor a truck's systems . The same will happen to bus drivers. And many others. Professional drivers will morph into systems engineers, a fancy name for (low-paid) \"human backup.\"This is job crapification on a massive scale:  millions  of professional drivers, relegated to babysitter duty. And it's set to get underway, in earnest, in as little as five years.</p><li> Nissan: &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/article/finance/2013/08/21/autonomous-vehicles-will-surpass-95-million-in-ann/20700397/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <strong>    In 2020   </strong>    we&rsquo;re talking more autonomous drive capability.

It isn't so much that jobs are going to go away entirely (although some will). It's more likely that jobs will become de-skilled, such that smaller numbers of less-skilled workers will take the place of high numbers of highly skilled workers. The result will be lower average hourly pay. That's what this is all about. What did you think it was about?Technology is not just eliminating jobs (by <u> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintermediation\" target=\"_blank\">  disintermediation </a></u>, or by outright swapping of machines for humans, etc.) but changing the role of humans in the workforce. Our new role is increasingly one of providing support for the machines that can do the actual work better than we can. We'll work for the machines that are putting us out of work.If you enjoyed this post, be sure to see also: <a href=\"http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2015/05/half-of-all-jobs-may-go-away-soon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Half of All Jobs May Go Away Soon </u> .</a>",

    "content": "<p> A while ago, my wife and I renovated our new home, and as part of this grueling process we had to get many quotes from all different kinds of people.  This ranged from window replacement people, plumbers, electrical contractors, painters, tile companies, contractors, fine craftsman, window treatment companies &ndash; the list seemed endless.  After they finally showed up and saw the work, their next job was to deliver a quote (usually by email).  As a sales trainer, the next part seemed pretty straight forward to me &ndash; and that&rsquo;s for them to follow up on their quotes, right? </p><p> Would you believe that over 90% of these people NEVER followed up on their quotes?  I am absolutely amazed by that!  It makes me understand and believe even more in a card I once saw on sales: </p><h3> Sales Statistics <br/>  </h3><p> 48% of sales people never follow up with a prospect</p><p> 25% of sales people make a second contact and stop</p><p> 12% of sales people only make three contacts and stop</p><p> ONLY 10% of sales people make more than three contacts</p><p> 2% of sales are made on the first contact</p><p> 3% of sales are made on the second contact</p><p> 5% of sales are made on the third contact</p><p> 10% of sales are made on the fourth contact</p><p> 80% of sales are made on the fifth to twelfth contact</p><p> Interesting statistics, aren&rsquo;t they?  I always follow up with prospects &ndash; and many, many times as well &ndash; and that practice alone has made me more successful than 90% of my competition.  And after my recent experience with these contractors, I&rsquo;m even more convinced that just following up regularly gives you a significant edge over your competition.  Here is a sample follow-up campaign (emails and phone calls) I use that you can adapt to your sales cycle:</p><p> <strong>  Email #1: </strong></p><p> After my initial phone call with a prospect &ndash; whether they want information or links to my website &ndash; I always send a separate email thanking them for taking the time to speak with me:</p><p> Dear (Prospect&rsquo;s name),</p><p> Thank you for taking a few minutes today to tell me a little about your company and what you are trying to accomplish.  It sounds like if I can help you (repeat their specific needs here), then there might be a fit between our companies. </p><p> I&rsquo;ve sent you over the (brochure, specs, job scope, whatever you promised &ndash; as well as a meeting request) and look forward to our next conversation on (confirm time for next contact).</p><p> If you have any questions before we speak, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to call me back on my direct dial phone number: (Your number).</p><p> Once again, thank you for taking the time to speak with me, and I look forward to continuing our conversation next (week). </p><p> Sincerely,</p><p> (Your Name)</p><p> <strong>  Email #2: </strong></p><p> My next contact comes two days later.  It always includes something that might be of interest to my prospect.  Here is a sample email:</p><p> Dear (Prospect&rsquo;s name),</p><p> I was thinking about you and thought you would enjoy seeing/reading the following article: (Name of an article, company brochure, white paper, something related to them).  I think this is in alignment with what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish.</p><p> Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you.  Once again, my direct phone number is: (Your number). </p><p> Looking forward to speaking with you next (day and time of appointment).</p><p> Sincerely,</p><p> (Your Name)</p><p> <strong>  Email #3: </strong></p><p> My next contact comes with a phone call on the date we have scheduled to speak next (You DID get a specific day and time for your next contact, right?).  Often times before this I will also send out an automatic meeting reminder as well.  My opening for this call is very assumptive and avoids common mistakes such as: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just calling to follow up,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just calling to see if you had time to read the material I sent you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did you have time to go through our website?&rdquo; etc.  Instead your opening call should something like:</p><p> &ldquo;Hi _________, this is ________ ________ with (your company), how&rsquo;s your Monday going?&rdquo;</p><p> You know ________, I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to speaking with you today.  I&rsquo;m sure you looked over the information I sent and probably have some questions, so tell me, where would you like to start?&rdquo;</p><p> Again, always be assumptive, and obviously vary your opening based on whether you&rsquo;re doing a demo (re-qualify in this case), or simply assume they&rsquo;ve done what they committed to doing and then ask a question to get them to reveal what they are thinking.</p><p> So, by now &ndash; by this second conversation &ndash; I&rsquo;ve reached out to my prospect five times! (The first is the email with my information, the second is the email, &ldquo;Thanks for taking the time,&rdquo; the third is the meeting request, the fourth is the next email with additional information or an article, and the fifth is the automatic meeting request.  Including this follow-up call, I&rsquo;ve now reached out to my prospect six times!  But this is just the start&hellip;.</p><p> After my presentation, I get a specific day and time to follow up again, and I will send another email article or white paper in-between this.  And if my prospect isn&rsquo;t available when I call back, I call them several times a day during the week until we connect &ndash; and, of course, I also send emails. </p><p> In addition, any prospect in my pipeline also goes into my Send Out Cards campaign, from which they get a physical greeting card from me in the mail each month until they buy.  (See this amazing card system here: <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sendoutcards.com/mrinsidesales\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.sendoutcards.com/mrinsidesales  </a> </u> )</p><p> On average, between emails and phone conversations and meeting reminders, my prospects get between eight to twelve contacts within the first two weeks.  And then they get a card in the mail each month as well. </p><p> Lastly, if a prospect goes dark during or after this, I always send them my &ldquo;Should I Stay or Should I go&rdquo; email which gets me a response over 65% of the time &ndash; even when every other method fails to get them to react.  Here&rsquo;s what it is:</p><p> Subject line: (Prospect Name) Should I Stay or Should I Go?</p><p> Dear _________,</p><p> I haven't heard back from you and that tells me one of three things:</p><p> 1) You've filled the position or you've already chosen another company for this.</p><p> 2) You're still interested but haven't had the time to get back to me yet.</p><p> 3) You've fallen and can't get up, and in that case please let me know and I'll call 911 for you...</p><p> Please let me know which one it is because I'm starting to worry.</p><p> Honestly, all kidding aside, I understand you're really busy, and the last thing I want to do is be pain in the neck once a week. Whether your schedule has just been too demanding or you've gone another direction, I would appreciate it if you would take a second to let me know so I can follow up accordingly.</p><p> Thank you in advance and I look forward to hearing back from you.</p><p>  Kind regards,&rdquo;</p><p> If this email made you laugh, then think about getting your prospects to laugh as well.  Again, this email gets over 65% of my prospects to email me back and let me know their status.  Try it, it works.</p><p> As you can see, having a follow up system &ndash; and sticking to it &ndash; will put you ahead of over 90% of your competition.  And if you&rsquo;ve qualified a lead properly in the beginning, then this kind of perseverance is often enough to win you the business the majority of the time.</p>",

    "link": "schwab-robo-liberation-for-advisors-or-client-stealing-trojan-horse",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Scott Martin </u> | <a href=\"http://thetrustadvisor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Trust Advisor  </u> </a></p><p> Hoopla around nominally free portfolio population and rebalancing tools exposes deep divide between self-directed &ldquo;mass affluent&rdquo; and high-net-worth advisory cultures.</p><p> Charles Schwab&rsquo;s advisor-focused &ldquo;robot&rdquo; portfolio program only went live last week and hard industry lines are already forming between people who are convinced it&rsquo;s an evolutionary leap and those who think it&rsquo;s an extinction event.</p><p> On one side of the argument, every advisor needs to embrace automation in order to compete. But on the other, fears of a Terminator-style robot revolt run deep, feeding suspicion that the days of human advisors are numbered.</p><p> From everything I can see, the truth is somewhere between hype and hate. And the early numbers indicate that higher-end wealth managers may be pretty far from the &ldquo;hype&rdquo; position.</p><p> Yes, advisors &ndash; especially those who are already racing to the bottom &ndash; need to evolve or find themselves squeezed out of the industry.</p><p> But if you provide a value-added solution that makes extremely wealthy investors happy, you have little to fear here. This particular robot is going to have to work hard to take your place.</p><h3> Giving it away for free?</h3><p> <br/> The core of Schwab robo &ndash; formally known on the advisory side as &ldquo;Institutional Intelligent Portfolios&rdquo; &ndash; boils down to automated asset allocation and selection. Plug in the client&rsquo;s initial risk profile and the tools do the rest.</p><p> In theory it&rsquo;s a great way to liberate the advisor from the rote work of picking the funds, rebalancing and harvesting tax losses along the way. The advisor stays in front of clients and earns the bulk of the fees, while the &ldquo;robot&rdquo; does the brute lifting.</p><p> As a bonus, reasonably big Schwab affiliates get it for free. Those with under $100 million in AUM pay a minimal 10 basis points a year for the privilege.</p><p> But with the firm aggressively promoting the system to its independent RIA partners now, the assets need to add up fairly fast to demonstrate advisor buy-in.</p><p> Bringing the robot into an existing practice is free or so close that the drag is going to be minimal. On those terms, if RIAs don&rsquo;t sign up, it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t see the value or they&rsquo;re worried about hidden strings attached.</p><p> Meanwhile, Schwab is clearly angling to make money on the cash component of those robot-dictated portfolios once interest rates start climbing.  Low rates were a pain point in the last quarterly earnings call because assets parked in the firm&rsquo;s money markets weren&rsquo;t working hard enough.</p><p> With a widely reported floor of 4% allocated to cash across robo portfolios, there&rsquo;s a significant corporate incentive here to help affiliates streamline their client investments along similar lines.</p><p> While a 4% cash cushion feels reasonable for a middle-class retiree like the people who make appointments with Schwab offices, it&rsquo;s a lot of money when you start dealing with true multi-millionaires.</p><p> Taking that money out of the market and letting it molder in minimal-interest banking products isn&rsquo;t exactly going to impress ultra-high-net-worth clients obsessed with performance. And if the platform won&rsquo;t flex to accommodate those clients, the advisors who want to work with them are going to have to keep looking for other solutions.</p><p> The Schwab robot flexes up to a point. It can populate portfolios from a list of 450 ETFs that are already the destination of about 80% of affiliate advisory client allocations and more are undoubtedly on the way.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a great start and already far from a cookie cutter solution. But the independent RIA principals I know are not going to give up the other 20% without a struggle.</p><p> That 20% of the portfolio is usually where advisors differentiate themselves, again in the eyes of HNW clients. It&rsquo;s where you add value on the portfolio side. There&rsquo;s a lot of money riding on that specialized slice of the assets.</p><p> Schwab needs to make sure advisors who work with wealthy investors aren&rsquo;t getting locked into delivering a mass-affluent level of service in exchange for the automated system&rsquo;s convenience.</p><p> Otherwise, to be honest, if the system is worth 10 basis points to smaller RIAs, it&rsquo;s got to give bigger ones at least that much net value. That means &ldquo;doing no harm&rdquo; to the existing book and freeing up a lot of resources to prospect additional accounts.</p><p> Figure a hypothetical HNW advisor charges 100 basis points now to do everything because it takes up 100% of his or her time. Freeing up the equivalent of 10 of those basis points might open up 4 or 5 hours a week to prospect if the Schwab system is a good deal.</p><p> Do you spend that much time on initial asset allocation, rebalancing and tax loss harvesting now? If so, sacrificing the flexibility may turn out to be a great trade.</p><h3> Not the only game in town</h3><p> <br/> A lot of the hype around this program also focuses around how it&rsquo;s head and shoulders better than existing &ldquo;robot advisor&rdquo; platforms designed for the mass affluent market.</p><p> Advisors, on the other hand, have had access to automated rebalancing and model portfolios for a long time now. Automation and outsourcing can unlock enormous growth and profitability as long as the results are a perfect fit for the existing business.</p><p> All of this technology is a known quantity for firms with the scale and the vision to reach for it, and as the industry evolves the reasons not to embrace one solution or another become less compelling as the barriers to entry fall.</p><p> Schwab affiliates probably need to bring at least one &ldquo;robot&rdquo; into the office. I&rsquo;m just not convinced yet that the Institutional Intelligent Portfolio is that robot. So I asked around.</p><p> &ldquo;Handing parts of the operational platform to any automated &lsquo;robot&rsquo; system is probably better than nothing, but advisors who truly want to work with high-net-worth clientele probably need a little more than a cookie cutter <br/> solution,&rdquo; Cory Kendall, national sales manager at FTJ FundChoice, told me.</p><p> FTJ has built a system that provides capabilities comparable to what Schwab is offering, but when it goes live in a few days it will be a true state-of-the-art open-architecture investment platform: managed accounts as well as ETFs, elite outside managers, all bundled in a front-to-back white-label environment.</p><p> While clients will never know that you&rsquo;re not doing all the heavy lifting, you&rsquo;re free to intervene with the &ldquo;robotic&rdquo; protocols at any moment. That&rsquo;s standard operating procedure in the world of high-net-worth asset management programs.</p><p> Mass-market robots are wonderful because they make it possible to deliver professional advice to the middle class on a profitable basis. FTJ and firms like it have evolved to deepen already-profitable HNW relationships, Kendall says. <br/> &ldquo;The goal here is not to race to the bottom by cutting costs through automation,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;The goal is to deliver richer, more personalized service to <br/> more clients.&rdquo;</p><h3> Channel conflict?</h3><p> <br/> In-house advisors weren&rsquo;t exactly eager to promote the opportunity this spring when the program initially rolled out to Schwab&rsquo;s self-directed investor clients.</p><p> The first investor-facing incarnation of the automated portfolio program amassed about $1.5 billion in its first six-week recruiting period, which looks impressive until you set that number alongside the $2.5 trillion on the Schwab broker platform.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: an adoption rate north of $35 million a day for what amounts to a new channel is pretty amazing for just about everyone but one of the biggest brokerage firms in history.</p><p> But far from a surge of accounts embracing the robot, that $1.5 billion is practically a rounding error. And with $34 billion coming to the firm&rsquo;s traditional advisory and self-directed channels across the quarter, a thousand new accounts in six weeks don&rsquo;t exactly move the needle either.</p><p> All in all, only about 11% to 12% of the initial conversions came from in-house fee-based advisory accounts. That&rsquo;s maybe $180 million in assets, which might represent two independent RIA partners.</p><p> Another telling detail is account size. The robot is serving big fish by Schwab standards, but the average early adopter on the platform weighed in at around $80,000 in assets.</p><p> These aren&rsquo;t high-net-worth investors. Once again, we&rsquo;re seeing mass affluent accounts migrate to a format that I suspect was built with them in mind.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve seen Schwab have to balance its in-house &ldquo;consulting&rdquo; model that serves those accounts with its third-party RIA affiliates&rsquo; high-net-worth business in the past.</p><p> I&rsquo;d be shocked if Schwab executives didn&rsquo;t covet the RIA clientele. A few years ago, their decision to start a network of franchised advisory offices was seen as covert competition with the RIAs.</p><p> Even though the push for franchises came from the brokerage side of the company, it still raised a lot of hackles. Advisors like working with Schwab as long as the custodian refuses to cannibalize their business and the brokerage network can&rsquo;t compete head to head for clients.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve heard a little grousing that the robot will learn about the HNW market from the advisors it works &ldquo;with,&rdquo; ultimately passing that information back to the parent company as the system matures.</p><p> I think that&rsquo;s a conspiracy theory, but it just shows how fragile the relationship is. Advisors know the HNW market. Schwab&rsquo;s discount brokerage reps and consultants would love to get into that business because they know that the robots can already do their job faster, better and more cheaply.</p><p> Either way, applying a set of tools built for the discount brokerage client to HNW investors may not be the solution anyone was hoping to see. But I&rsquo;d be happy to be proved wrong.</p><p> And for all the advisors who were already feeling the competitive pressure from platforms like Schwab and Merrill Edge: time is getting short to evolve or race to the bottom.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Sadly, some people are so entrenched in seeing the negative side of things that they leave zero room for positive things to grow.  People like this inhabit our families, work environments and social circles.  It can be emotionally draining just being around them, and you must be careful because their negative attitudes and opinions are venomous and contagious.  Negativity perpetuates itself, breeds dissatisfaction and clutters the mind.  And when the mind is cluttered with negativity, happiness is hard to come by.</p><p> Ignore these people and move on from them when you must.  Seriously, be strong and know when enough is enough!  Letting go of negative people doesn&rsquo;t mean you hate them, or that you wish them harm; it just means you care about your own well-being.  Because every time you subtract negative from your life, you make room for more positive.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t live a positive life around negative people.</p><p> Here are seven such people you might need to put on your ignore list:</p><p> <strong>  1.  The hopelessly hostile drama queen. </strong> <br/> <br/> Some people love to stir up controversy and drama for no apparent reason.  Don&rsquo;t buy in to their propaganda.  Stay out of other people&rsquo;s drama and don&rsquo;t needlessly create your own.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t spew hostile words at someone who spews them at you.  Keep your composure and replace the stink of confrontation with the fragrance of resolution.  The louder the opposition wants to yell, and the more drama they want to stir, the calmer and more confidently you need to think and speak.  Don&rsquo;t let them get to you.Be an example of a pure existence; ignore their outlandish antics and focus onkindness.  Communicate and express yourself from a place of peace, from a place of love, with the best intentions.  Use your voice for good &ndash; to inspire, to encourage, to educate, and to spread the notions of compassion and understanding.</p><p> When someone insists on foisting their hostility and drama on you, ignore them and walk away.</p><p> <strong>  2.  The person you have failed to please a hundred times before. </strong></p><p> Some people are impossible to please; you will not be able to break through to them no matter what you do.  Accept this harsh as a fact of life.Throughout your lifetime some people will discredit you, disrespect you and treat you poorly for no apparent reason at all.  Don&rsquo;t consume yourself with trying to change them or win their approval.  And don&rsquo;t make any space in your heart to hate them.  Simply walk away and let karma deal with the things they do, because any bit of time you spend on them will be wasted, and any bit of hate and aggravation in your heart will only hurt you.</p><p> <strong>  3.  The naysayer who always dumps on your dreams. </strong> <br/> <br/> Stop giving credit to those who discredit your dreams.  These people are punishing your potential by slowly extinguishing your inner flame with their watered down vision of what you are capable of achieving.</p><p> If you give in and let their negativity convince you of who you are, their madness will wither you away.  You will morph into who they say you are, rather than living honestly as yourself.  In this way, these people will steal your life from you.  You will lose track of where their opinion ends and your reality begins.  Their fiction will become your life&rsquo;s story.What you&rsquo;re capable of is not a function of what others think is possible for you.  So look beyond their presumptions and mental limitations, and connect with your own best vision of what YOU are capable of and how YOUR life can be.  Life, after all, is an open-ended journey, and 99% what you achieve comes directly from what you work to achieve on a daily basis.</p><p> <strong>  4.  The manipulator. </strong> <br/> <br/> Beware of manipulators, or bullies, who try to use their negativity to intimidate and manipulate your thoughts.  If you observe them from a distance, you will realize that these people are often overly self-referential.  In other words, the people around them (YOU) fit into their plan simply based on how they can be used or manipulated for their own personal gain. These people routinely prioritize their own feelings and needs over and above everyone else&rsquo;s.  They will demand that you bend over to help them, but if, heaven forbid, you need help, they will not be able to stand it. Bottom line:  Some people will say and do anything, thoughtlessly, to get others to do what they want them to do.  Do not accept this behavior as normal.  When someone tries to bully you, stand up for yourself and say, &ldquo;Not so fast, buddy!  Your delusion of superiority is your problem, not mine.&rdquo;  And if they refuse to reason with you, walk away without a fight.</p><p> <strong>  5.  The stubborn one who insists you should be someone else. </strong> <br/> <br/> In the long run, it&rsquo;s always better to be disrespected for who you are than respected for who you are not.  In fact, the only relationships that work well are the ones that make you a better person without changing you into someone other than yourself, and without preventing you from outgrowing the person you used to be. Unfortunately, families and old friends often fail to recognize how you&rsquo;ve changed and grown over the years.  They also tend to label you in an unfair way based on who you used to be; and it&rsquo;s easy to end up conforming to these labels because you remember when they were true.  For example, &ldquo;Oh, Marc always has his head in the clouds,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Angel never could focus on anything for very long.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s important to remember is that you&rsquo;re the only person in the world who knows what&rsquo;s happening inside your head right now.  People who don&rsquo;t know you well may assume you&rsquo;re someone else entirely.  And people who think they know you well may have pigeonholed you &ndash; but you know there&rsquo;s more to you than what they see.</p><p> When you ignore their opinions and decide to be who you are, instead of who they want you to be, you open yourself up to real love, real happiness, and real success.  There is no need to put on a mask.  There is no need to pretend to be someone you&rsquo;re not. You don&rsquo;t have control over what others think about you, but you do have control over how you decide to internalize their opinions.  Leave them to their own judgments.  Don&rsquo;t feel threatened and don&rsquo;t conform just to please them.  Let people love you for who you are, and not for who they want you to be.  Or let them walk away if they choose.  They can&rsquo;t harm you either way; it&rsquo;s their understanding that is faulty, not yours.</p><p> <strong>  6.  The unforgiving friend who refuses to forgive you for your mistakes. </strong> <br/> <br/> The most honorable thing is not to never make mistakes, but to admit to them when you do make them, and then to follow through and do your best to make the wrong things right.</p><p> Mistakes are part of growing.  They are a natural part of every worthwhile endeavor. If someone refuses to support you as you grow beyond your past mistakes, they are now the one that&rsquo;s making a mistake.  Holding on to the unchangeable past is a waste of energy and serves no purpose in creating a better day today.  If someone continuously judges you by your past, holds it against you, and refuses to forgive you, you might have to repair your present and future by leaving them behind.</p><p> <strong>  7.  The inner critic. </strong></p><p> Boom!  Wake-up call!  Yes, sadly, the inner critic is inside YOU.</p><p> Unrelenting self-criticism often goes hand in hand with unhappiness and anxiety, and it&rsquo;s completely unjustified.  There is no reason to be your own biggest critic &ndash; to harp on yourself for your shortcomings.  All you really need is the courage to be yourself.  Your real value is rooted in who you are, not who you aren&rsquo;t. The flaws you often see in yourself are only the qualities of your own individuality.  There is something unique and special about you.  You are different.  You will never be as good as someone else, and they will never be as good as you.  Just as no two snowflakes are alike, your fingerprints are different from every other being on Earth.  You are meant to be different.  You are here to express who you are and enjoy what you have at this very moment.  When you accept this, there is no reason to compare yourself to someone or something you aren&rsquo;t.  There is nothing for the inner critic to complain about. Every morning when you wake up, think of three things that are going well in YOUR life at the moment.  As you fall asleep every night, fill your mind with an appreciation for all the small things that went well during the day.  Examine the goodness that is YOUR life, and let your inner critic overhear the five-star reviews about YOU.</p><p> <strong>  Afterthoughts </strong> <br/> <br/> When people undermine your dreams, predict your doom, criticize you, and generally resist the truth about who you are, remember, they&rsquo;re telling you their own sad story, not yours.  They&rsquo;re dumping their own doubts into the air.  Ignore them. If the person doing this is you (your inner critic), try giving up all the thoughts and contemplations that make you feel bad, or even just some of them, for the rest of the day.  See how doing that changes your life.  You don&rsquo;t need these negative thoughts.  All they have ever given you is a false self that suffers for no reason. </p>",

    "content": "<p> When my friends come to me for advice and I give it to them, I often hear:</p><li> Oh, that won&rsquo;t work because&hellip; </li><li> I tried something like that once&hellip; </li><li> or my personal favorite,  I don&rsquo;t have enough time  <br/> (Really? Cause Facebook told me you were up til 1 playing Candy Crush, Seriously?!) <br/>  </li><p> And despite my frustration, I am the first to admit that just like them, I can rationalize and find an excuse for anything I don&rsquo;t want to do. Like most people, I'm only ready to change when there's a good enough reason to do so. And it doesn't just have to be a rock-bottom. When I have a goal I'm super excited about, I&rsquo;m willing to do what it takes. I&rsquo;m willing to stop self-sabotaging, take a good look at myself, and clean house. Literally.</p><p> And that gets me to today's topic.</p><p> A lot of people write in and ask me about how I started Aligned Holistics. These readers fall into 2 camps:</p><li> They want to know all the juicy details of how I healed my Depression, ADHD, etc.</li><li> They want to pursue a goal (like a business), but can&rsquo;t seem to find the time to make it happen. <br/>  </li><p> The truth is that to some degree, the two go hand-in-hand. See, a lot of creating a life I love (&amp; getting off the meds!) was creating systems that supported that. Whether it be self-care, organization, or time management, I needed to create structure to get out of my own way and let the magic happen.</p><p> I could write an entire book on how to start a business doing what you love (note to self-do that!) But since blogs are about brevity, I want to share the top 3 tips that helped me to succeed.</p><h3> 3 Tips To Make It Happen: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Organize Your Space. </strong></p><p> Back when my ADHD was running the show, I spent way too much time sorting through papers, looking for keys, and getting distracted by items strewn on my countertop. My disorganized space led to a pervasive low-level anxiety that made my home a stressful work environment. Not surprisingly, with all the reminders of things that needed to be put away (without a place to put them), I didn&rsquo;t get much done. So I met with an ADHD coach (yes, even coaches need coaches) and this was the first thing she told me.</p><p> <strong>  Where to start: </strong>  Create an exit station. Located near your door, this centralized location should house your keys, sunglasses, wallet, mail, gym pass, etc. It should be home to everything you'd grab on your way out the door. I also use it to post affirmations or intentions so I have a positive note to start my day.</p><p> <strong>  2. Throw Things Out.  </strong></p><p> I'm sure you've heard this before, but it bears repeating until you get rid of that sweater you haven't worn in a year, the papers you could have scanned and trashed, and the broken belt that you swear you'll get fixed but haven't yet. If it's taking up space in your home, it's taking up space in your mind. For many years I held onto things for \"sentimental value.\" And then I realized that the item is not the same as what it represents. For example, last week I got a thoughtful card from a friend. Today I threw it out. That It doesn't mean that I don't value the person who sent it to me, it just means that NYC real-estate is at a premium and so is my mental capacity. To make this easier (and eliminate any guilt you may feel), snap a picture with your phone first.</p><p> <strong>  Where to start: </strong>  If you haven't used it in the past year, throw it out.</p><p> <strong>  3. Pick 3 Wins. </strong></p><p> If I could give any piece of advice to my fellow entrepreneurs, it would be this: Pick the 3 things you MUST accomplish for the day and prioritize them. When I work with my 1-on-1 clients, I'm often asked, \"But how do I know which 3 to pick? Why only 3?\" Since my clients and I set goals together, I respond by teaching them to filter their actions by looking at their to-do list and saying \"Will this action get me closer to or further from my goal?\" If it gets you to your goal, it makes the cut. I always say start with 3 small wins. Anything you do after that is extra credit. </p><p> <strong>  Where to start: </strong>  Each morning, complete the following sentence, \"If I only get these 3 things done, I'll feel good about what I accomplished today.\" Then, do them!</p>",

Their focus is on &ldquo;Millennial Money Mavens&rdquo; who are building careers and wealth in addition to &ldquo;Achieving Women&rdquo; who are looking to thrive in retirement. By zeroing in on the two tribal markets they were able to build an event program that was more appealing to that particular market.</p><p> Along they way they have fine-tuned this process to have it require less time and energy, but ensure every component is working together to more effectively brand themselves as the Mother Daughter Duo for women young and old. This has all been done by:</p><li> Strategically adjusting their company-sponsored presentations reducing the more technical slides and deleting slides all together to create more opportunities to engage the women in discussions.</li><li> Hosting their proprietary events at their branch once a month to provide another opportunity to build credibility and trust.</li><li> Creating a calendar of events that has become their primary marketing tool, which promotes and reinforces their message brand and commitment to educating and engaging women. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  But here is what makes this process brilliant.  </strong></p><p> When the young millennia&rsquo;s learn that Morgan and Cindy also focus on Achieving Women they are inspired to encourage their mothers to attend the next event. When the Achieving Women realize The Mother Daughter Duo also work with millennial&rsquo;s the mothers are inspired to share and encourage their daughters to become involved.  <strong>  This marketing plan has created a multi-generational practice and a dynamic source of referrals that is fun, easy and effortless but more importantly will last for generations to come. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Sponsored by Fidelity Investments </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t look now, but the millennials (also known as Generation Y) will soon be making their mark in the workplace. This generation, born between 1980 and 2000, is coming of age and is projected to make up 50% of the workforce by 2020. <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1] </a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the people who manage them in the workplace&mdash;typically baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) or generation X-ers (born between 1965 and 1979)&mdash;millennials can present new challenges. If you have ever found yourself starting a sentence with the phrase &ldquo;kids today just don&rsquo;t&rdquo; or &ldquo;young people today just don&rsquo;t&rdquo; then it&rsquo;s likely that you are among those who are facing these challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;The common frustration I have heard about younger millennials is what senior people in the workplace call the &ldquo;work ethic,&rdquo; says Cam Marston, the founder of Generational Insights in Mobile, Ala., and author of The Gen-Savvy Financial Advisor. &ldquo;Some millennials tend to place a high value on work-life balance, so they are generally more likely to come to work on time and leave on time.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMillennials&rsquo; work habits, communications style, and expectations sometimes clash with those who entered the financial services industry decades ago, says Caleb Brown, a partner at New Planner Recruiting, LLC in Athens, GA. When the oldest baby boomers first began their careers in the mid-1960s, many managers adopted a military management style that in some cases was modeled on their own experience in World War II. New employees were expected to come in early, stay late, toe the line and not ask questions. While that approach may have worked 50 years ago, Brown says this type of authoritative approach is unlikely to resonate with most young employees today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&ldquo;The first thing that firm owners need to do is take some of what they learned from how their first manager treated them when they started their careers and throw that out the window,&rdquo; says Brown.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe says that advisors may want to consider focusing instead on creating a collaborative environment where millennials will feel like they are part of a team and understand the importance of their role on the team.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday, 43 percent of financial advisors are age 55 or older and only 12 percent are under the age of 33. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [2] </a> Therefore, many advisory firms will need to attract younger employees who can help them build a bridge to their clients&rsquo; adult children and other young investors who are starting to build wealth. In fact, the future of many advisory firms may depend on employees from the millennial generation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith this challenge in mind, we spoke with third-party recruiters, human resources professionals, and researchers to learn more about millennials&rsquo; unique traits and potential ways to motivate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Read the full article <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/292549920;120432613;z\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u> here </u> </a> . </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please view the white papers: &ldquo; <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/292549079;120432613;e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u> Recruiting Redefined </u> </a> &rdquo;; &ldquo; <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/292549156;120432613;a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u> 2013 Fidelity&reg; Millionaire Outlook Executive Summary: Gen X/Y Millionaires Not Sitting Idle </u> </a> &rdquo; and &ldquo; <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/292549715;120432613;b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u> Take the Quiz: Perspectives on the looming advisor talent shortage </u> </a> &rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a> Based on research by Cerulli Associates. <a href=\"http://www.fa-mag.com/news/43--of-all-advisors-are-approaching-retirement--says-cerulli-16661.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.fa-mag.com/news/43--of-all-advisors-are-approaching-retirement--says-cerulli-16661.html</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a> Millennials Survey: &ldquo;Millennials at work: Reshaping the workplace&quot;, PwC, http://www.pwc.ru/en/hr-consulting/publications/millenials-survey.jhtml?vm=r&amp;s=1<br />\r\n<strong>DISCLOSURES</strong>For Investment Professional use only.

    "content": "<p> It can be hard to avoid the big mistakes consultants make if you&rsquo;re blind to the potholes. I&rsquo;m sharing my own messy story to help you avoid some of the dips in the road in which I tripped and faltered.</p><p> Any consultant will tell you, consulting can be a lot of fun and also at times a very chaotic affair. You&rsquo;re walking the line of project or program ownership while remaining an outsider. It&rsquo;s your project, but you were hired to further your client&rsquo;s success; your success is a by-product.</p><p> Years ago, I had the  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/how-to-lead-virtual-teams/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   privilege of working on a team  </a> </u>  that designed, developed and implemented one of the largest live theater-based business simulations in history for a large pharmaceutical company. Our core team collectively put in thousands of hours of work, not including all of the contractors we hired for the training itself. The pressure was on to exceed expectations and create a meaningful learning experience.</p><p> We had insane logistics to manage and had hired over 100 actors to play doctors to train pharmaceutical sales reps for a new drug launch. It was our go-live weekend at the Alamodome in San Antonio, and everything came down to this three-day event.</p><p> I handled the hiring and preparation of the actors while my colleagues covered other critical pieces of the launch. These actors had no lines to memorize; it was all on-the-fly improv, and they had to pass as established doctors in cardiology and other specializations too.</p><p> Working with our casting agent, we held auditions in NYC and LA and hired an extremely smart and talented group of actors who were committed to their parts. I was incredibly proud of their results &ndash; they knocked it out of the park. However, this project was not really about the actors and how well they did; it was about the sales reps who needed to be prepared to go-live in the market the following week.</p><p> Not unexpectedly, during the three-day business simulation, some of the sales reps were superstars and others were challenged. A few of the reps stammered their way through the mock sales calls and struggled to master the material. Luckily, they had a coach observing every call to immediately engage them in the learning and make improvements over the next few days in the training. However, the problem was, the actors thought that the struggling reps were hysterical and shared their stories with our client.</p><p> I was worried that the actors were only telling the bad stories, the biggest flubs, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/work-someone-hate/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the worst experiences  </a> </u> . They weren&rsquo;t sharing stories about the great reps who were coming through the simulation and were well prepared to market the newest drug in their portfolio. To me, it was beginning to sound like all of the reps were a mess and not just a small subset.</p><p> After the first day of the training, I stood in the front of the room to tell the actors that I wanted them to not only share the bad with our client, but also the good. Yes, flubs are funny but we want to  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/rekindle-your-confidence-and-creativity-through-self-mentoring/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   help build confidence  </a> </u>  too. A little less emphasis on the mess-ups would be great.</p><p> Later that evening the senior leader from my company came to see me; the client wanted me removed from the program. I was shocked and unbelievably sad. When I asked why, he told me it was because I advised the actors to no longer say anything bad, stopping the client from getting a realistic picture.</p><p> No! No, no, no!</p><p> I wanted balance. Okay, maybe a little more weight on the good side, but I never asked them to stop completely sharing the gaffes. I immediately asked how I could make it right and was told I could not.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what I learned from this experience, and from the decades of consulting that followed, are some the big mistakes consultants make. Are you making the same missteps?</p><h3> Three Big Mistakes Consultants Make:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Owning the Work and Taking All of the Credit </strong></p><p> I had a key client contact but truly felt like this program was my baby. I kept him in the loop at a high level, but he was never in the weeds. I thought he was happy. Turns out, working with Equity Actors, some of whom were famous, was sexy and the client wanted to feel the love. The program was his, not mine, and I should have made him the star of the show.</p><p> After the program wrapped, and I left the project, he took over as the primary point of contact and owned the relationships with the actors and the directors. He was much happier doing the fun stuff that he saw me doing for the past year.</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/the-most-powerful-question-a-leader-can-ask/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I could have asked  </a> </u>  how he wanted to be involved. (Even if it was just socializing with the actors and letting him be in the spotlight)</li><li> I could have given him far more credit despite the fact that I was doing the work. (He was the employee; not me.)</li><li> I could have invited him, even when he didn&rsquo;t ask and seemed too busy. (The choice was his; not mine) <br/>  </li><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Consultants%3A+Never+forget+your+client+is+the+star+of+the+show%2C+not+you.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/mistakes-consultants-make/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Consultants: Never forget your client is the star of the show, not you.  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  Offering One Sided Insights / Feedback </strong></p><p> Yes, I encouraged the actors to share more of the good and less of the bad, but it wasn&rsquo;t all or nothing. Clients want to hear that things are going well, but also deserve to hear the truth and  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leadership-beyond-illusion-of-perfection/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   less than perfect results too  </a> </u> . Yes, we can tell our clients that we&rsquo;re managing them, there&rsquo;s a plan and it&rsquo;s under control &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t mean that consultants should pretend that everything&rsquo;s perfect when it&rsquo;s not.</p><p> Sharing the challenges opens up the client &ndash; consultant relationship to craft and implement solutions. It can be hard as a consultant to have access to the same information and resources as employee leadership. It&rsquo;s important to remember that they want the program to succeed as much if not more than you do.</p><li> I could have taken responsibility for sharing the good and the bad too. (If I wanted balance, I could&rsquo;ve led the way)</li><li> I could have asked the client to share what feedback he was hearing and facilitated a discussion with the larger team. (Choosing discussion over assumptions.)</li><li> I could have partnered with the client to ensure that the sales reps who were struggling were well supported and do reconnaissance to ensure that they were not all in a single region. (Fact-finding to deepen our shared understanding!) <br/>  </li><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Consultants%3A+Don%27t+pretend+everything%E2%80%99s+perfect+if+it%E2%80%99s+not.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/mistakes-consultants-make/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Consultants: Don&rsquo;t pretend everything&rsquo;s perfect if it&rsquo;s not.  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  Never Underestimate the Speed of Whisper Down the Lane   </strong></p><p> I simply asked the actors to share less bad and offer more good. It took only a few hours for the request to get bastardized through a lightning fast round of whisper down the lane. Quickly, it went to NEVER share bad, ONLY share good.</p><p> People talk and even when you think you are having a closed door meeting, expect that when people leave through the open door, the information will get out. As a consultant, it&rsquo;s critical to always loop back with your client instead of letting the  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/when-are-leaders-needed-most/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   rumor mill  </u>    </a> do the work for you. It&rsquo;s much harder to say &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; than to get in front of any potential issues.</p><li> I could have included the client in the meeting, eliminating potential misunderstanding. (Who was I really trying to protect?)</li><li> I could have looped back with my client to debrief the meeting and tell him what I said. (If out of line, it could have been corrected asap)</li><li> I could have asked the actors to speak to me if they were unsure of my feedback or direction. (The result may have been the same, but it never hurts to ask.) <br/>  </li><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Consultants%3A+Closed+door+meetings+have+doors+that+ultimately+open.+Keep+your+client+in+the+loop.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/mistakes-consultants-make/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Consultants: Closed door meetings have doors that ultimately open. Keep your client in the loop  </u>  . </a></p><p> <strong>  The two things that I did on this program that were definitely not mistakes were: </strong></p><p> 1) Giving it my all and tirelessly working in service of the client&rsquo;s success.</p><p> 2)  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leaders-say-sorry-losers-stay-silent/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Apologizing to the client  </u>    </a> and directly asking how I could make it right. <br/> <br/> What advice do you have for other consultants or business owners to avoid some of the pitfalls that you&rsquo;ve discovered in your career?</p>",

    "content": "<p> There is this sentiment in the world of business and HR that people who are intrinsically-driven and high-performing are the only people we need to power our companies. In fact, I have observed on several occasions the disdain of a hiring manager and business partner who were less than enthused to consider an internal employee who &ldquo;met performance standards&rdquo; consistently but never exceeded them during their tenure with the company. Again, last week at the  <u>  Employee Engagement Awards </u>  I overheard a few one-liners that let me know that companies are so focused on culture fit and the &ldquo;outliers&rdquo; that they are most certainly disenfranchising the remaining, but extremely vital portion of their workforce.</p><h3> Workforce distribution</h3><p> <br/> If we assume that our workforces resemble a normal distribution of people, we can all agree that the top performers are like your top 5%. Your operational people- the &ldquo;meets standards&rdquo; folks are probably about 70% of the workforce- with the lower 5% being your &ldquo;below standards&rdquo; crowd. You can&rsquo;t also forget about the 20% that are &ldquo;above average&rdquo; performers and just on the cusp of being a top performer. This is the normal distribution of the typical workforce- yet we often focus our efforts on the smallest group and perhaps the least important employees.</p><h3> The &ldquo;middle&rdquo; needs more&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Before you bite my head off&ndash;consider this: high-performing employees are revered because they generally can come into an organization and hit the ground working without any training or operational downtime. They can do this because they are driven, self-directed and usually don&rsquo;t require hand-holding to accomplish their tasks.  The operational folks are a little different. In many cases, they need to know what they are doing and need specific direction on how to get things done. They can be self-directed, but they do so only when they are clear on your expectations, wants and needs. For all intents and purposes, these are the people that keep companies running. They understand the SOP&rsquo;s of the organization and won&rsquo;t necessarily scoff at the routineness of their jobs. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need this part of your work population to be over-achievers or visionaries. You simply need them to know their jobs well and to execute accordingly.</p><h3> The Skills Gap</h3><p> <br/> Without these people your business can&rsquo;t run. No person is more important than the other in an organization. However, if you step back and look at things from a talent management and development standpoint your &ldquo;meets standards&rdquo; people are really the ones that need the most attention.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emad-rizkalla/not-investing-in-employee_b_5545222.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   According to a study by IBM  </a> </u> , companies lose 10-30% of their capabilities per year as a result of not providing training and development opportunities. The average company loses 41% of their staff three years in. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that we are leaving talent behind. We aren&rsquo;t ensuring that every employee is given a chance to succeed and thrive in their own right. We have traded investing in our employees for the short-term mirage of productivity.</p><p> As daunting as it may sound, your company&rsquo;s success is predicated on our ability to foster an environment where no talent is left behind. It isn&rsquo;t just about the top performers that can help you envision the future- it is also about every person in between that shows up with interest, dedication and loyalty keeping the company afloat.</p><p> Collectively we need some basic guidance to work with so we can build talent management programs that take everyone into consideration. Here are some considerations:</p><li> <strong>  Stop labeling people. </strong> Whether it is &ldquo;high-potential&rdquo; or &ldquo;low-potential&rdquo; no good can come from throwing employees into these buckets. Start seeing every employee as having potential. Find ways to elicit their potential by providing meaningful work experiences and valuing their input regarding their career aspirations.</li><li> <strong>  Get back to training and development.  </strong> The T&amp;D vacation is over. If your excuse is that you are far too busy and don&rsquo;t have time to train- think again. Companies that invest in training and development reap the benefits of increased productivity, customer satisfaction, and lower turnover.</li><li> <strong>  Think long-term. </strong>  I get it. The faster you move the more profitable you are. That is a short-term mindset. Your focus should be on identifying and mapping the skills of your entire staff so you know who to call on when projects, needs and opportunities arise. <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s all about knowing what pieces to the puzzle you have. If you know where to fit your employees you can continue to complete the puzzle. If you don&rsquo;t know what pieces you have there will always be a skills gap that stands between your company and what you hope to achieve.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In a landmark ruling on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled (in a 5-4 decision) that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is unconstitutional. As such, the Supreme Court ruling makes same-sex marriage a legal right nationwide.</p><h3> This ruling by the Supreme Court clearly has wide reaching implications.</h3><p> <br/> With respect to Social Security benefits specifically, this ruling has significant implications for same-sex couples. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is no longer prevented from recognizing same-sex marriages in determining entitlement to Social Security benefits or eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments. As we speak, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is working closely with the Department of Justice to develop and implement additional policy and processing instructions to provide same-sex couples access to all the same benefits as heterosexual couples.</p><p> If you are a same-sex couple and believe you may be eligible for retirement, spousal or survivors benefits, the SSA encourages you to apply now to protect you against the loss of any potential benefits. By applying for eligible benefits now you can secure your filing date and, as such, settlement of any claims will go back to that filing date.</p><p> The decision on same-sex marriage that was just handed down by the Supreme Court has seismic implications for what's right and fair and good for married couples who love each other, are committed to each other and who also happen to be gay. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority in this historic decision. Marriage is a \"keystone of our social order\", Justice Kennedy said, adding that the plaintiffs in this case were seeking \"equal dignity in the eyes of the law\".  With that, same-same couples will now be eligible for all benefits available to any married couple.</p><p> As I wrote in my blog just two short weeks ago, it was time for all 50 states to recognize the rights and privileges of same sex couples and to provide them with all the social security benefits afforded heterosexual couples. Well, that day has arrived!  It's more than just a civil rights victory for same-sex couples across the country, it's also an important financial win.  In some cases, as with heterosexual couples, social security spousal and survivor benefits may be a lifeline keeping couples and surviving spouses from a life of poverty.</p><p> The Supreme Court on this same day in 2013 struck down a law that prevented the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage. But same-sex marriage was still banned in 13 states: Arkansas, Kentucky, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, Texas and Tennessee.  However, once this latest Supreme Court's ruling takes effect in two weeks, those states must also recognize same-sex couples who were married in a state where it was already legal.  Those states must also issue marriage licenses to couples who want to get married now.</p><p> With the Supreme Court's decision recognizing same-sex marriage as a constitutional right, those couples will be able to use the same Social Security income maximization strategies available to heterosexual couples. These strategies include spousal, ex-spousal, disability and survivor benefits which can result in significant increases in lifetime social security benefits.  The New York Times  estimated that, before this Supreme Court ruling, a same-sex couple would receive anywhere from $41,000 - $468,000 in reduced benefits when compared to a heterosexual couple! Clearly, this is an enormous win, financially and otherwise, for same-sex couples.</p><h3> This is not just a great day for same-sex couples in America.</h3><p> <br/> The Supreme Court ruling sends a signal to the world that America is a country where the goals of equality, dignity, fairness and justice apply to all Americans. Confirming the legal right to marry under the law also affords same-sex couples with the financial rights and benefits within the social security system that they paid into and will likely need in navigating the economic challenges of retirement; the same challenges faced by all Americans who are approaching or are in retirement today.</p>",

    "title": "A Lesson Abroad: What RIAs Can Learn From a Hike to Machu Picchu",
    "link": "a-lesson-abroad-what-rias-can-learn-from-a-hike-to-machu-picchu",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Karyn Piechule </p><p> In May, I completed a hike across Peru&rsquo;s Inca Trail. For four days and three nights, I trekked 28 miles to Machu Picchu, a mysterious 15-century Incan citadel that&rsquo;s nestled in the Andes Mountains.</p><p> It was the trip of a lifetime, but it wasn&rsquo;t until I returned (getting my head out of the clouds&mdash;literally), that I realized the hike had many connections to leadership, success and business acumen. Below, are three lessons that RIAs can learn from this adventure abroad:</p><li> <strong>  Winning a client can be like climbing a mountain, but it doesn&rsquo;t start or stop there. </strong>  The success of the hike was largely dependent on the prep time that was put in before even landing in Peru. Hours of research were devoted to details that could have been a &ldquo;make or break&rdquo; element on the trek (for example, how many liters of water to carry per day, medicine to have on hand, the perfect combination of clothing while not overpacking, etc.). The preparation required before I even laced up my boots and started hiking was time consuming but vital. For RIAs, this same mentality is necessary to win clients and grow the firm&rsquo;s assets. There is considerable time and work that goes into targeting prospective clients. It&rsquo;s important to be efficient, but use tools like a PR team and/or social media to bolster your image in the community, or work on fine-turning your referral efforts with current clients or industry peers to help spread the word about  your business and what kind of clients you are looking for. When you have won a client, it can feel like you&rsquo;ve reached the top of a mountain, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near over just because you&rsquo;ve reached the summit. Appreciate the prep-time and effort that went into winning the client, and be ready to put the same dedication toward forging a long-term relationship with them to achieve their financial goals and objectives.</li><li> <strong>  Recognize individual&rsquo;s strengths and how they fit into an organization&rsquo;s greater good. </strong>  Our trek looked like a traveling circus &ndash; 19 hikers, three tour guides, a handful of cooks and about a dozen porters. Everyone had a focus and essentially, a job. The hikers&rsquo; focus was to do just that&hellip; hike. Guides managed the group and provided historical information along the way, the cooks fed and nourished the entire group, and the porters would get supplies (tents, sleeping bags, pots and pans, etc.) to each day&rsquo;s base camp location. To get the entire group from point A to B before nightfall was a streamlined and efficient effort that relied on everyone&rsquo;s individual strengths and working together for the greater good of the group. The same approach can be applied to RIAs. It&rsquo;s vital to recognize individuals&rsquo; strengths, but the end goal is the same: Continuing on the path to success. As an advisor, your skill set and focus is primarily on client relations and overall office management, while for example, your PR team is focused on messaging and building your presence in the media. Find others that can complement your business efforts and objectives. All members&rsquo; strengths work together for the greater good.</li><li> <strong>  Embrace the generational shift. </strong>  Surprisingly, there was vast age range between the hikers in our group &ndash; the youngest was 23 and the oldest was 67. Our backgrounds were all drastically different, our paces were scattered, and we each faced different mental, emotional and physical challenges along the trail. One thing was for certain &ndash; we all had the stamina to keep trekking until we made it to Machu Picchu. Much has been reported on the success of current RIAs as it relates to the aging demographic of current advisors. Boomer advisors who may be looking to retire soon must help millennials transition into the advisory role;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/5-ways-rias-can-attract-and-retain-millennial-female-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a topic my colleagues covered recently on our blog  </a> </u> . Mentorship is key between the generations, and each demographic can learn things from one another. On one hand, millennials will learn the ropes from boomer advisors, soaking up all there is to know about the ins and outs of the business and how to manage relationships. On the other hand, boomers can use millennials to stay in tune to industry changes (social media and compliance issues, preferred method of contacting clients may be more in line with texting over emails, etc). Work together and have the stamina to keep up with the changing times of the industry.</li>",

But whether you go slow and steady or swift and spontaneous, you do need to leave doubt behind and embrace the idea of change-in your beliefs, in your approach, and in your service to your clients.</p><p> To me, this is not just a better way to live, which it is. It's a competitive advantage for the wealth manager who embraces it and does things differently with the clients you serve and the team you manage. I also believe the time for us in this service industry is now. Intimacy is real, personal, and long lasting. Do we want to create a vibrant personal connection with the clients we serve for generations? Why then do we allow other industry professionals less important to the day-to-day significance of our clients seemingly command more personal intimacy and loyalty than we do?</p><p> As a test, I encourage you to name some examples of retail businesses that you are a customer of that you believe understand intimacy and deliver on experience for you. Think of a company or organization that you feel strongly about and for whom you have a sense of loyalty. What comes to mind? How long did it take before you were out of names? My guess is you came up with about six or seven.</p><p> In my asking that question to thousands of wealth advisers, I find it amusing that just six names or so come up very regularly and not one of them is a big bank, brokerage house, insurance agency, law firm, or accounting firm.</p><p> Here's what usually comes up:</p><li> <strong>  Starbucks </strong></li><li> <strong>  Nordstrom </strong></li><li> <strong>  The Ritz Carlton </strong></li><li> <strong>  Southwest Airlines </strong></li><li> <strong>  Apple </strong></li><li> <strong>  Amazon </strong></li><li> <strong>  Zappos </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Over the last several years, I've compared the results of  Business Week's  Annual Customer Service Champs and found they were basically the same names I would hear from audiences of seasoned professional wealth managers. The other interesting thing is there does not seem to be a lot of businesses that really get this service loyalty model anymore. The list is narrow and not so deep.</p><p> With the exception of Charles Schwab, I've not seen many wealth companies on the list. You might say that's because they are too big. OK. But what makes our industry appealing and your practice effective, in part, is the fact that you have the ability to be independent, build your own brand, and construct a client base that buys from YOU. You are your brand. That's liberating and powerful.</p><p> Let's consider Starbucks for a minute. They get this concept of intimacy. They're big, but their raving fans feel like the barista cares deeply about them. Howard Schultz, CEO at Starbucks, has said publically the following, \"Starbucks sells connection; connection to self, to colleague, and to community.\" Did you catch that? Starbucks sells connection, which to me is intimacy. I thought they sold coffee and scones. They seem to move a lot of coffee and scones in their stores. Yet the CEO said they sell intimacy, and oh by the way, if you want to plop down $5 for a coffee, you can do that, too. Wow.</p><p> In the book,  Starbucks Experience  (McGraw Hill Companies, 2007), by business consultant Joseph Michelli, we learn the valuable lessons and the genius of Starbucks' success lies in its ability to create personalized customer experiences, stimulate business growth, generate profits, energize employees and secure customer loyalty-all at the same time.</p><p> Here's my plea. Why should our retail business be any different? Why should we allow Starbucks, for example, to create intimacy, loyalty, and a raving fan base when they do not really provide anything that's noble, lasting, or significant? Yet they do provide value in the life of their customers by offering intimacy and a warm place to sit, sip, and become part of a community. Why can't we get this? As a matter of fact, they can charge a premium for their product because they provide intimacy and the rest. Think about it.</p><p> This example, and others like it, proves to me that this is more than customer service. This is an intentional strategy from Schultz; he himself said it. It's a culture. There are countless stories of their baristas building meaningful relationships with customers. It also tells me that it's more than corporate branding or millions of dollars in national advertising, because this is done at the grassroots level, in community after community. Sound familiar to you? That should be encouraging since your practice is a grassroots practice that does not need national advertising budgets and an expensive branding campaign.</p><p> Finally, it tells me that this concept of creating intimacy and personal connection with your clients is manageable and portable. It takes efforts and intentionality and it can be done in store after store across the country. You just have to do it in your one location!</p>",

    "content": "<p> The fun of the financial advisory business is that everything changes. No matter whether the markets go up or go down, each new day brings with it a set of new challenges and concerns for advisors. Quite often, something doesn&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;easy&rdquo; in the business.Although bringing in an outsider to perform a thorough assessment is a pragmatic solution, many advisors don&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t afford expensive consulting services. Moreover, ofttimes consulting resources have &ldquo;you should do this&rdquo; ideas that do not cater to the specific requirements of a firm or its employees.What should an advisor do then? A self-assessment process can help identify what works and doesn&rsquo;t work for a firm, in addition to honing the &ldquo;right problem&rdquo;. To self assess, advisors should:</p><li>  Have no &ldquo;agenda&rdquo; or preconceived ideas about what might be wrong.</li><li> Be open to talk to everyone, including admin staff, vendors and past employees, who may have firm insights.</li><li> Remember, whatever may be happening isn&rsquo;t necessarily about YOU. Be flexible enough to consider all your options.</li>The following are the steps you can undertake individually or with your partners to ascertain problematic areas:<h3> Interview Stakeholders</h3>Interview everyone who is associated with the firm, including current and former employees, senior management, vendors, clients and prospects. Ask for their feedback on the firm and what they think isn&rsquo;t working. Although time consuming, qualitative interviews provide in-depth, valuable information and should be your means to get feedback.<h3> Perform an Audit</h3>Perform an audit as if you were a client of the firm. Put yourself in their shoes and document each step to onboarding, receiving service etc. This will help you determine if your firm is really meeting client expectations that YOU would have if you were a client.<h3> Review Firm Culture</h3>Closely review your organizational culture. Are your operations and technology meeting their desired objectives? Do meetings run on time? Is your staff upbeat or demotivated? Review all the individual components.<h3> Organizational Structure</h3>Assess the structure of your advisory firm.  Are the right people placed in the right roles? With the growth of an advisor firm, it is pivotal to have expertise in key areas, such as operations and technology, so the investment staff and portfolio managers can focus on investing and making the firm&rsquo;s assets grow.<h3> Daily Activities</h3>Analyze your firm&rsquo;s day-to-day activities. Review how you spend your day and what are you accomplishing. Are you investing your time in the highest return on investment activities? If not then find someone else who can take on your small tasks for you to focus on the highest gain activities. Conduct a time assessment by keeping track of each 5 minutes of your day.After implementing these steps, you will know where your difficulties are and then you will be able to develop an effective implementation plan with accountabilities.

    "content": "<p> Summer is a great time to focus on your marketing and to give you some food for thought, here&rsquo;s a recap of my &lsquo;practical summer marketing tips':</p><h3> It Starts with a PLAN...</h3><p> The old adage &ldquo;Plan your work and work your plan&rdquo; may be clich&eacute; but is often the difference between success and failure to execute your marketing goals. <br/> <br/> Start by defining very specific and measurable goals. Try to set short term and long term goals that are reasonable and achievable. Next, develop a strategy that details the tactics, resources, budget, and schedule.</p><p> As an example, if you&rsquo;re thinking about your website:</p><li> Assign a staff member to become the project lead and get familiar with the features and benefits of the different content management systems (CMS) and hosting services, such as Word Press and Media Temple.</li><li> Determine what internal and external resources are required for design, photography, copy writing, etc.</li><li> Plan for 2-3 month to complete the entire project. <br/>  </li><h3> What&rsquo;s Your Budget?</h3><p> <br/> A question that often comes up is <strong>  -- As a small business, how much should I allocate on a marketing </strong> ? Although opinions vary, I think this fairly straightforward explanation from a SBA.GOV blog post provides some insight:</p><p> [Many businesses allocate a percentage of actual or projected gross revenues &ndash; usually between 2-3 percent for run-rate marketing and up to 3-5 percent for start-up marketing. But the allocation actually depends on several factors: the industry you&rsquo;re in, the size of your business, and its growth stage. For example, during the early brand building years retail businesses spend much more than other businesses on marketing &ndash; up to 20 percent of sales.</p><p> As a general rule, small businesses with revenues less than $5 million should allocate 7-8 percent of their revenues to marketing. This budget should be split between 1) brand development costs (which includes all the channels you use to promote your brand such as your website, blogs, sales collateral, etc.), and 2) the costs of promoting your business (campaigns, advertising, events, etc.)]</p><h3> Take Inventory of what you HAVE and what you NEED&hellip;.</h3><p> <br/> Logo, website, brochure, social media. Is everything consistent, up-to-date, and how you envision them?  Does your brand need a facelift or a complete overhaul? </p><p> Start by making a complete list of everything, yes everything!, that is client facing. Determine what the priorities and goals are for each component. You may not need to change everything all at once. In fact, it&rsquo;s best to make changes in phases. </p><p> The best place to start can sometimes be your logo because it effects many other things. Minor design refinements can produce major changes. The main thing to keep in mind is that you can&rsquo;t do everything at once. Focus on those areas and activities that matter the most and will have bottom line impact. </p><p> When you make the list, remember to include every touch point to your clients and prospects. Your phone answering message and email signature are part of the brand image. The little things can make a big difference.</p><h3> Just Do It&hellip;Better!</h3><p> <br/> Start with what you&rsquo;re most comfortable and see the best potential results.  Content marketing, public relations, speaking events are all great marketing opportunities. They&rsquo;re also repeated activities which presents a great opportunity for continuous process improvement. 3 quick tips to get you going in make sure your efforts get the most return of investment:</p><li> <strong>  Start with a clear and well documented plan </strong> &mdash;that includes a budget, logistics and resource needs, schedule and, most important, what do you want to accomplish from this effort?</li><li> <strong>  View all marketing initiatives as &ldquo;works in progress&rdquo; </strong> &mdash;always be looking to make small adjustments along the way that can push the needle forward to success.</li><li> <strong>  Conduct after-action assessment </strong> &mdash;take the time to what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and what to needs changing. Analyze all aspects of your effort and set qualitative and quantitative goals for the next time around.</li><p> These simple steps can make the difference between failure and success in your marketing efforts.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Mike Esser</p><h3> Majority Want Alternative Retirement Savings Options</h3><p> <br/> Maybe it is this generation&rsquo;s record-breaking student debt, or maybe it&rsquo;s the trend of getting married much later in life, but millennials are known for putting off adult responsibilities. The generation is pushing back the big financial decisions in life like buying a home and establishing a viable retirement plan.</p><p> A new survey <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a> from the Indexed Annuity Leadership Council (IALC) reveals that 37% of millennials say they have no money for retirement, and 24% say they owe more than they&rsquo;ve saved.</p><p> Across all generations, millenials are the least prepared but the most optimistic about the idea of saving for retirement. Most millennials think 401(k) when they think retirement, but with 401(k) plans becoming less fruitful, pensions dwindling and social security become less &ldquo;secure,&rdquo; they are looking to other options. So what is most popular with this generation? CDs, IRAs, annuities, cash under the mattress?  </p><p> The IALC survey shows that 52% of millennials&mdash;more than any other age group&mdash;are interested in annuities. A fixed indexed annuity (FIA) is a savings vehicle that can increase based on the market, but keeps its value even when the market goes down. The goal of an annuity is to retire with steady, secure income.</p><p> Whichever method of saving for the future, most millennials acknowledge that the time to save is now. It could be as simple as $20 a month or a well-spent gradation gift, preparing the nest egg today will ease the transition from debt-burdened millennial to comfortable retiree.</p><p> Since this generation seems to have no idea where to start saving for their future, Jim Poolman, Executive Director of the IALC, shares some simple savings tips:</p><h3> Every penny counts</h3><p> When you&rsquo;re young, you have time on your side, so put as much money aside as you can. This might mean skipping a night or two on the town a month.</p><h3> Take Free Money</h3><p> Consider contributing to your company&rsquo;s 401(k) plan or any employer-sponsored available plan. Think of any plan your employer is willing to match as &ldquo;free money.&rdquo; A 401(k) plan might not be enough for retirement, so consider other strong options such as a fixed indexed annuity.</p><h3> Living Longer</h3><p> Americans are living longer. They need a savings plan that works for them over the long haul, making annuities critical in helping provide the income they want and need.</p><h3> Have an Emergency Fund</h3><p> You never know when you&rsquo;ll decide it&rsquo;s time to leave your job, your employment suddenly ends, or you need some cash for a car or health needs. Make sure you have a few months&rsquo; pay on hand in your bank account to help you through those challenging times.</p><h3> Fulfill your Dreams</h3><p> Think about the life you want in retirement with an advisor &ndash; to lounge in your backyard or travel the world. Based on your goals, develop a retirement plan that will suit your needs.  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image001.jpg\" width=\"331\"/></p><p> Mike Esser works in the communications industry, focusing on Finance and Retirement investments.

    "content": "<p> When I entered the social media game back in 2009, visual content was a minor element to the success of social. It&rsquo;s not that it wasn&rsquo;t important, but it was a side note, an extra &ndash; not a necessity.</p><p> Tweets and status updates mainly consisted of copy and/or small photos to highlight an article.</p><p> But all that has changed.</p><p> Since the advent of Pinterest, social media has been waking up to the fact that visual content is a powerful way to reach users, and marketers are salivating. The past few years we&rsquo;ve seen GIF&rsquo;s come to life, photos become a necessity, and videos autoplay, muchhhh to the annoyance of most.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a much more colorful world out there, and personally, I couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased.</p><p> However, there are still MANY businesses, blogs, and social accounts not taking advantage of the visual content mania, and suffering because of it. They wonder why all their efforts fall short or that they have to work twice as hard to get the same results as other similar accounts. They beat their heads on the wall and spend endless amounts of money, yet just don&rsquo;t get it:</p><p> <strong>  Without visual content, specifically NATIVE visual content &ndash; a business will never become a brand.  </strong></p><p> What is a brand? My simplest definition is a business who&rsquo;s learned how to make its customers and online audience FEEL something for it.</p><p> Gone are the days when anyone can build a successful brand without visual content, without sharing the story of a business in photos or videos, without allowing its audience to see behind the scenes. Without visual content, your social networks will get lost in the massive drain of content because there will be NOTHING to differentiate itself from the rest.</p><p> We are becoming a culture SATURATED with content, saturated with great articles and informative posts. And because I love to write, I&rsquo;m thankful that won&rsquo;t ever go away. But if you want to stand out, then visual content is the way.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s 3 reasons why:</p><h3> 1. Everyone is doing it.</h3><p> And by everyone, I mean &ndash; the successful folks. Visual content is IN, and it&rsquo;s not going anywhere, so if you don&rsquo;t jump on the bandwagon &ndash; it will leave you.</p><p> People like visual content, they look for it, they spend lots of time with it. Why? Well, many reasons. It&rsquo;s more interesting, it&rsquo;s human, it&rsquo;s unique, and we&rsquo;re lazy by nature. Many folks would prefer watching a 2-3 minute video than reading a blog these days. And others are addicted to photos &ndash; if they weren&rsquo;t, Instagram wouldn&rsquo;t be such a hit.</p><p> Think about it. There is nothing special about Instagram other than it makes taking and sharing photos easy. And it was a mega hit way before they released videos. The reason people (like me) are so addicted to it, is simply that it&rsquo;s photos. We love looking at pictures! Especially if they are of other people or places we want to go.</p><p> The more technology advances and the easier it is to make and share pictures, videos and GIFs, the more it will happen.</p><p> Not partaking in this fantastic ritual will leave businesses all sad and alone. And frankly, very boring.</p><h3> 2. Native content is EVERYTHING.</h3><p> Let&rsquo;s be honest, there&rsquo;s NO lack of content online, right? Any time we want to find something out, Google is at our aid. Or any time we want to see a place we&rsquo;ve never been &ndash; there&rsquo;s endless routes to get there online.</p><p> The ONE thing that stands out for businesses now, is  <strong>  native content. </strong> And if you aren&rsquo;t producing a lot of it, then the competition will succeed.</p><p> It&rsquo;s crucial that we schedule out time to be purposeful about creating content for our businesses, no matter how busy or chaotic life is.</p><p> Writing once a week doesn&rsquo;t seem like much, but blogs take time, and I don&rsquo;t always have time. But there&rsquo;s nothing keeping my brand from standing out among the ocean of other social media marketers than MY content. If I don&rsquo;t write blogs, make videos, share photos, and continually produce native content &ndash; then someone else will steal my shine.</p><h3> 3. Humanization is required.</h3><p> Without humanizing a business, there&rsquo;s no way anyone will ever feel enough about it to turn it into a brand.</p><p> Visual content is one of the fastest and easiest ways to humanize ANY business in ANY industry. No matter how dull or dreary your industry may be, with a little photo fun and video savvy &ndash; it can become a brand people love.</p><p> For example, picture a stint. Now take a stint and pair it with a visual story about how one procedure saved a man who had lost his job and was on the road to losing his family home. All of a sudden, we start feeling something for that stint, right? We can relate or we feel compassion.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not like that couldn&rsquo;t happen with a blog, but it hits stronger with photos included or with a short video.</p><p> You can take any techie, geekie software company and turn them into the coolest guys out there if you share the backend story &ndash; the one people don&rsquo;t normally get to see.</p><p> But without humanizing a business, you&rsquo;ll NEVER succeed with social media.</p>",

It is a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre indeed.</p><p> Yet, what does this mean in terms of estate planning, estate administration, and wealth preservation? The decision in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.maxelliottlaw.com/blog/2015/06/26/the-wait-is-over-all-americans-are-free-to-wed/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Obergefell v. Hodges  </a> </u>  created a positive shift of tectonic magnitude for planning in the LGBTQ community because, where states banned or didn&rsquo;t recognize LGBTQ marriages before, moving ahead LGBTQ married couples can now look forward to:</p><h3> Less complex estate planning. <br/>  </h3><li> Complex advanced directives such as Hospital Visitation Authorization forms shouldn&rsquo;t be required for same-sex spouses.</li><li> Married couples may establish  <strong>  joint wills and joint trusts. </strong></li><li> Married couples may use  <strong>  state marital deduction trusts </strong> , e.g., &ldquo;QTIPs,&rdquo; in states that provide such vehicles.</li><li> Married couples may mandate the surviving spouse elect  <strong>  state portability </strong> , if such is available in the couple&rsquo;s state.</li><li> Each party to the marriage may have a  <strong>  presumption of parentage for children born during the marriage. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Less contentious estate administration. <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Fewer probate family feuds </strong>  will ensue because state probate law should recognize the surviving spouse as next of kin.</li><li> Surviving spouses may take advantage of a spousal award provision.</li><li> Surviving spouses may take advantage of a spousal renunciation provision.</li><li> The surviving spouse should be considered  <strong>  guardian of the children. </strong></li><li> Surviving spouses will  <strong>  benefit from state intestacy laws that drive the policies of financial institutions and insurance companies. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Greater wealth preservation and wealth building. <br/>  </h3><li> Married couples may take advantage of  <strong>  filing joint state tax returns  </strong> in states with income taxes.</li><li> Married couples  <strong>  don&rsquo;t have to obtain extra life or medical insurance. </strong></li><li> Married couples may use  <strong>  &ldquo;tenancy by the entirety&rdquo; </strong>  when buying homes in states that allow for such.</li><li> Married couples may decide whose state benefits to use first upon retirement.</li><li> Couples who want to marry  <strong>  don&rsquo;t have to relocate </strong>  to a jurisdiction that is more friendly but also more costly. <br/>  </li><p> The above focuses on estate planning and administration benefits, but there are more than 1100 benefits married LGBTQ couples may begin to enjoy. Couples should thoroughly review all benefits with their trusted advisors before taking actions because every family is unique.  <strong>  However, overall, the U.S. Supreme Court just made the estate and wealth-building world for the LGBTQ community a lot less complex, and less complexity generally means more emotional, legal, and financial stability; and we will all benefit from that. </strong></p>",

    "link": "players-and-planners-which-money-mindset-drives-you",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  There are players and there are planners. </strong></p><p> Players get a rush from the action&mdash;making bets, taking chances, expecting the big score. You find them at the track, in the casinos and playing the stock market. They scan the pink sheets like the daily racing forms. They&rsquo;ve convinced themselves that they are in the &lsquo;know&rsquo;. The life of a player is fueled by adrenaline and stoked by the glitz, the bang, the excitement. It&rsquo;s a big win/big lose way to live.</p><p> If you talk to the player, they&rsquo;ll tell you about their wins in the greatest detail, but study the scuff on their shoe when you ask about losses. Losses are just the cost of the wins. Except for a rare few, the losers far outnumber the winners. And&mdash;unless they have a substantial income to back up their habit&mdash;they are a bad market and a banana peel away from disaster.</p><p> The planners might not know everything, but they know they are not players. The pain of losing outstrips the pleasure of wins and adrenaline is not their drug of choice. The planner sees life through a more measured perspective. Their values aren&rsquo;t centered around the &ldquo;rush&rdquo; but around moving their mission forward.</p><p> The planner might even pony up $5 when the Powerball reaches enormous numbers, more out of social obligation than because they hold any expectation of hitting it. Their focus is on the big picture, rather than the short term score: managing cash flow, saving for retirement, stashing money away for education and making sure their family is protected with proper risk management and an estate plan.</p><p> While the player is turned on by action, the planner finds satisfaction in knowing that she is working methodically towards financial security. When the player hits, they score big and reinforce their belief in their invincibility. The planner could no more tolerate the player&rsquo;s high stakes game than they could fly. It&rsquo;s just in each of their DNA.</p><p> Yet we only admire and respect the player. Take the huge stakes and TV ratings for the World Series of Poker and other big win/big lose events. They stoke the gambler hormones in each of us.</p><p> The problem is that since you only hear about the wins, it appears that there is a magic decoder ring that will bring unimagined riches if you can only get your hands on it. The fact is, there is no secret or magic and the risks for most far outstrip the rewards.</p><p> In the case of the stock market, the proof is readily evident in the most recent Dalbar study that shows&mdash;once again&mdash;that the average investor does not beat or even meet the indexes. In 2014, the average equity mutual fund investor underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin of 8.19% and the average fixed income mutual fund investor underperformed the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index by 4.81%.</p><p> This is not new. The story is the same in the 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30-year analysis. In fact, the consumer average return on equity funds over 30 years is 3.79% vs. the S&amp;P at 11.06%. What does that tell you?</p><p> Investor behavior is a significant reason why these huge disparities exist:</p><p> Investors buy when the markets are at all time highs and sell when markets are tumbling.</p><p> Investors buy the winners and shun the losers, not realizing that today&rsquo;s losers might very well be tomorrow&rsquo;s winners.</p><p> Investors read and listen to the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and believe what the media tells them.</p><p> Consider what winning is all about. If you&rsquo;re a player, it&rsquo;s the big score. But if you are a planner, you  know  the score. You don&rsquo;t follow the herd, you don&rsquo;t give in to irrational fears and you don&rsquo;t get your satisfaction from the adrenaline rush of gambling on your future. The planner&rsquo;s money mindset is about the big picture, the long-term and the values of financial security. So where are you, getting on track or on your way to it?</p>",

Welsh, CFP, is president and founder of <a href=\"http://www.nexus-strategy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Nexus Strategy  </u> </a> , LLC, a Larkspur, Calif., consulting firm to the wealth management industry. Nexus Strategy works with investment advisors on growth strategies and partners with financial services and technology firms to distribute products and services through the advisor channel. He has also worked for Schwab Advisor Services and Merrill Lynch. He was a member of the National Board of Directors of the Financial Planning Association.</p><p> <strong>  What is the outlook now for owners of financial advisory companies who are looking for an exit strategy? </strong></p><p> Very good. There is a lot of interest in the financial advisor industry. Advisors have developed very valuable practices over time. There&rsquo;s still a big demand for profitable firms, not only for other firms looking to acquire but also by aggregators and other financial organizations.</p><p> They are typically small businesses, built over time, with financial advisors as owner/operator. They&rsquo;ve gathered a lot of assets for their clients. Their businesses are desirable, because they offer predictable, fee-based revenue. They&rsquo;re not selling anything; they offer advice and guidance. The whole industry is growing, because it serves baby boomers going into retirement. 10,000 people retire every day. There&rsquo;s a service industry to support those folks: Financial advisors with retirement planning.  </p><p> <strong>  You say that a document management system can save advisors up to 9 percent in profitability. How does this come about? </strong></p><p> There are three components to the research. First, there&rsquo;s space savings. You can grow your business in your existing footprint, but you don&rsquo;t need to increase your space and you can get rid of your filing cabinets. Second, there&rsquo;s compliance. It&rsquo;s a regulated industry. Document management streamlines that and provides tremendous savings.</p><p> Third is back-office efficiencies. You can streamline paperwork and processing and automate processes with workflow. And you can integrate document management into other systems, such as CRM, to create more time savings. When the documents are all on the screen, you don&rsquo;t have to go to the filing cabinet to get them. You can right-click and send them out. It saves a tremendous amount of time.</p><p> <strong>  You   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Laserfiche/3-tech-trends-that-increase-business-value\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    describe a number of techniques   </a>  </u>   that are useful for organizations looking to make themselves more easily transferable. To what degree are these techniques useful for any company? </strong></p><p> In every business that is valued on operating profit or cash flow, the more profitable you are, the more valuable you are. It&rsquo;s universal across all industries. If you want to increase your valuation, your lever is how efficient you are and what technology you are using to drive expansion and profits to the bottom line. There&rsquo;s a strong business case for document management. A lot of companies don&rsquo;t have it. Document management gets higher cash flows, and it&rsquo;s highly valued during mergers and acquisitions when owners do ultimately retire and sell their business.</p><p> When you add those components up, it amounts to about a 9 percent savings in overall revenues. That&rsquo;s pretty compelling. If you have a $1 million business, then you have $90,000 more profitability every year. Businesses are valued on profitability. So if your business is valued at ten times profitability, then you have a business value in your enterprise of almost a million dollars more. There&rsquo;s a hesitation to change and making it all automated, but the benefits are just remarkable. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p><p> This is a time for a lot of these advisor owners who are thinking, maybe in five to 10 years I need to figure this out. If I was going to sell my house, I&rsquo;d paint it and upgrade the kitchen. This is similar, but for business valuation. Hopefully, it makes the decision much easier. You can attach it to having a more efficient, compliant practice, but also to having a more valuable business that owners can enjoy when they retire someday. </p><p> For more examples of how top advisory firms are using cutting-edge technology tools to maximize operational efficiency and improve client services, download your copy of the trend report, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/resource/white-paper-using-technology-to-drive-productivity-and-profitability/?utm_source=iris.localhost.lan&amp;utm_medium=ad-digital&amp;utm_campaign=06-30-15\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Using Technology to Drive Productivity and Profitability.  </a> </u> &rdquo;</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Sponsored by Fidelity Investments </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As baby boomers start to retire en masse, the Millennial generation (also known as Generation Y) may represent an attractive future growth opportunity for many financial advisors. Representing 86 million people between the ages of 18 and 37, Millennials are America&rsquo;s largest generation, larger even than the Baby Boom generation <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1] </a> .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough a recession-weakened economy has made it difficult for some of the younger Millennials to find career-oriented jobs, this generation already controls nearly 10% of U.S. wealth, according to Cogent Research. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [2] </a> Accenture estimates that they and their older siblings will also inherit an estimated $30 trillion from their baby boomer parents during the next three decades. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [3] </a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nCam Marston, the founder of Generational Insights in Mobile, Ala., and author of The Gen-Savvy Financial Advisor, has studied this massive age group closely over the past 15 years. &ldquo;The most important thing for an older financial advisor to remember about Millennials is that they&rsquo;re not like us,&rdquo; says Marston. &ldquo;They have little interest in the dues you&rsquo;ve paid or the legacy you&rsquo;ve built with your other clients. What concerns them most is how you will partner with them to create a plan for their own future.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo communicate effectively and connect emotionally with this generation of young investors, Marston says advisors may want to consider the following suggestions:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Be upfront.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial collapse of 2007-08, in conjunction with the Bernie Madoff scandal, may have fueled Millennials&rsquo; suspicions of the financial services industry, Marston says. To connect with them, you must establish yourself as honest and trustworthy. &ldquo;They will look up your name on Google&reg;, Facebook&reg;, and Twitter&reg; to decide whether they trust you,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Make sure all of your relevant information is available to them. Don&rsquo;t hide anything. They&rsquo;ll look up what you tell them on the Internet to see if it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Act your age.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to affect a young, quirky, or hip manner can backfire with Millennials. They will respect you more, Marston says, if you communicate in a straightforward way and demonstrate that you understand them and can help them achieve their goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Become a trusted resource.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent survey of high-income, tech-savvy investors by Accenture, 44% of 21- to 30-year-olds said they were extremely interested in learning more about investing <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [4] </a> . Therefore, Marston says advisors may want to consider positioning themselves as an unbiased resource who will help clients educate themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may want to let clients know that they can text, email, or call you without obligation anytime they have a question. Your goal is to be seen as a trusted guide who can help them make smart financial decisions, says Marston.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Offer a customized solution.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Millennials are uniquely individualistic within their group of peers, odd as that may sound,&rdquo; Marston says. &ldquo;They want what their friends have and what their friends are doing, but with a unique twist.&rdquo; That could mean customizing a solution in some way, or creating one just for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Self-esteem is everything.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Millennials grew up &ldquo;protected, praised, and programmed,&rdquo; Marston says. Throughout their young lives, some have been hovered over by &ldquo;helicopter parents&rdquo; who constantly reinforced their self-esteem. To build rapport, Marston says you may want to recognize their individuality and accomplishments. Let them know that you notice the individual style they&rsquo;ve expressed in some distinctive and striking way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Use peer &ldquo;pressure.&rdquo;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Marston&rsquo;s research shows that Millennials put great faith in peer-to-peer referrals, so you may want to consider passing along snippets from texts, emails, and positive comments (with permission) from satisfied Millennial clients. If possible, Marston says advisors may want to consider having prospects talk with existing clients who share similar demographics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Target the herd.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Millennials are highly influenced by &ndash; and loyal to &ndash;their circle of friends, Marston says. &ldquo;If you can get in front of a group of them, they&rsquo;ll likely think of you when choosing an advisor,&rdquo; he points out. &ldquo;And if you can identify the chief influencers in the group, winning them over may go a long way toward winning the approval of the others.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Stake your reputation.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Manage your reputation carefully, especially online, Marston says. Millennials will be acutely aware of any experiences their peers have had with you, and they may share their own impressions with friends and acquaintances on social networks and other media. Marston says it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge this reality so you can get out in front of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Don&rsquo;t push it.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Marston cautions that Millennials generally don&rsquo;t respond well to a hard sell. That may be especially true if your sales pitch represents an abrupt departure from the low-key approach you used to engage them and build a relationship. This may feel like &ldquo;bait and switch&rdquo; to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Talk about them, not about yourself.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the essential elements in building a relationship with Millennials, Marston says, is &ldquo;to talk about them and their future, not yourself and your degrees and designations.&rdquo; While this may require changes in the way you deal with some of your existing clients, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like breaking in a new pair of shoes,&rdquo; says Marston. &ldquo;At first it may be uncomfortable, but over time you won&rsquo;t even notice it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For more information, continue to full article <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/292547891;119695294;c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u> here </u> </a> . </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please view the white papers, &ldquo; <a href=\"https://fiws.fidelity.com/app/literature/item/9863829.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u> Exploring Wealth Potential Across the Spectrum of Investors </u> </a> &rdquo;; &ldquo; <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/292549701;119695294;u\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u> Winning Younger Investors: Six Ways to Help Attract High-Potential Gen-X and Gen-Y Clients </u> </a> &rdquo; and &ldquo; <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/292549807;119695294;b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u> 2013 Fidelity&reg; Millionaire Outlook Executive Summary: Gen X/Y Millionaires Not Sitting Idle </u> </a> &rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>[1 </u> ]</a>Barron&rsquo;s, &ldquo;On The Rise,&rdquo; April 29, 2013.<br />\r\n<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>Anne Fallon, &ldquo;Reaching Affluent Investors: A New Approach Needed for Gen Y,&rdquo; Cogent Wealth Reports Thoughts blog 3/18/13.<br />\r\n<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>[3 </u> ]</a>&ldquo;Generation D: An emerging and important investor segment,&rdquo; Accenture, 2013<br />\r\n<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[ <u> 4 </u> ]</a>Ibid.<br />\r\nDISCLOSURESFor Investment Professional use only.

    "link": "the-four-is-of-leadership-inspiration-influence-innovation-and-impact",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> &ldquo;Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It&rsquo;s about impact, influence, and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire team mates and customers.&rdquo;&mdash; Robin S. Sharma</p><h3> Leadership</h3><p> While we may be able to make a list a mile long of factors that play a role in effective leadership, you will be well on your way if you can nail down the four I&rsquo;s of leadership; inspiration, influence, innovation, and impact. These are key factors that will determine your ability to be effective in any other aspect of leadership. Leadership isn&rsquo;t about ideas; it&rsquo;s about making things happen. Focus your attention and energy on the four I&rsquo;s of leadership and watch what happens.</p><h3> Inspiration</h3><p> John Quincy Adams said, &ldquo;If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader.&rdquo; A leader inspires and motivates colleagues. They can spark the passion and creativity that encourages others to accomplish amazing things. Inspiration is the beginning of everything else; seek it at every turn and in every corner. Use your inspiration to pursue something you believe in; use it to make things happen and to inspire greatness in others. Let your inspiration be the spark that lights a wild fire.</p><h3> Influence</h3><p> John Hancock explained, &ldquo;The greatest ability in business is to get along with others and to influence their actions.&rdquo; Influence is how you get things done as a leader. In order to influence others you must build trusting relationships and show genuine concern on an individual level. Be a role model of accountability, perseverance, and courage. Be respectful in all of your interactions. Earnestly motivate your employees to accomplish noteworthy tasks and provide recognition rather than seek it. Become a good listener, then follow through and follow up. Share your wisdom and be transparent in your words and actions. When you become someone who employees look up to, you will have the influence you need to lead.</p><h3> Innovation</h3><p> William Pollard believed, &ldquo;Learning and innovation go hand in hand. The arrogance of success it to think that what you did yesterday will be sufficient for tomorrow.&rdquo; Where will your success come from tomorrow? As a leader, you must focus your resources on challenging the status quo and helping others innovate. Reach across your organization for new and innovative ideas; fresh perspectives inspire fresh thinking. Leverage the disruptive opinions and opposing points of view you find in your organization to generate great ideas and question deeply held beliefs and assumptions. Provide a safe environment where employees can experiment and fail, then learn from that failure. Remember, innovation is never an end; it&rsquo;s only a step in a continual process.</p><h3> Impact</h3><p> Sean Parker tells us, &ldquo;I definitely wanted to earn my freedom. But the primary motivation wasn&rsquo;t making money, but making an impact.&rdquo; Ultimately, leadership is about getting results. Your leadership is not about you, it&rsquo;s about creating a culture of accomplishment. It&rsquo;s about making an impact by interweaving connections, challenges, and creative situations. Recognize that your leadership will have an impact, whether good or bad, on everyone who interacts with your organization. Leadership is about people; awaken in others the belief that they can accomplish extraordinary things and make them feel valued. And then, cultivate leadership in others; leave a legacy of impacting future leaders in such a positive way that they, in turn, will have the same impact on others.</p><h3> Your Turn</h3><p> According to Lao Tzu, &ldquo;A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.&rdquo; As a leader, your value will be determined, in part, by the four I&rsquo;s of leadership. Are you an inspiration? Are you able to really influence others? Do you encourage innovation by dedicating time, support, and resources? And, are you making a positive impact? Four simple I&rsquo;s that, if used correctly, will lift your employees and your leadership.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has called for  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-06-26/tsipras-rejects-ultimatums-says-wont-be-blackmailed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a surprise referendum for July 5  </a> </u> , the exact details to be worked out in an emergency parliamentary session Saturday (today). The Greek people will be asked to vote yea or nay on further austerity (of the sort required in order to remain in the Euro); so yes, this is essentially a referendum on Grexit. (A Greferendum, or maybe a Grief-erendum, as the case may be.)</p><h3> The question is whether Greece can hold together, financially, politically, and otherwise, for a full 8 days. A lot can happen in 8 days. <br/> <br/> A lot will happen.</h3><p> <br/> Greece needs daily Emergency Liquidity Assistance (of around a billion Euros a day) to keep its banks open. This is something ECB has been approving every week, until now; but if ELA is lifted, the banks would likely close. Suddenly. Bank holiday until further notice.</p><p> Tuesday is the deadline for making payments to IMF. Believe it or not, there is a possibility Greece will find the funds needed to make this payment (and one would have to believe Tsipras would not deliberately have called a referendum past the payment date without having a trick or two up his sleeve in this regard), so don't be surprised if June 30 arrives without default (or arrears) taking place. This may be the biggest surprise of the week.</p><p> If June 30 passes and the IMF payment is not made, chaos could ensue. It all depends how ECB reacts. They could suspend ELA, forcing a bank emergency. They could declare Greece to be in default (even if IMF doesn't). Note that IMF has 30 days after June 30 to declare default. IMF distinguishes between arrears and default (just as your bank does, with regard to your home mortgage). <br/> <br/> Tsipras probably has enough tricks up his sleeve to make it to the July 5 referendum without a major accident. Otherwise he would surely have called the referendum weeks ago. He wouldn't be much of a politician if he hadn't planned this move quite thoroughly. (We'll see, of course.)</p><p> Nevertheless, the creditors will no doubt do their best (or worst) now to try to influence the referendum's outcome, using everything from propagandistic news-conference pronouncements to outright-hostile monetary tricks. They will probably think of various ways to throw tacks under the tires of SYRIZA. But such nastiness will only be seen by the Greek people as inappropriate interference, by foreigners, in the process of democracy.</p><p> Meanwhile, it remains to be seen if the Greek people can come to grips, finally, with the fact that remaining in the Euro means accepting truly crushing new austerity measures; measures that will leave Greece no better off than before (indeed, worse off). The Greeks (and people everywhere) need to come to grips, also, if they haven't already, with the fact that almost all of the Greek \"bailout money\" ends up right back in the pockets of the creditors. It's a classic  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payday_loan\" target=\"_blank\">  payday-loan </a> situation. New loans are being used to pay interest on old loans. This is exactly what's no longer sustainable.</p><h3> The Greek people need to decide between two awful alternatives:</h3><p> <br/> Suffer endlessly under the yoke of creditor-imposed austerity (which will only get worse with each new round of payday loans, which will go on forever, until the country collapses), or suffer the one-time pain of leaving the Euro (after which, there is at least the possibility of recovery). Many countries have suspended debt payments and lived to prosper another day. None, so far, has left the Euro. This time, just maybe, Greece will set an important precedent, by rejecting its never-ending vassal-nation status; by leaving the Euro.</p><p> Some observers have pointed out that technically, default doesn't automatically mean a Euro exit. As a practical matter, though, it almost certainly does mean exactly that. It depends whether the Greek government implements a system of IOUs, or rolls out the drachma. IOUs would not trigger Grexit, but under ECB rules, a separate currency would mean ECB can unilaterally force Greece out of the Euro. IOUs would come into play if Greece cannot otherwise meet its pension-payment needs. The drachma is nobody's first choice. It signifies Grexit, a painful series of devaluations, and inflation. (But physical Euros would still play an important role in the cash economy. Greece would become the new Montenegro, in this respect.)</p><p> Whichever way Greece goes, it will provide an important lesson in democracy. The United States only wishes it had a referendum process for deciding important questions. We only wish we had a democratic way of electing presidents by direct popular vote. (Instead, we have the incredibly baroque, outmoded  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_%28United_States%29\" target=\"_blank\">  Electoral College </a> , which is not required to follow the popular vote and could, in theory, be bought off.)</p><p> The cynical way of looking at what Alexis Tsipras has done is to say that in \"typical politician fashion,\" he has passed the buck to others (i.e., to the Greek people) to decide Greece's fate, rather than providing strong leadership himself. But really, isn't this exactly how democracy should work? Shouldn't the people (not politicians; not corporations; not lobbyists nor back-room meddlers) decide their own fate?</p><p> Thank you in advance, Greece, for a marvelous civics lesson. Millions of us, around the world, can't wait to see what happens next.  <br/> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Sam Lewis </u> | <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ember Television  </u> </a></p><p> It's well-known that for content marketing to be effective,  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/blog/2013/10/01/successful-video-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content has to be posted regularly  </a> </u> . A  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/social-media/often-post/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hubspot study  </a> </u>  found that businesses that posted 15 times or more per month saw their web traffic increase by 500%. When faced with statistics like this, content marketing can seem like a beast that constantly needs feeding.</p><p> The problem is that we&rsquo;re now expected to produce more content but with the same budgets. For some organisations, like financial services firms, this can seem like an impossible task.</p><p> Pre-produced content can be the cost-effective solution. Pre-produced content is content that has been created for general use. The subjects and messages are broader and don&rsquo;t tend to promote a specific organisation, product or service. Because pre-produced content is bought at a fixed price, it costs less because the production costs are shared by the customers. It&rsquo;s an off-the-shelf solution as opposed to being designed specifically for one organisation&rsquo;s marketing goals.</p><p> <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/bespoke-content-pre-produced-content-main.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Pre-produced content is like buying a suit off the rail when you can't justify a tailor\" src=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/bespoke-content-pre-produced-content-main.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Think of it as the Marks and Spencer suit to the Savile Row tailored three-piece suit: the quality is still there, but it&rsquo;s designed to be worn by a large number of customers who need a suit and cannot justify having their own tailor.</p><p> For example, Regis Media, the division of Ember Television setup to serve evidence-based financial advisers, has produced a six-part series entitled &ldquo;Six Steps to Successful Investing&rdquo;. It's been well-received by advisers starting their content marketing.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CBXqM8GXNwU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-27-at-1.34.37-PM.png\" width=\"853\"/> </a></p><p> click to watch</p><p> To find out more about pre-produced content, we caught up with Wendy Cook, who runs her own communications consultancy for evidence-based advisers in the United States.</p><p> <strong>  Ember: Why did you start offering pre-produced content as a service? </strong> <br/> Wendy: Each of my adviser clients is delightfully unique, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way! But one of the reasons I work exclusively with evidence-based advisers is because of their shared commitment to focussing everything they do around their clients&rsquo; interests. I added a Content Sharing Library after realising how often I was &ldquo;reinventing the wheel&rdquo; when helping multiple evidence-based advisers communicate their common values. While I still love working on custom projects, it seemed beneficial to also offer advisers the choice of pre-produced content to effectively spread the costs of professionally written content on subjects of general interest to them.</p><p> <strong>  How does it actually work? </strong> <br/> I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it simple, so I can focus on churning out good content. Advisers subscribe as members of the Content-Sharing Library for a flat annual fee. During that year, they can download any or all of the content that is already in the library. That includes new content, which is added at a rate of at least two new pieces every month. At the end of the year, they get an invitation to renew.</p><p> <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/wendy-cook-content-sharing-library.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Wendy Cook's Content Sharing Library, where you can buy pre-produced content\" src=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/wendy-cook-content-sharing-library.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  What about modifying the content? </strong> <br/> My goal is to provide content that &ldquo;works&rdquo; out of the box, but that also can be modified as desired, so I typically provide the content in a fully editable Microsoft Word format. Members can then customise the content, or potentially hire me to help with that. While I retain copyright for the material, members are granted relatively wide license to use the content as they see fit.</p><p> <strong>  How popular is this sort of content with advisory firms? </strong> <br/> So far, so good. My goal is to continue serving evidence-based advisers with quality, pre-produced content, for when it makes good economic sense. It&rsquo;s a specialised service for specialised purposes. In terms of numbers, the service has been up and running for nearly two years and I have around 100 members, with very strong renewal rates.</p><p> <strong>  Are there any particular channels that pre-produced content particularly lends itself to?  </strong> <br/> As I mentioned, there are times when pre-produced content can be the most cost-effective method. The best use is for communicating with specific groups or individuals such as in e-mails, e-newsletters and conversations. Some advisers have also repurposed the content into video scripts.</p><p> For use on websites or blogs (where search engines will penalise sites with duplicated content), I do not recommend using the content exactly as it is. That said, it might be a starting point for a customised version of the subject matter, such as borrowing passages and adding your own spin on it. Or another approach might be to craft a custom introductory statement in your own words and then link to the content in the form of a PDF report or white paper.</p><p> Pre-produced content should not be submitted to the media. For example, if you write a column for your local paper, that paper would expect your column to be your own, copyrighted writing.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  How important is it for an adviser that at least some of their content is bespoke? </strong> <br/> It is very important, especially in your web-based communications. Bottom line, custom content will always be the most effective way to share your unique message, tailored precisely for the specific audience you are seeking to reach. But for those of us who have not yet found that tree where money simply grows and grows, it can make good sense to save your custom content budget for your most vital messages, and take advantage of cost-effective pre-produced content where possible.</p><p> To find out more about Wendy Cook and her marketing content for evidence-based advisers,  <u>  <a href=\"http://wendyjcook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   visit her website  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "I met a large bank&rsquo;s CIO the other day who was told to reduce his IT budget for 2016 by 40%.  He was a bit upset, and asked me if I had any ideas?<h3> I had a few but it&rsquo;s a tough ask, especially when most banks IT budgets are exploding.</h3>According to Celent banks in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific are expected to spend a whopping $196.7 billion on technology in 2015, up from $188.1 billion <u> last year</u>, so how do you spend less in a market that is spending more?<h3> And why would you spend less in a market that is spending more?</h3>Well, there&rsquo;s possibly a good reason for setting every bank CIO this challenge, as most bank investment is in keeping the lights on.  It&rsquo;s keeping the old systems going whilst investing in new systems.  <u> <a href=\"http://www.consultancy.uk/news/1206/mckinsey-banks-must-invest-in-back-office-automation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  McKinsey </a></u> calculate that the average bank is spending 10% of its expense on just operational costs, and this is higher for banks that haven&rsquo;t rationalised their technology.  These costs only get higher for banks that are layering new technologies on top of old. This harks back to my continual call to change old core systems, as many banks&rsquo; investments in digital are just layering legacy upon legacy. The more legacy, the more cost. The more legacy, the less flexibility. The more legacy, the harder to change.It all adds up and soon creates a desperate need to break out of this cycle.  Although that&rsquo;s not easy, it can be done.  Again I&rsquo;ve given many examples of banks that are doing this, but my favourite is Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), mainly because they switched to Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and saved 35% of their operational costs per annum as a result.  For those who haven&rsquo;t heard that story before, the CIO presented to the Executive the idea of moving to Cloud services and had the plan rejected because &ldquo;the regulator would never approve it&rdquo;.At the next Executive Committee meeting the plan was presented again, and the Board rejected it again.  The CEO then asked the CIO why he brought the same plan back to the meeting, when they made it clear that they had to reject it because the regulator would reject it.  At this point, the CIO introduced his friend from the Reserve Bank of Australia, the regulator, who said that not only would they approve the plan, but that it was a great plan.CBA moved all their internal mess of processors to IaaS and are now the most agile and innovative bank in Australia.  In fact, they&rsquo;re one of the most <u> <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/leadership/afr-lists/most-innovative-companies/50-most-innovative-companies-2014-20160303-gn9f40\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  innovative </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://barrons.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/BARRONS_WORLDS_MOST_RESPECTED_COMPANIES_2014.pdf?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\">  respected </a></u> and agile companies in Asia, winning awards here there and everywhere, and provide customers with leading-edge banking products like Kaching!, Tap&amp;Pay, Pi, Albert, Lock Block Limit <a href=\"https://www.commbank.com.au/business/our-innovation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  and more </u> .</a>So if I meet a CIO who wonders how to save cost, I use this as my benchmark example.  Not only can you save cost through cloud, but you can become far more agile in doing so.  It just takes leadership, pragmatic change control management and guts to make it happen.For these reasons, I would urge every CEO to challenge their CIO to cut IT costs by 40%.  After all, it might just be enough of a push to get that core system replaced and become far more agile in the process.",

They went to the IT Department and asked them to build something.  The IT departments recommendation was to &ldquo;knock something up in  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SharePoint\" target=\"_blank\">   Sharepoint  </a> </u> &ldquo;.  The business leader said, &ldquo;No, we need something that the sales people will use.&rdquo;  After multiple iterations between the Sales Leader and IT, the Business Leader got a local start up to come in and pitch ideas.  The start-up got the business.</p><p> The agreement is that the start-up will do the development and then will  sell the software as an off the shelf application.</p><p> It was emphasized, That IT just could not step up and provide what the business wanted.  I&rsquo;m sure your IT department is not like that, but for CIOs, this could be the start of a worrying trend.</p><p> Would be interested in your comments.

    "content": "<p> When I first joined the FBI, I was informed about the FBI&rsquo;s transfer policy&mdash;which meant I could be sent anywhere in the U.S. As an agent, this was just as important as the squad to which I was assigned. So I pulled back from developing relationships and buying a home until I had been assigned to my permanent Field Office.After a couple of years of living in transfer-hell limbo, I learned that every few years the FBI&rsquo;s transfer policy changed!At this point, I decided I needed to live my life like a normal human being. I could not continue living in fear of the change that would be produced when I got transferred.Change frightens us because they are voyages into the unknown. But the unknown is ultimately an invitation to grow our talent so our potential can continue to unfold. To refuse to begin our journey of change can be an act of great self-neglect.Because to change is one of the great dreams of every heart&mdash;to move beyond self-limiting beliefs, boredom, and lack of confidence.If you have mental toughness, you will do anything to break the cycle of behavior that disempowers you. You will need to push your limits and that takes resilience&mdash;moving into your discomfort zone crosses a threshold that awakens a variety of emotions: confusion, fear, excitement, sadness, and dreams.There should always be a healthy tension between the life we have settled for and the potential that still calls us.</p><h3> Why Is Change So Hard?</h3>We opt to continue the old pattern rather than risk the danger of difference.<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Psychology-Executive-Coaching-Application/dp/0415993415\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Research by social psychologists</a> indicate that we are comfortable when our thoughts, feelings, and behavior are consistent, and uncomfortable when they are not&mdash;which produces <u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Festinger\" target=\"_blank\">  cognitive dissonance </a></u>. Change, and moving into our discomfort zone, means admitting that our past behavior was either wrong or that somehow we are now making a break from the past.<h3> And this triggers anxiety.</h3>Our brain is uber alert for change of any kind in our environment. When our limbic brain detects an abnormality, our animal instinct takes over. As a result, our first reaction is to either fight or run away.Resilience is not only the ability to bounce back from obstacles, it is also the ability to bounce through them as we continue to move into the unknown that change often brings with it.When you are mentally tough, you have the ability to interpret your emotions. When you do this, you understand that the anxiety you are feeling is normal&mdash;and even to be expected.<h3> Questions Are The Most Important Tool In Your Mental Toughness Toolbox</h3><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Change_Your_Questions_Change_Your_Life.html?id=n_OkNbE7PUEC\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Psychologist Marilee Adams </u></a> suggests that questions can virtually rewire our emotions, thoughts, and behavior. According to her research, questions that we ask ourselves can open our mind up to learning, connection, satisfaction, and success.Questions are piercing little darts that expose hidden anxiety, and once they elicit an honest answer from us, we are able to name the beast in the room&mdash;that is, the fear we are experiencing.It is, however, essential to honestly name what is going on before you can trigger change in emotion, thought, or behavior.Mental toughness is the ability to look into your mind and call it the way it really is&mdash;with no sugar coating or apologies.Resilience is the ability to take it all in, without losing heart, without judging yourself, and keep marching forward.Just as our soul responds to truth, so does our brain.<h3> 7 Steps To Create A Resilient Mind</h3><strong> STEP ONE: Create A Sense Of Urgency</strong>If you cannot accept an urgent need to change, you never will.<strong> STEP TWO: Put Together A Personal Board of Directors</strong>Think about how you might connect with people who are wiser and more experienced than yourself. Identify two or three (or more) people you admire and respect with whom you can sit down with on a quarterly basis to review your progress. Turn these mentors into your own personal Board of Directors. These are the same people you can turn to when times get tough as well.<strong> STEP THREE: Make A Plan</strong>If you are going to change by moving into your discomfort zone, you need to have a strategy in mind of how you&rsquo;re going to do it. Keep it simple, and review it often to make sure you&rsquo;re still on course.<strong> STEP FOUR: Talk It Up</strong>Self-talk is incredibly powerful because our brain wants those inner dialogues to be consistent with our feelings and behavior. When we ask ourselves questions about why we are experiencing anxiety about the change in front of us, we open the option of finding positive responses to them.<strong> STEP FIVE: Hunt The Good Stuff</strong>Positivity is essential if you want to be resilient in the face of tough times. This does not mean ignoring the negative, but it does mean you will have to hunt the good stuff if you want to remain positive.<strong> STEP SIX: Take Small Steps</strong>Small wins are critical because they make the change real. Most importantly, small steps produce confidence as we smash outdated self-limiting beliefs.They also create the opportunity to build momentum. Again, this is critical because each small step creates more confidence.<strong> STEP SEVEN: Be Diligent</strong>Habits are hard to break because they are found in deeper structures of the brain. This leaves much of our working memory available to deal with everyday surprises and situations. Habits don&rsquo;t need as much of the brain&rsquo;s energy, so changing them takes a lot of attention. Stay aware of a change until it becomes a new habit.<h3> Resilience is the key to producing the confidence, joy, and fulfillment that lies on the other side of the discomfort zone.</h3>How are you resilient when faced with change or when moving into the discomfort zone?",

This advisor made a conscious decision to stop using situational risk profiles and adapt an objective system.</p><p> &ldquo;Many of my clients envision themselves as big risk takers and will check the box for aggressive in the risk profile. There are many other factors that we discuss with the client to determine the type of portfolio we create for them; and many times that portfolio is more conservative. But when their portfolio produces average returns, they become upset and threaten leaving our firm. Then we need to have the risk tolerance conversation all over again and justify why we are in a less aggressive portfolio,&rdquo; says the advisor.</p><p> The advisor made a pro-active decision to use Financial DNA as a condition of doing business with his firm. Yes, it takes a little time and effort to complete, but we don&rsquo;t work with clients who won&rsquo;t do it. Now I can clearly see from a client&rsquo;s report that if their propensity to take chances score is 73% and their risk tolerance is 50%, I will know up front that I will need to manage the emotions of the client during volatile markets. And, I will have a specific strategy that is customized to the client&rsquo;s unique personality.</p><p> Why would an advisor change the way he does business? He knows that 93.6% of the financial planning process is the behavioral management of the client Source: Question of Financial Advisors, Meir Statman, 2000 so he can objectively uncover all the risks associated with a client: financial, investment and personality. And, now he has a documented methodology that supports putting his client&rsquo;s best interests first.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t wait for legislation to tell you how to manage your client&rsquo;s emotions. Become a behaviorally smart advisor and help your client&rsquo;s stay committed to you and their financial plan.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In general, networking to quickly increase sales can often be a frustrating undertaking. Many professionals join their local chamber of commerce or business-networking group, and are initially excited at the prospect (of meeting new prospects). But the unfortunate reality is that these groups often don&rsquo;t live up to expectations; so we quit and look for another way to drive sales to our business. But wait, don&rsquo;t turn in your membership card just yet! There are principles of networking that do work &ndash; they may sound counterintuitive, but just wait until you see results.</p><p> When writing the book, The Connectors, I observed fairly quickly that the most successful businesspeople I interviewed were incredibly skilled at networking, but not in the way that I thought of networking. And the main reason? It appeared that they were not out to make a sale during networking. They had a mindset that fostering and creating a relationship with someone that could become a great advocate for them is good business. Ah, a great lesson learned.</p><p> The focus of networking then should not be on gaining an immediate sale from the people you talk to. In fact, that tactic almost never works. Instead, success tends to come from focusing on building advocate relationships &ndash; those that turn into referral connections, serving as a conduit to other potential clients. The goal of networking should actually be to build a mutually beneficial relationship with someone who is a connector, and one that may never even buy your product or service.</p><h3> So, it&rsquo;s really not about who you meet in your networking activities &ndash; it&rsquo;s about who they know.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s about building a relationship based on trust and credibility and having your advocates do the selling for you. It is absolutely genius!</p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the most effective ways to deal with objections or stalls is simply to ask questions and isolate them. This works because many objections you get when closing are not actually objections at all &ndash; instead they&rsquo;re smokescreens hiding what the real reason or objection is. The reason sales reps have trouble with them is because they believe them and either try to overcome them or simply give up and opt to &ldquo;call back later.&rdquo;</p><h3> What you must do is get to the bottom of what&rsquo;s REALLY holding a prospect back.</h3><p> <br/> Is it because they have a better deal elsewhere? Is it because they know their boss would never let them get a new product or service? Is it because they don&rsquo;t have the budget or because the price is too high? Is it because they aren&rsquo;t the real decision maker, or because they aren&rsquo;t qualified to make the decision on this at all? Is it because their current supplier or agent can always offer them a better price to keep their business? Is it because they don&rsquo;t know enough about how your particular product or service will really benefit them? Or is it because they think the learning curve will be too disruptive to their business? Is it because they don&rsquo;t believe in your value prop? You get the idea&hellip;</p><p> There are many factors that might be standing behind the objection you&rsquo;re getting, and the only way to effectively overcome them is to know what the real or deciding factor is. And you do that by questioning your prospect. Not in an interrogative way, but rather in a consultative way. You do it with layering questions and assumptive questions. You do it by using or adapting the questions below to fit your product or service and your personality.</p><p> From the list below, choose the ones that feel right to you and then adapt them, post them in your cubicle, or record and listen to them until they become second nature:</p><h3> Closing Questions to Isolate the Objection</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;_________, there is something that seems to be bothering you about this &ndash; would you mind sharing with me what it is?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;It sounds like there something else that you&rsquo;d like to share with me about that. What else should I know about this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What would you say is an example of why you need to think about this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;_________, help me get an idea of what you&rsquo;re thinking about here&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Tell me what I need to know so I understand where you&rsquo;re at on this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What other vendors are you looking at for this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What do you think is the biggest reason for not going with this now?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I totally get that you need to (think about it), what one thing about this do you think you&rsquo;ll need to think about most?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;You know __________, it sounds like this is really important to you &ndash; can you tell me why?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How does making a decision on this affect you or your department?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;__________ what else do I need to know to get the full picture on this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;If you went with this and it didn&rsquo;t work out, how would that affect you?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;If you went with this and it did work out, how would that affect you?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;_________, just out of curiosity, how did you get to that?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How much of this decision is up to you?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;And what is your personal perspective on this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Can you tell me a little more about that, please?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How does your upper management fit into this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;If you decided to go with this, is the budget there?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How about you &ndash; what are your feelings on this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;And how much influence do YOU have?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;You know, I keep hearing you say X, but I keep feeling that you mean something else. What might that be?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What aren&rsquo;t you telling me?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How would this fit into your (budget, plans, initiatives,) right now?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I think what you&rsquo;re telling me is __________, is that correct?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean &ldquo;when&rdquo; it works out?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re/they&rsquo;re a go on this, when would you like to see it implemented?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not following you &ndash; can you tell me exactly what you mean?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How urgent for you (your company) is this right now?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;__________, from where you&rsquo;re sitting right now, do you think this is a smart thing to do?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Oh, and why not?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What would you need to see added to this to make it worthwhile for you?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What can I do right now to help you get into this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Level with me, what is really holding you back?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What is really standing in the way of us working together?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Is there anything that I can do about it?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What do you seriously think it is going to take for us to work together?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What else should I know?&rdquo;</p><h3> As you can see, there are many ways to get your prospect talking to you.</h3><p> <br/> There are many ways to get them to open up and reveal what it will take and/or why the deal won&rsquo;t happen. If you&rsquo;re not asking some of these questions, then you&rsquo;re simply letting your prospect put you off, and your pipeline is filling with prospects who likely aren&rsquo;t going to buy from you.</p><p> Take some time right now to adjust four or five of these questions to fit your personality, your product or service, and fit them to the specific objections or stalls that you get. And then use them when that situation comes up. Remember, the best way to prepare for success is to prepare. So start now&hellip;</p>",

    "link": "why-affluent-people-still-care-about-social-security",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The general perception in the marketplace is that for successful people who have accumulated a large amount of savings, social security is an insignificant part of their retirement income. Some people may even surmise that social security is such a minimal component of a wealthier person's retirement income that some may not even bother to file for their eligible benefits.</p><h3> As it turns out, social security represents one of the largest single components of an affluent person's retirement income!</h3><p> <br/> According to a 2014 study by Vanguard, a financial services powerhouse, the two largest components of retirement income for the affluent were social security and good old pensions. Surprisingly, it was not from large portfolios of stocks and bonds or other investments.</p><p> In this Vanguard study of over 2,600 households, the median income of the group (age 60-79) was $69,500 with median financial assets of $395,000. (The value of their home was excluded).  They found that nearly half the aggregate wealth of these households came from the two mothers of guaranteed income programs, social security (28 percent) and traditional defined-benefit pensions (20%).</p><p> The median annual income from these households includes $22,000 from social security, with an additional $20,000 from pensions. Tax-deferred retirement accounts came in third (among those who have them) at $13,000.</p><p> There is no question that these percentages will gradually change in the coming years, especially with the significant decline in the percentage of the population who will have a defined benefit plan as part of their retirement assets. Most corporations have shifted from defined benefit plans to 401(k) plans in an effort to save money. In doing so, however, they have transferred the risk and responsibility for securing retirement income from the corporation to their employees, many of whom are ill equipped to take on this challenge.</p><h3> A large portion of income in retirement for the wealthy comes from another surprising source. Work!</h3><p> <br/> Twenty nine percent of affluent retirees get some income from employment, with a median annual income of $24,600. For households more reliant on retirement accounts for income, the rate of labor force participation was even higher at 40%. It is likely that the trend to work longer and deeper into retirement will continue to increase as life expectancies continue to increase and the cost to finance a potentially longer retirement also increases.</p><p> Clearly, for both the affluent and the not so affluent, social security has become an increasingly important component of retirement income planning. It is likely the largest, if not the only, pension plan that new and certainly future retirees have. It provides guaranteed lifetime income and is also one of the few income sources in retirement that offers a hedge against inflation, given that it provides cost of living adjustments.</p><p> As people strive to meet the financial challenges of retirement, the need to fully understand one's social security options and the many ways one can potentially maximize their eligible benefits becomes even more important, if not critical.  Unfortunately, social security  is an enormously complex program governed by over 2,700 rules. A typical couple could have as many as 567 possible filing options. It's no wonder that over 90% of filers receive less money from social security then they are entitled to.</p><p> Today, social security supports over 60 million people and the numbers are expected to continue to grow as the population ages. What is also clear is that the importance of social security in one's retirement also continues to grow whether you are affluent or otherwise. Leaving money on the table should not be an option. Since social security agents are prohibited from offering advice it makes good sense to seek out a specialist in social security planning to help ensure that you receive all the benefits you are entitled to.</p>",

    "content": "<p> For entrepreneurs and middle market business owners, the sale of your business is likely the only time you will ever go through the M&amp;A process. To ensure success, enlisting the help of a trusted expert is a crucial step in securing the best deal possible.</p><p> Once you have  <u>  selected an intermediary </u> , they will undoubtedly ask you to sign a contract governing your relationship with them. While there are many forms of these contracts, all will address a number of common issues.</p><h3> Duration/Exclusivity of Relationship</h3><p> 12-month exclusive arrangements are fairly common. Most of an intermediary&rsquo;s compensation will be earned through a successful transaction, so the intermediary will want a significant chance to ensure that they reach success. If you want a shorter or non-exclusive engagement don&rsquo;t be surprised if you are asked to pay a retainer fee.</p><h3> Fee Structure</h3><p> As described above, intermediary fees are usually some combination of retainers and success fees depending on the firm&rsquo;s business model and risk/reward tolerance. Larger reliance on success fees usually means that the intermediary is more aligned with your goals, as they will be successful when you are successful. Larger retainers potentially skew this alignment of interests.</p><h3> Tail Period</h3><p> While limited in duration, intermediary contracts typically contain a tail period that covers transactions with buyers introduced during the term of the agreement but occurring after the expiration of the contract. These are very typical and appropriate, but be careful to understand what they cover.</p><p> Overall, because the intermediary is selling their time and won&rsquo;t be paid the majority of their expected compensation unless the transaction is complete, the most sensitive issues to the intermediary will be the balancing of risk and reward.</p>",

Instead of fixing problems and resolving issues, advisors and vendors are quick to point fingers at each other. Stubbornness takes over because advisory firms don&rsquo;t want to pay for something that doesn&rsquo;t work and vendors don&rsquo;t want to relinquish the revenues.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s get to the heart of the problem.

Here are some of the issues, why both parties are responsible, and a few tips to minimize the problems.</p><h3> Insufficient business requirements</h3><p> <br/> Advisors don&rsquo;t spend enough time upfront on their business requirements. Many business requirements omit key information needed for a successful conversion. Examples include stories behind the data, dictating only some of the firm&rsquo;s needs or miscommunicating the needs, and not including all clients&rsquo; needs in the requirements process.  An insufficient business requirements, or needs assessment, will result in incorrect assumptions by the vendor.</p><h3> Incomplete project timelines</h3><p> <br/> The project timeline provided by the vendor is the vendor&rsquo;s timeline to convert the data to the new technology. The timeline may not fully address what will be done during each phase, how much of your time is necessary, whether vacation time has been incorporated, or may not factor in enough time for testing and resolving issues. There may be a date for delivery of data, but not tasks or time for acceptance of the data.</p><p> Your timeline needs to include tasks necessary to fully understand the new technology, implement new work-flow processes, develop new client reports, and change your client services procedures. </p><h3> Unrealistic expectations (advisors) vs. promises (vendors)</h3><p> <br/> The biggest complaint from advisors is that vendors made promises they couldn&rsquo;t keep. Examples are features that aren&rsquo;t currently available but will be included in the next release (and are not in the next release), integration that really isn&rsquo;t, and claims that the software can handle any situation and then it becomes clear the software is not able to handle certain situations.</p><p> Vendors claim that advisors don&rsquo;t ask enough questions which lead to assumptions about what the technology can do. Advisors become angry when those assumptions aren&rsquo;t true and blame vendors for the problem.</p><h3> Inadequate resources and testing processes</h3><p> <br/> The vendor&rsquo;s conversion team is pressured to get the project done and move on to the next project. When the process is delayed, a common approach is to deliver the application without properly testing it, leaving your firm to perform those tasks.</p><p> Your designated staff that assists with the conversion is also very busy. That person could be relying on the vendor to test the data properly.</p><h3> Tips to minimize headaches and increases in conversion costs</h3><li> The actual implementation and conversion is the third phase of the conversion process. The first phase is the business requirements, or needs assessment. The second phase is evaluation and selection. A proper assessment will result in a thorough evaluation and a high probability of making the right selection. This will reduce the number of surprises that occur during the conversion.</li><li> Glitches and bumps along the way don&rsquo;t render the conversion a failure.Mismanagement of the glitches and bumps do. Good project management skills and management oversight from both parties will enable a successful conversion. Be careful with quick solutions that may impact your conversion down the road. Work through the problem at hand and make sure other areas are not affected by the solution.</li><li>  You are ultimately responsible for the conversion. At the end of the day, 1) it&rsquo;s your data, not the vendor&rsquo;s and 2) your clients will be looking to you for answers, not the vendor.</li>",

    "content": "<p> Well..it has happened.</p><h3> Life Insurance sales commission in Australia is regulated to lower levels, albeit with a phase in period.</h3><p> <br/> (See:  <u>  <a href=\"http://riskinfo.com.au/news/2015/06/25/new-life-insurance-framework-announced/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=riskinfo+email+538+150625+Breaking+News&amp;utm_content=riskinfo+email+538+150625+Breaking+News+CID_0b96069ac5e20a1f1442b25d2aee760a&amp;utm_source=Email%20Tracking&amp;utm_term=New%20Life%20Insurance%20Framework%20Announced\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Life Insurance Commission Reform is Happening In Australia  </a> </u> )</p><p> The arguments have at times been ferocious, and those arguments are being watched closely in other jurisdictions such as New Zealand.  Here one of the key policy making departments involved in the sector has put its views into the debate.</p><p> The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has spelled out its concern, saying:</p><p> &ldquo;A number of financial advisers are either partly or wholly paid by commissions that are paid by product providers. These commissions can create a conflict of interest for the adviser; incentivising them to advise that their client buys a particular product.</p><p> &ldquo;Though some types of adviser must inform their clients of any commissions, there are concerns about the ability of consumers to interpret this information.&rdquo;</p><p> Therein lies the actual problems:</p><p> 1.  only some types of advisers have to be utterly transparent, creating distortions in the market place and confusion for consumers</p><p> 2.  trying to create different rules for subsets of the advice industry blurs the distinction between product representatives (pure sales) and advice-based professionals who may or may not include product recommendations as a consequence of their advice process</p><p> 3.  there is a conflict of interest argument which must be considered and addressed, without prohibiting product representatives from providing simple product solutions without comprehensive advice. Frankly, there are many times and situations for clients where they just want and need a product solution, not a comprehensive planning process.</p><p> 3. consumers are largely ignorant about the quantum and impact of commissions in this area, so rarely consider the conflicted advice issue themselves without having it overtly drawn to their attention</p><p> If we are to be totally honest as an industry we would also have to accept that very high initial commissions on insurance sales contribute to the practice of &ldquo;churning&rdquo;, or twisting perfectly adequate policies from one insurer to another for no significant change in client benefits.  Commission certainly adversely influences the behaviour of some individuals.  That is an issue for all practitioners as it undermines confidence in the sector.</p><p> MBIE&rsquo;s issue paper recognises that commissions may &ldquo;create a perception that advisers are less trustworthy and do not have consumers&rsquo; best interests at heart. This can have the flow-on effect of damaging public confidence in financial advisers.&rdquo;  They have also noted that &ldquo;Internationally, a number of jurisdictions changed regulatory requirements following the global financial crisis to either ban or restrict the use of commissions.&rdquo;</p><h3> That is true.  And we&rsquo;ve just seen it happen in Australia.</h3><p> <br/> I remain unconvinced &ndash; though am open-minded about the issue &ndash; that banning commission is a good thing.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/talk_to_the_hand.jpg?w=610&amp;h=406\"/></p><p> In my reasonably long experience of dealing with insurance and consumers I have no doubt that it remains a grudge purchase in the main.  It is nearly always bought with some reluctance on the part of the consumer, no matter how logical the need.</p><p> Frankly, every consumer hopes they are wasting their money every time they buy insurance.  They don&rsquo;t want to die, have their house burn down, crash their car, end up in hospital, or anything else.  They are hoping they are wasting their money.</p><p> That attitude of reluctant purchaser when combined with the rather laborious process of actually getting many personal insurances put into place means that if the cost of the task were to be passed on directly to the consumer to pay in the form of an invoice for time or expertise, it would present an additional barrier to participation in the use of insurance products.  In plain english: less consumers will pay for insurance if they have to pay a direct fee over and above their insurance premium too.</p><p> Having said all that, I suspect that in attempting to balance up the needs of all stakeholders there is some serious merit in the Australian reform concept.  I cannot see the benefit of capping the amount of commission regardless of the work involved on the part of the adviser &ndash; that to me looks plainly ridiculous.  The suggestion that no job was worth more than $1,200 was ludicrous market intervention.</p><p> However, restricting the maximum rates payable upfront in percentage terms has merit. As does providing a phase in period to switch the industry models to something closer to the relatively successful general insurance structure of reasonable and constant annual service commission levels &ndash; that is a good move.  It does concede effectively that commission does have a place as a consumer choice in remunerating a service provider.  And so it should.</p><p> Commission as a method of remuneration is not in itself the villain.  Distortions occur when the amounts which can be earned for simple transactions are ridiculous.  And aberrant behaviour is encouraged when there is no distinction between going through the process of providing a detailed solution or simply switching an incumbent contract to a different insurer on a relatively fast-tracked basis.</p><p> The real villain is</p><h3> &ldquo;Dealing With Conflicts of Interest\"</h3><p> <br/> In a small country such as this, where we literally have only about 2 degrees of separation, conflicted advice is almost inevitable.  Certainly we try to avoid it wherever possible, but it simply isn&rsquo;t always possible.  People on the advice side of the business are married to people on the manufacturing side of the business&hellip;.nepotism in business is a fact of life here&hellip;.people from all segments of the industry are friends with each other&hellip;.it is a part of the Kiwi-way.</p><p> In government and governance New Zealand adopts a principles-based approach to the identification and management of conflicts of interest. There are no prescriptive definitions and there are few explicit rules detailing how conflicts of interest (or potential conflicts) are to be managed by those in charge of running the country. The Public Service Code of Conduct, for example, sets out the general principles and provides the framework within which individual public servants are able to make informed judgements when faced with competing interests and conflicting values.</p><p> (Ref: State Services Commission &ldquo;Managing Conflicts Of Interest &ndash; Resource Kit&rdquo; http://www.ssc.govt.nz/node/7732 )</p><p> This principles based approach to the sector understanding and managing its own behaviour and meeting its own ethical obligations is the standard that New Zealand government and public servants apply to themselves.  When it comes to managing the day-to-day conflicts that must arise in a small country, their suggested approach is:</p><h3> &ldquo;Avoidance and disclosure&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> The Public Service Code of Conduct requires all public servants to observe the principles of fairness, integrity and impartiality in all official dealings. Public servants are required to disclose any conflict of interest, or potential conflict, before they commence employment and during employment if such a conflict arises. It will then be up to their employer (the chief executive of the organisation) to determine whether a conflict of interest exists and, if so, what course of action is to be taken to resolve it.&rdquo;</p><p> Those same folk provided essentially the same legislative structure to the financial advice sector.   The financial services sector employers &ndash; being the consumers themselves &ndash; are given precisely the same opportunity to decide whether to accept the conflicted advice or not.  </p><p> The problem is not the principles, or the forms of remuneration which consumers may choose from.  The problem is not &ldquo;commission&rdquo;.</p><h3> The problem is lack of consistent application of the core principles.</h3><p> <br/> A principles based approach is the most pragmatic and flexible way to address industry reform and the evolution of a profession, but it only works when the same principles are applied universally to the industry. If they only apply to parts of the sector then they are not really principles of any worth.  If you allow the principles to be voluntarily applied by participants, then they are almost entirely worthless.</p><p> When these principles are applied across the entire sector, then they begin to provide some transparency and begin to address some of the issues.  But a degree of prescription helps in the application of the principles too&hellip;such as putting the hidden commissions called &ldquo;soft dollars&rdquo; into the spotlight of consumer scrutiny.  There is undoubtedly work to be done on the subject of how we handle the conflicts that commission as a form of remuneration presents, and there is also no doubt in my mind that in saying so I will have just lost a proportion of whatever popularity I may have had in some quarters.</p><p> We DO need to address the transparency and trust issues surrounding the remuneration models though, and we need to strengthen the methods of dealing with conflicts of interest.</p><p> That path stops a long way short of banning a remuneration model entirely, particularly when it seems to be the preferred remuneration model of the consumers themselves when purchasing some types of products.  We need to be pragmatic in finding the right solutions so that they work for all industry participants including the consumers.  It is about finding the common ground.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I recently had a conversation with someone about how investors who are looking for companies to acquire, primarily look for &ldquo;the next coolest thing,&rdquo; something that looks like it will turn a quick ROI. There are lots of articles out there on how to build a company that will attract buyers, but I&rsquo;m of the firm belief that acquisition shouldn&rsquo;t be your major goal when starting a company. It should be producing the best product or service possible&mdash;something you deliver with passion and integrity.</p><p> Is being acquired a bad thing? Of course not. In today&rsquo;s market, it might even seem that acquisition should be a top goal. <strong>  Who wouldn&rsquo;t like to get paid mega-bucks for something they just created </strong> (Instagram anyone)? However, fairytale stories of striking it rich this way usually begin with a passionate start-up&mdash;not one whose main focus is selling off.</p><p> Why? Because if you start out with the idea that you&rsquo;re building it to sell, it colors everything you do and every decision you make. In my experience if your heart isn&rsquo;t in it and you&rsquo;re just out to make a quick buck, three things can happen pretty quickly that get you off on the wrong track:</p><li> Your team senses it (and acts accordingly)</li><li> Your customers get a less-than-exemplary experience (and don&rsquo;t come back)</li><li> You build an awesome experience that never has a chance of being profitable, and will die a quick death as soon as financing dries up. <br/>  </li><p> That&rsquo;s not the way to build something of real value. Customers flock to companies that have solid processes that are sustainable long-term, and offer something that&rsquo;s value driven and has them coming back again and again. Those are also the kinds of companies that bring top dollar from investors. Building that kind of organization requires a focus on creating success with a team of &ldquo;A&rdquo; players that are all on the same page and dedicated to service. Not the typical qualities of a start-up created for a quick sale.</p><p> An article in  <u>  <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/09/3-reasons-you-shouldnt-start-a-company-with-the-goal-of-being-acquired/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Venture Beat  </a> </u>  last year illustrates my point exactly. Author Jeff Thermond, a Venture Partner at XSeed Capital who has both bought and sold startups, states that buyers know when someone is desperate for acquisition, and it weakens their position considerably. He says, &ldquo;The deals for which we paid a lot of money were always people for whom we had to go looking. They didn&rsquo;t come after us because they were too busy building great businesses.&rdquo;</p><p> Too many entrepreneurs start at the wrong end of the spectrum, thinking they&rsquo;re going to build this cool start-up that will attract a big acquisition payout, and end up failing because they didn&rsquo;t focus on the right thing&mdash;building something that will attract customers and sustain itself long-term. Make your focus to concentrate on the inner-workings and building great relationships that help you deliver value&mdash;not external packaging. And&hellip; make sure you have a road to profitability. Starting there will help you build something that will last whether it&rsquo;s acquired or not.</p><p> <strong>  Stop worrying about what&rsquo;s next and concentrate on delivering what is now! </strong></p> ",

    "content": "<p> As the leading independent lender to financial advisors, we have seen our fair share of IA financing deals. Some go right&mdash;and others go very, very wrong. From surprise last-minute changes to bumps within the seller transition, there really is no guarantee when it comes to selling or buying a book of business.</p><p> Many acquisitions fail: key staffers quit, clients drift away. In fact, according to 2012 research by consulting firm Aite, one in three advisors who acquire a practice as part of building their own book of business found that they retained fewer than 50% of the client relationships they had purchased&mdash;certainly far from the result they&rsquo;d hoped for. The firm you acquire is important, and so is how you go about implementing the deal.</p><p> We have watched hundreds of deals, and we have learned. There are several key variables that will help determine a positive outcome for an acquisition or sale. We have chosen five that we believe are essential to a successful deal. None of them will surprise you. What is surprising, though, is how often these key attributes of a good deal will go ignored.</p><p> <strong>  1) THE CULTURES ARE A GOOD MATCH. </strong> Greg Friedman, CFP&reg;, a registered investment advisor whose firm, Private Ocean, was formed by a merger with another very successful planning practice, has famously observed, &ldquo;a merger is like marriage, just without the sex.&rdquo; So the first question you need to answer positively is, are your businesses compatible? Having harmonious attitudes toward client service, investments, financial planning, office management and demeanor are essential to the success of a long-term relationship&mdash;for you, your staff and your clients.</p><p> A merger or acquisition is a big change, even if you&rsquo;re not moving offices or switching technologies. Your clients will be wary. They chose you for a reason, and they want to make sure that they still are getting what they need to feel well-served and secure. They may have a comfortable relationship with a staffer that they want to preserve. The more complementary the fit between buyer and seller, the more reassured they will be.</p><p> The same is true for staff. Say &ldquo;merger,&rdquo; and workers think &ldquo;layoff.&rdquo; They will be concerned about their future and competitive with their new colleagues. (Of course, you may benefit from that!) What&rsquo;s more, if your staff is a tight-knit group&mdash;as is the case at many small firms&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to worry about how they&rsquo;ll get along with their counterparts. You don&rsquo;t have to make them besties, but the cooperation of both staffs will ease the process of bringing clients along. Similar office styles, from workflows and client service standards to dress codes, will reduce the chance for confusion.</p><p> <strong>  2) FINANCIALS ARE STRONG&mdash;ON BOTH SIDES OF THE DEAL. </strong> We are talking about an acquisition and merging firms, not a rescue! Changing a business costs money&mdash;you&rsquo;ll likely need new branding, new marketing materials and an outreach program to put the newly configured firm in front of both clients and prospects. Both partners should have strong businesses with positive cash flows. This places the combined business on a steadier financial footing, with resources to grow. If you are financing the deal with loans, the new, combined entity will have those payments to make as well. The stronger you are from the get-go, the better the odds of success.</p><p> <strong>  3) THERE&rsquo;S A ROADMAP TO THE NEW FIRM, AND IT ENGAGES BOTH PARTNERS&rsquo; STAFFS. </strong> A documented strategy for merging firms, one that involves the staffs at both firms, should include timelines, benchmarks and accountability. The staffs can teach each other about their respective practices and share information&mdash;the process should help them coalesce into a single team. The partners or buyer can determine the new policies and workflows. Don&rsquo;t leave the transition up to chance.</p><p> <strong>  4) THE SELLER DOESN&rsquo;T WALK AWAY. </strong> If one principal plans to leave the firm, it&rsquo;s essential to create a written transition plan with benchmarks for the seller. A written plan focuses the attention and the payout motivates the spirit. In the plan, include more than client introductions&mdash;the seller should brief the buyer on each client, include the buyer in client meetings and actively talk up the buyer as someone who will provide all the expected high-quality service and more. How long the seller is expected to stick around is flexible&mdash;the buyer may be eager for the seller to take off so he or she can start implementing changes, but balky clients may need the seller to stick around for a while and make a more leisurely transition.</p><p> <strong>  5) YOU NEVER LET THE CLIENTS SEE YOU SWEAT. </strong> Clients of both firms deserve clear communication throughout the transition process. They don&rsquo;t need to know every grisly detail, but should feel like the process is transparent and easy. You may discover that a lot of clients resent the fact that ANY change has to take place. Some may find a transition to be their opportunity to vent about everything they&rsquo;ve ever been dissatisfied about.</p><p> Your mission, as you go through the time and work of a business transition, is to make sure clients never feel as if you&rsquo;re ignoring their needs to concentrate on your own. This is a service business, after all&mdash;and <strong>  clients need to feel well served. </strong></p>",

Our goal is not only to help you create up-to-date subscriber lists that don&rsquo;t bounce, but also to increase the number of click-throughs and maximize the effectiveness of your campaigns.</p><p> A &ldquo;good&rdquo; open / click-through rate for your email marketing campaign is all relative, of course. Below you&rsquo;ll see some of the industry averages,  <a href=\"http://www.smartinsights.com/email-marketing/email-communications-strategy/statistics-sources-for-email-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  according to Smart Insights </a> , so you can compare.</p><p> <img alt=\"email open rates by industry\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/email-open-rates-2.png\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"email open rates\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/email-open-rates.png\"/></p><p>  </p><p> Now that you have some idea of how you&rsquo;re doing, here are eight ways to increase your open rate and engage more prospects with your next email marketing campaign.</p><h3> 1. Consider what type of emails you&rsquo;re sending.</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.pardot.com/blog/the-2015-email-marketing-landscape/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  According to Pardot </a> , the three most common types of email sent by marketers are newsletters (66%), promotional content (54%), and welcome series emails (74%). However, the three most effective types of email include: mobile opt-ins (76%), birthday emails (75%), and transactional emails (74%).</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shopify.com/blog/9834846-4-ecommerce-transaction-emails-you-should-be-optimizing-and-how-to-do-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Shopify  </a> </u>  indicates four types of transactional emails that all marketers should be sending:</p><p> * The shopping cart abandonment email &mdash; which reminds users they still have items in their shopping cart 12-24 hours later and attempts to re-ignite interest in completing the checkout process and lists a few incentives (like free shipping or current availability) to inspire a call-to-action.</p><p> * The order confirmation email &mdash; which reassures customers that they are taken care of, thanks users for their purchases, and delivers an added incentive to shop again, such as a promotional code for a future order or customized suggestions on other products that may interest the buyer.</p><p> * The shipping confirmation email &mdash; which lets buyers know their goods are on the way, supplies additional information for tracking purposes, and includes product suggestions or an easy way of forwarding a link of the item purchased to friends.</p><p> * The customer feedback email &mdash; which asks buyers to take a survey or leave a review and offers some type of incentive to do so, such as entry into a sweepstakes or a coupon code for future orders. Again, this is another method of customer retention, as it makes customers feel as though their opinions are valued.</p><h3> 2. Personalize it.</h3><p> <br/> <u>  Experian </u>  says that personalized promotional emails have 29% higher open rates and 41% higher click-through rates than non-personalized emails.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fulcrumtech.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Lyris-Annual-Email-Optimizer-Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Similarly stated  </a> </u> , email lists that are segmented see 39% higher open rates and 28% lower unsubscribe rates than mass emails sent to all subscribers. To segment your list, ask consumers their reason for visiting your website or subscribing, says  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/6-email-personalization-techniques/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kissmetrics  </a> </u> . For instance, Paper Style asked web users &ldquo;What are you planning for &mdash; your wedding or a friend/relative&rsquo;s wedding?&rdquo; &mdash; and received a 244% increased open rate when the emails were targeted to a particular group. You can also segment based on customer personas, geographic location, past shopping patterns, or customer action. There are a ton of platforms out there that automate the task of personalizing emails, such as Marketo and HubSpot.</p><p> Tip: Get more personalization examples from  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/06/05/high-email-open-rates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Daily Egg  </a> </u> .

Invest in quality content.</h3><p> <br/> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246160\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Entrepreneur Magazine  </a> </u> , &ldquo;Bad content is one of the top reasons people unsubscribe from 25 percent of emails.&rdquo; The people opening your emails are looking for answers to problems, tips or tricks, intriguing information, money-saving deals, relevant promotions and stories they can share with family or friends.

Nail the subject line. <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"email marketing subject lines\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/email-marketing-subject-lines.png\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/subject-line-length-success\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketing Sherpa  </a> </u>  </p><p> Everyone will see your subject line, but not everyone will be compelled to open your email.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/tom-searcy/7-ways-to-ensure-your-emails-get-read.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   INC Magazine  </a> </u>  recommends making your subject line &ldquo;short, catchy, and informative.&rdquo; Keep in mind, you&rsquo;ve only got 50 characters on PC and 25 characters on mobile devices to make your first impression. You can dangle intriguing information, ask a question, or personalize the subject line to make it sound as if it&rsquo;s from a friend. Many companies make the mistake of blowing all their important information in the subject, so users don&rsquo;t feel they even need to open the email to understand what&rsquo;s new. Instead of leading with a piece of company news that may or may not be relevant to readers, include key topics and the &ldquo;what&rsquo;s-in-it-for-me&rdquo; in your headlines,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244556\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   says entrepreneur Carol Roth  </a> </u> .</p><p> Tip: Check out Mequoda&rsquo;s awesome rundown of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mequoda.com/articles/audience-development/best-email-subject-lines/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   best email subject lines  </a> </u>  for more specific ideas.</p><h3> 5. Go back to roots of journalism.</h3><p> <br/> Sensationalism has sold many a newspaper. Be provocative in your email subject lines and opening paragraphs as well. For instance,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/9-simple-ways-to-get-people-to-open-your-email/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   small business speaker Barry Moltz  </a> </u>  wrote a piece titled &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.openforum.com/articles/marissa-mayer-was-right-why-your-employees-need-to-be-in-an-office/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marissa Mayer was Right: Why Employees Need to Be Back at the Office  </a> </u> &rdquo; that saw a high email open rate. Another popular title was &ldquo;My Wife Thinks I&rsquo;m Having An Affair,&rdquo; which turned out to be a piece about spending too much time at the office, working on his small business. Much like tabloid journalism, negative titles tend to get a lot of hits too, such as: &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.openforum.com/articles/5-reasons-stupid-people-make-more-money-than-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 Reasons Why Stupid People Make More Money than You  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> Tip: Review the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2360657/the-best-and-worst-words-to-use-in-subject-lines-new-research\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   best and worst words  </a> </u>  to use in your email subject lines from Clickz.</p><h3> 6. Make it easy to share.</h3><p> <br/> As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/9-ways-to-integrate-email-and-social-media-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Media Examiner  </a> </u>  points out, integrating your email and social media marketing extends the reach of your emails beyond one user to their entire network of associates, helps you identify key influencers, provides another platform for communication, and offers more opportunities for engagement. In addition to including a social share button in all your email messages, you can also share some of your email content on your social media sites, offer incentives for joining your social networking communities, and promote email sign-up on your social sites.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%23Fact%3A+Emails+with+social+sharing+buttons+increased+click-through+rates+by+158%25&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-increase-email-open-rates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   #Fact: Emails with social sharing buttons increased click-through rates by 158%  </u> </a></p><h3> 7. Don&rsquo;t screw it up.</h3><p> <br/> <u>  Over 70% of readers </u>  will delete an email that doesn&rsquo;t display correctly. The  <a href=\"https://www.fanbridge.com/blog/top-seven-most-common-email-mistakes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   reasons for email display errors  </u>    </a> are many, such as: failing to add text to your images, failing to provide alt text for mobile viewers, making the subject line too long, embedding flash or javascript items directly into the body, inserting fancy external style sheets, or using super large and high-quality images that take too long to load.</p><p> Tip: Check out Email Chimp&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://kb.mailchimp.com/campaigns/images-videos-files/troubleshooting-images-in-campaigns\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   image troubleshooting guide  </a> </u>  for starters. If your open rates are good, but your bounce rates are high, you may have a display error preventing engagement. Working with an experienced digital marketing firm can help you fix these mistakes and get on the right track.</p><h3> 8. Optimize for mobile.</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   More than half of all emails  </u> </a>  are opened on mobile devices.  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/9-components-optimized-marketing-emails-ht\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HubSpot  </a> </u>  recommends using mobile-optimized templates to build emails optimized for user experience.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Email Monday  </a> </u>  lists ways that marketers have better optimized their email marketing campaigns for mobile:</p><p> <img alt=\"mobile emails\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mobile-emails.png\"/></p><p>  </p><p> Tip:  <u>  <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/blog/62019-seven-tools-to-optimize-your-email-marketing-for-mobile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Here  </a> </u>  Econsultancy lists seven tools to optimize your emails for mobile devices.</p><h3> Mod Girl Marketing Boosts Email Open &amp; CT Rates For Clients</h3><p> <br/> Mod Girl Marketing is a boutique digital marketing firm that offers full-service or a-la-carte plans that include email marketing if you need it.

    "link": "how-to-effectively-use-a-client-advisory-board",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> American Economic Planning Group is a high-end wealth advisory firm that does sophisticated financial planning. They are proud of how many variables they can track and how often they adjust client plans to account for changes in tax laws, client circumstances, economic factors, and others. So imagine their surprise when they asked on a recent client survey &ldquo;when was your plan last updated?&rdquo; and found that 30% of their clients responded &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p> Surveys are an important component in the cycle of feedback central to running a client driven practice. While valuable, there are a few significant limitations to the instrument. Most responses are numeric ratings or rankings, or multiple-choice among some predetermined responses. Short answer questions frequently have a low response rate and too many of them will cause a respondent to quit the survey. Most important, the questions are short and fixed. Sometimes it is not clear how the client interprets it and sometimes the question is not quite what the client wants to give feedback on. And these limitations contribute to unexpected results. Like, among clients who really like your service, disliking a concept of the service you consider important. Or, answering &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; to a fundamental aspect of a core service.</p><p> So, one of the best ways you can utilize your client advisory board is to dig into some of those surprising answers and get more information from the clients about what they had running through their mind when they answered those particular questions.</p><p> The surveys I usually recommend &ldquo;A&rdquo; clients are part of the client engagement program of ActiFi. Like most surveys, many of their questions seek answers on a five-point scale from very dissatisfied to very satisfied, or strongly disagree to strongly agree. And some of the questions they can be especially valuable in exploring include:</p><li> My advisor adds value above and beyond investment performance</li><li> I have a clear plan in place to meet my goals</li><li> The range of services my advisor provides meets all of my financial needs <br/>  </li><p> The ultimate objective of seeking client feedback and guidance and tailoring your strategy to maximize your value to clients is to reap more referrals. The most useful question on their survey, then, may be &ldquo;have you referred someone to your advisor in the past 12 months?&rdquo; Take the proportion of respondents who answered yes and compare it to the number of inquiries or phone calls you received who reported being referred by someone else (or to calls from clients suggesting you call one of their friends).</p><p> Julia Littlechild, in her ongoing research, finds that somewhere in the neighborhood of 30% of clients report having referred their advisor to someone in the preceding year, and that advisors receive enough inquiries to make it appear as though 2% of their clients have referred. If you look at the answer to that question on your client survey and then compare it to your own records of how many people called, you will probably find a similar relationship. But clients do not know the industry averages. So a great question we have used in many advisory boards that can lead more directly than most to additional referrals is &ldquo;this is what our survey said and this is what we actually observe. Can you help us understand why those two numbers are so far apart? If you have referred someone in the past year, what were the circumstances? What were your expectations when you shared information about us? How did that interaction go?&rdquo;</p><p> This can be a great way to talk about your desire to get more referrals, and to find out what you can do to get clients referring more frequently and effectively without actually coming out and asking them to do it. It can also yield some great ideas on generating more. I have seen advisory boards come up with ideas for cards clients can share with their friends, events advisors can invite clients and their friends to, and other novel strategies to encourage clients to engage in referral behavior.</p><p> If you have done a survey and received some responses you did not expect, what was your response? For many advisors I speak to, they attempt to interpret these results by hypothesizing what the clients meant when they answered the question. And when we have had the opportunity to test those ideas in a live conversation, we have frequently found that what was on the client&rsquo;s mind was different than what the advisor guessed.</p><p> The active exchange of ideas in an advisory board meeting enables you to uncover differences in interpretation of questions between advisor and client. I am looking at one survey where the question &ldquo;I am confident my long-term plan is on track&rdquo; resulted in 38% responding &ldquo;somewhat agree&rdquo; and 11% answering &ldquo;neutral.&rdquo; What does it mean to be on track? An advisor and client may agree that a particular client&rsquo;s saving rate will not get them to their goals but I would be shocked to find that advisor for whom 49% of clients fell into that category. This particular advisor believes that most all of his clients are on track for their goals. So why are 11% of his clients neutral on that statement? And what exactly does &ldquo;somewhat agree&rdquo; mean? What do clients believe is keeping them from being in strong agreement with that statement? What can the advisor do to help clients feel that they are more on track? And how can the action the advisor takes in response to that guidance increase loyalty and referrals?</p><p> Questions can lead to discussions on how to refine your service model. A typical survey item might be &ldquo;my calls and emails are responded to promptly.&rdquo; Assuming that 100% of your clients do not respond &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo; your advisory board can provide you with some detail around what constitutes their idea of timeliness. Does it need to be same-day? Next day? If they left you a voicemail, is an email an acceptable response? Can you email that you are researching the item and will call them back when you have an answer?</p><p> Contrary to popular belief, a strategy of consistently delighting your clients is not the most effective means to increase loyalty or referrals. Consistently meeting expectations and fixing problems quickly and effectively when they arise are stronger drivers of loyalty. Of course, whether you seek to meet or exceed expectations your success will depend on how well you actually understand what those expectations are. A survey can give you a high level indication of how well you currently deliver what your clients expect. Digging into those responses, especially ones that surprised you, is the straightest path to providing your clients the experience they are hoping to find.</p><p> And that firm we mentioned at the beginning - what did they discover about clients who were not sure when their plan was last updated? The answer was surprisingly simple. As it turns out, several of the planners on the staff would discuss the specific adjustments they made to plans or portfolios based on items they were monitoring on behalf of the clients. Others made sure they referred to the plan overall before they communicated those adjustments. So the solution was no more complicated than being explicit at some point in the review meeting by saying &ldquo;now let&rsquo;s review how we have updated your plan.&rdquo; They might pair that with delivery of a one page plan summary.</p><p> Attempting to respond to that surprising result could easily have created a redesign of the review meeting process or adding additional components to the presentation. As it turns out, a conversation with a select group of clients showed them that the solution was as simple as including one particular sentence at some point during the meeting. They saved themselves what could have been a lot of work while taking a concrete step to make sure that when clients talk to their friends they know exactly when their plan was most recently updated.</p>",

    "content": "<p> When Marshall Goldsmith sent me his new book,  <u>  Triggers </u> , I read it cover to cover on my flight to Vegas. Great read. But what makes a good book a great book is when it leads you to action. This one did.</p><h3> The Power of Daily Questions</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s so simple. Goldsmith recommends asking yourself a few &ldquo;easy&rdquo; questions each day. Of course, I say easy because they should be straightforward. But we all know gut-check questions are some of the most difficult in the world.</p><p> He shares:</p><p> For years I&rsquo;ve followed a nightly follow-up routine that I call Daily Questions, in which I have someone call me wherever I am in the world and listen while I answer a specific set of questions that I have written for myself. Every day. For the longest time there were thirteen questions, many focused on my physical well-being, because if you don&rsquo;t have your health . . well, you know the rest. The first question was always &ldquo;How happy was I today?&rdquo; (because that&rsquo;s important to me), followed by questions like:</p><p> How meaningful was my day? <br/> How much do I weigh? <br/> Did I say or do something nice for Lydia?</p><p> And so on. The nightly specter of honestly answering these questions kept me focused on my goal of being a happier and healthier individual. For more than a decade it was the one constant of self-regulated discipline in my otherwise chaotic 180-days-a year-on-the-road life. (I&rsquo;m not boasting that I do this test; I&rsquo;m confessing how much discipline I lack.)</p><p> For those who are stumped on where to start, he draws on research of behaviors that lead to employee engagement and comes up with six key questions.</p><li> Did I do my best to set clear goals today?</li><li> Did I do my best to make progress toward my goals today?</li><li> Did I do my best to find meaning today?</li><li> Did I do my best to be happy today?</li><li> Did I do my best to build positive relationships today?</li><li> Did I do my best to be fully engaged today? <br/>  </li><p> What you&rsquo;ll notice is the recurring theme is &ldquo;do my best.&rdquo; Yes, its subjective. You could cheat. But if no one else is looking&hellip;</p><h3> My Big 5</h3><p> <br/> Picking the questions is easy and hard. I have about 100 things I SHOULD be doing every day, but that&rsquo;s not the point. The point is to focus on what Covey would call the &ldquo;big rocks&rdquo; not the pebbles.</p><p> It also occurred to me that these questions will need to change with the seasons. For me this summer is really heavy into content development. I have a book due to a publisher and an online course that we&rsquo;re neck-deep in curriculum development. I need to be writing and developing content every day. In other seasons, it will be more about delivery and the questions will change.</p><p> Here are mine:</p><li> Did I write something meaningful that will help managers lead more effectively?</li><li> Did I actively work on growing my speaking and consulting business?</li><li> Did I add value to husband&rsquo;s and sons&rsquo; day?</li><li> Did I connect with my father today (This is really important because my mom died recently. He lives close and it&rsquo;s a blessing to have him so integrated in our lives)?</li><li> Did I exercise? <br/>  </li><p> As the clock ticks away, it&rsquo;s surprising how motivating knowing I&rsquo;ll have to answer to myself will be.</p><p> Simple and effective.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Andrew Lisa </u></p><p> Once big, imposing and impersonal, technology no longer inhibits the customer experience, but improves upon it &ndash; but only when technology is used correctly. Through every stage of the buying process, technology has the ability to make the customer experience better, smoother and more efficient. Technology is the driving force from customer research all the way to the actual financial transaction. <br/> <br/> Technology helps customers through every phase of their interaction with businesses.</p><h3> Technology and the Evolution of CRM</h3><p> <br/> As discussed in the article \" <u>  Expert Interview with Ian Michiels on Using Technology to Understand Your Customers </u> ,\" customer relationship management (CRM) has been impacted by technology in every way possible. The example of Gleanster, which researches different companies and pairs businesses with their perfect CRM, shows just how intimate the process has been made by data analysis. The firm analyzes 4,000 software providers and 10,000 companies, and publishes the results of 40-50 surveys online. The end result is technology-driven research that gives businesses a granular understanding of the evolving nature of their buyers and the always-changing dynamics of their customers.</p><h3> Technology at the Point of Sale</h3><p> <br/> The best technology improves the customer experience where it counts the most &ndash; when they are about to make a purchase. Card readers that attach to the 1/8\" jack on a smartphone allow everyone from plumbers to food truck vendors to offer their customers a safe, secure, fast and easy way to make cash-free payments on the go. In restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, casinos and every other entity in the service industry, tablet-based POS systems can be found at the transaction stage. Not only does this streamline the process, but it enables businesses to compile important information that helps them serve their customers better in the future.</p><h3> Technology and the Online Experience</h3><p> <br/> Instead of picking up the phone and pressing 1 for this or 2 for that, customers now flock to social media to vent and seek problem resolution. Social media is also where savvy business owners go to put their ear to the ground and take their customers' pulse. The smartest business owners use their websites not only as their home base for product sales, but to warehouse inventories of authoritative, useful content to inform their customers and help them through the shopping process. Their landing pages flow perfectly with their targeted ads on Google and Facebook, so that there is nothing standing in the way of clicks turning into sales. <br/> <br/> Mobile purchasing gives customers a quick, secure, cash-free buying option.</p><p> Technology is no longer the impersonal behemoth that takes the intimacy out of the buying experience. Quite the opposite, actually. When utilized correctly, technology can analyze data, provide insight into buying habits, provide the customer with tools to inform them about buying decisions and, at the end of the process, help them actually make the purchase with ease and security.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Work-life balance is a great idea, but the pressure of working around the clock makes this concept an illusion for many employees. When it comes to work-life balance, <strong>  much of the focus has been on women and making sure they have the flexibility to be working mothers. </strong> While it&rsquo;s great that leaders are aware of these significant and often conflicting roles, <strong>  it may be time for leaders to realize the importance of work-life balance for all employees. </strong></p><p> In her article &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/11/harvard-overwork-study_n_7553654.html?utm_hp_ref=business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Focusing On Women&rsquo;s Advancement Blinds Companies To Their Real Problem: Overworking Everyone  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; Emily Peck points to research done by Harvard Business School&rsquo;s Gender Initiative team. The study &ldquo;blasts away at two closely held gender stereotypes. One portrays mothers as more invested in family responsibilities than their work roles. Another assumes working fathers are fully committed breadwinners, free from the pull of family life,&rdquo; Peck writes.</p><p> In the end, the study revealed that these stereotypes and assumptions made by managers and supervisors, as well as regular employees, &ldquo;held women back in their careers, prevented men from finding more balance and kept the (firm being studied) from understanding that <strong>  everyone struggles when working long hours&mdash;not just females </strong> .&rdquo;</p><p> One father interviewed in the study said, &ldquo;&rsquo; <strong>  I wouldn&rsquo;t characterize myself as unhappy. It&rsquo;s more overworked, and under-familied&hellip; I&rsquo;d bet that a year from now I&rsquo;m working somewhere else. </strong> &rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> While men are expected to work long hours and to not need family/personal time, women are held to the opposite standard. Peck writes, &ldquo;&hellip;women would explicitly tell others they were leaving to tend to a family need because, in part, they didn&rsquo;t want to be seen as bad mothers.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, this study is making it clear that work-life balance isn&rsquo;t a gender issue&mdash;it&rsquo;s an employee issue. This is where it&rsquo;s important for inclusive leaders to be flexible. In my book &ldquo;Becoming an Inclusive Leader: How to Navigate the 21st Century Global Workforce,&rdquo; I discuss the need for inclusive leaders to be flexible in the way they approach different situations. Without flexibility, it&rsquo;s difficult for an organization to grow and move forward.</p><p> In the example of how we perceive work-life balance, flexibility is a must. Although women have traditionally been seen as primary caregivers, that doesn&rsquo;t mean men want to be working around the clock. Likewise, women don&rsquo;t want to be perceived as bad mothers if they choose work over their child&rsquo;s piano recital.</p><p> The work-life culture at your company shouldn&rsquo;t heavily lean toward a specific gender. Though some overtime may be necessary on occasion, all employees should be allowed to have a life outside of work. Without this balance, work performance will slip, ultimately hurting your bottom line. By being both flexible and inclusive of your employees&rsquo; work-life balance needs, you will have a much happier company culture.</p><p> <strong>  Be flexible with your employees&rsquo; work-life balance. Be inclusive! </strong></p>",

    "link": "6-questions-to-ask-at-the-end-of-any-job-interview",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amy_edwards88\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Amy @BubbleJobs  </u> </a></p><p> We&rsquo;ve all been there; the interview&rsquo;s going well, you&rsquo;ve prepared your answers (after reading the &lsquo; <u>  Interview Advice </u> &lsquo; section on our Blog of course!) and you think you&rsquo;ve clinched it&hellip; but then it all starts to go wrong. It happens right at the end when the tables are turned and the employer asks you if you&rsquo;ve got any questions for them. Caught off guard, you literally don&rsquo;t know what to say and panic and ask the first thing you can think of which happens to be some random question about holiday allowance &ndash; and it&rsquo;s all over.</p><p> Now, despite us blogging about  <u>  this interview question </u>  before, this one still catches people out. Why? Because it can be hard to know exactly what questions you should and shouldn&rsquo;t ask at this point &ndash; after all, you haven&rsquo;t got the job yet!</p><p> To help you out, we&rsquo;ve come up with a list of six questions we feel are OK to ask at the end of any interview, regardless of what role you&rsquo;re being interviewed for.</p><h3> 1. Why Is This Role Now Available?</h3><p> <br/> This is a great question to ask because it shows that you&rsquo;ve got an interest in the structure of the company &ndash; and it also shows that you&rsquo;re keen to find out whose shoes (if anyone&rsquo;s!) you&rsquo;re going to be filling. There are a number of reasons why a role has been created &ndash; it could be that someone has been promoted, someone has quit, someone has shifted departments or someone has gone on maternity/paternity leave or taken a sabbatical &ndash; or it could be that the role is brand new. Either way it&rsquo;s good to know what the reason is because this might affect whether you choose to take the job eg. if the previous candidate quit because they found it too stressful.</p><h3> 2. What Do You Think The Biggest Challenges Are In This Role?</h3><p> <br/> Asking a question like this shows the interviewer that you&rsquo;re serious about the role &ndash; and shows them that you&rsquo;re keen to find out what difficulties you might encounter should you be offered the role. OK, so a couple of challenges might have been mentioned in the job ad &ndash; but it&rsquo;s still worth asking the interviewer for their personal opinion. Being aware of possible challenges at this stage should help you to plan how to overcome them should you be offered the role, which should in turn make your life much easier in the long run.</p><h3> 3. What Are The Business&rsquo; Plans For The Future &amp; How Would This Affect This Role?</h3><p> <br/> This is another question that&rsquo;s definitely worth asking at the end of any job interview. Why? Because it shows that you&rsquo;re keen to learn about the business&rsquo; future which suggests to the employer that you plan on staying at the company for an extended period of time if you were to be offered the role &ndash; something every employer wants to hear from a prospective candidate. Similarly, the fact that you&rsquo;re asking how the business&rsquo; future plans might affect the role shows that you&rsquo;re keen to find out about how your role might change in the future &ndash; and again, suggests that you see a future with their company.</p><h3> 4. What Is Your Company&rsquo;s Policy On Training &amp; Progression?</h3><p> <br/> Finding about any training and progression policies and opportunities is definitely worthwhile at this point for a couple of reasons. Firstly, if the company has limited training and progression opportunities &ndash; and you&rsquo;re looking for one which has lots, you might want to reconsider if this is the right company/role for you. And secondly, if you&rsquo;re asking about progression opportunities, it indicates again to an employer that you&rsquo;d be keen to stick with the company and progress throughout their business.</p><h3> 5. Do You Have Any Doubts About My Suitability For This Role?</h3><p> <br/> This question is a bit of a cheeky one because you&rsquo;re asking for a bit of an insight into how the employer feels about you as a prospective candidate but it&rsquo;s definitely worth asking. Why? Because you might be able to address some of these doubts there and then and make yourself into a much more appealing candidate.</p><h3> 6. Why Did You Choose To Work For This Company?</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re having doubts about whether this particular company is the right option for you regards culture-fit, it&rsquo;s definitely worth asking your interviewer why they chose to work to work for the company because they might help to alleviate some of these doubts &ndash; and they might name some reasons or aspects of the company which you weren&rsquo;t even aware of.</p><h3> 7. When Might I Expect To Hear From You Regarding This Role?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s always worth asking when you might expect to hear back from the employer at the end of the interview for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it shows that you&rsquo;re still keen on the role. And secondly, being given a timeframe on when you might hear should help to put your mind at rest and should stop you from staring at your phone and refreshing your inbox every two seconds from the moment you leave the room until the moment you hear from them.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Content marketing has a lot of fan fare right now and I doubt it will taper any time soon. Interestingly enough, the increased demand in content marketers is met with a lack of supply of professionals that are wholly devoted to content marketing.  Even the savviest PR and online marketers are looking to address needs in this space, but may not know exactly how to create the detailed and comprehensive content strategy needed to address the needs of its clients.</p><p> Whether you are a marketer looking to strengthen your chops in this area or a business owner with a knack for marketing, here is a starting point for what every content strategy needs to include.</p><p> <img alt=\"CONTENT STRATEGY INFOGRAPHIC\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CONTENT-STRATEGY-INFOGRAPHIC.png\"/></p><h3> Brand Story</h3><p> <br/> Every content marketing strategy needs to be centered with a company&rsquo;s overall brand story and value proposition. Keen self-awareness will ensure the content strategy communicates a consistent and authentic brand voice. Content is an opportunity to be very personal with your customers and so you will want to make sure that regardless of who in the organization is creating content or interfacing with consumers via various channels &ndash; there is a likeness in the underlying delivery that remains true to the brand values and story.</p><h3> Why.</h3><p> <br/> Answering the why behind your strategy will offer the necessary direction to craft a well though-out strategy. What are the company&rsquo;s goals? What is the purpose for your content? Why are you creating it and what are your desired outcomes? Every content strategy has to answer this question in its own way. Whether it&rsquo;s increasing influence and credibility, educating your audience, leading them to a purchasing decision, or a nice combination of these and some more &ndash; know what it is you are hoping to accomplish with your content strategy and then settle into the details, because every piece of content will also need to answer this question, too.</p><h3> Who.</h3><p> <br/> Target audiences.  Personas, personas, personas. You can&rsquo;t even begin to think of the specific content you need until you get focused on the audience consuming that content.  Most marketers already have these well prepared in advance since these personas are the cornerstone for an overall marketing strategy.  These personas that segment a company&rsquo;s target audiences into fictional representations of who their customers are, what they are like (behaviors), pains/needs, and how that business meets that need will be invaluable to crafting highly effective and personalized content for customers a business is seeking to attract and nurture. If you need help getting started in this area, no problem!  <u>  Download my eBook about creating personas here </u> .</p><h3> What.</h3><p> <br/> This is the research stage. You can&rsquo;t really know what your customers are looking for if you haven&rsquo;t done your homework first.  This component of your content marketing strategy includes surveying your existing and prospective client base to verify pain points and needs, as well as channels that will be most effective to reach your customers.</p><h3> How.</h3><p> <br/> Once you have this verifiable information based on real data from WHAT, you can confidently move forward to how you will execute / implement your strategy. How are you going to reach your target audiences with the information they are looking for?  Or better yet, how are you going to attract your audience to your content that you know that they are looking for?  Selecting the right channels you will focus on in your content strategy is important and requires that research to make sound decisions. This is the part of your content strategy that you pick your spots to be present and engage with your audience.  Just a bit of advice: Better to master your presence in fewer channels than to take on many channels and perform poorly. And remember, prioritize based on where your customers are.</p><h3> When.</h3><p> <br/> Creating a calendar to schedule for your content is a must.  Once you know to whom you are creating, what they are looking for, how you are going to attract them to your content, and what each piece of content is intended to accomplish &ndash; &ndash; make certain to get it on your calendar.  This is important for a few reasons:</p><li> <strong>  Commitment to consistency </strong>  is what makes a content strategy successful in the long-run. One-hit-wonders may get you a lot of attention in a particular week, but it will soon be forgotten if you aren&rsquo;t consistently putting out new pieces of content to reinforce your knowledge, influence, and presence in a particular space.</li><li> <strong>  Accountability.  </strong>  When you are creating content, it can be difficult to sustain original production.  When you put your content ideas into a calendar, you can strategically plan out your time and type of content so that it never becomes too overwhelming for any one person.  Content strategy naturally includes original content and content curation from other sources.  The calendar keeps you accountable to yourself, motivated by what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish, and organized in your approach.</li><li> <strong>  Opportunity. </strong>  When you are scheduling all of your content, you can easily see the opportunities to take an existing piece of content and re-purpose it into a different format at a different point in time. <br/>  </li><h3> Results.</h3><p> <br/> A content strategy is only as good as what it accomplishes.  Be certain to include what and how you will be tracking your efforts. Goals need to be set, metrics measured to determine effectiveness, and benchmarks to compare what has been done already and also compare it against industry standards.  Certain types of content will have different metrics.  Whole campaigns will have a different set of metrics for collective measuring and then the strategy itself is often measured against the bottom line impact and/or progress towards it.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s to you and being successful in your content marketing efforts.  The devil is in the details, so the more specific you are in each phase of your content strategy, the better.   </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   will  </a> </u>  is simply a document that explains your final wishes. Most last will and testaments leave instructions such as how earthly remains should be handled, what  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   assets  </a> </u>  should go to whom and what will become of the deceased&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estate.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estate  </a> </u> .</p><p> However, while these will requests are common, many  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/testamentary-will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   testators  </a> </u>  leave very specific and sometimes unusual instructions for the living.</p><p> Following are five will requests that are anything but ordinary:</p><p> 1.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/william-shakespeare-9480323\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   William Shakespeare  </a> </u>  &mdash; When the playwright passed away in 1616 he bequeathed in his will something a bit odd to his wife &mdash; his second best mattress/bed. Now, in the 16-1700s, good beds were hard to find (think bedbugs, hay, lice) and leaving a bed or mattress to an heir was commonplace. But leaving your second-best bed? Strange.</p><p> 2.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/janis-joplin-9357941\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Janis Joplin  </a> </u>  &mdash; With her unmistakable blues voice and reputation for heavy drinking and drug use, Janis Joplin was truly a rock star. In fact, a mere two days before her death she updated her will and set aside $2,500 to be exclusively used on a posthumous party for her friends at her favorite bar in San Anselmo, California.</p><p> 3.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/2065818/Designer-of-Pringles-buried-in-crisp-tube.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fredric Baur  </a> </u>  &mdash; Once you pop, you can&rsquo;t stop! Fredric Baur invented the  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles\" target=\"_blank\">   Pringles  </a> </u>  can for  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procter_%26_Gamble\" target=\"_blank\">   Proctor &amp; Gamble  </a> </u>  in 1966 and he was so proud of his creation that he requested his cremated remains be buried inside of one. When Baur passed away in 2008 after a long battle with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is_alzheimers.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease  </a> </u> , his sons honored his wish and filled an original flavor Pringles can with their father&rsquo;s ashes.</p><p> 4.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/robert-louis-stevenson-9494571\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Robert Louis Stevenson  </a> </u>  &mdash; Perhaps one of the most interesting will requests was made by  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Treasure_Island\" target=\"_blank\">   Treasure Island  </a> </u>  author Robert Louis Stevenson. Stevenson had a longtime friend who frequently lamented that her birthday was the same day as Christmas and therefore, she felt cheated out of her birthday. To spare her any more years of grief, Stevenson left his birthday, November 13 to his friend Annie H. Ide.</p><p> 5.  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gruenwald\" target=\"_blank\">   Mark Gruenwald  </a> </u>  &mdash; Unless you&rsquo;re a  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Marvel_Comics\" target=\"_blank\">   Marvel Comics  </a> </u>  fan, you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of Mark Gruenwald. Yet unless you&rsquo;ve been living in a cave, you undoubtedly know of the two superheroes he dedicated his life to &mdash;  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Captain America  </u>    </a> and  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Iron_Man\" target=\"_blank\">   Ironman  </a> </u> . When he passed away in 1996, Gruenwald&rsquo;s will requested that his ashes be mixed with ink and used to print new comics. It is said that Marvel fulfilled his wish.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Last week I attended a &ldquo;LinkedIn for Advisors&rdquo; webinar by a financial advisor who has built quite a name for himself in the industry. I had heard about his presentations, and I&rsquo;d seen other advisors walking out of his sessions at conferences wondering out loud, &ldquo;Can I really build my AUM  that  fast and  that  easily? What have I been doing wrong all these years?&rdquo;</p><p> As I listened to the webinar, I started to feel uneasy when the presenter stated that it didn&rsquo;t matter what an advisor posted on social media. <strong>  &ldquo;The content doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is that you grab someone&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo; </strong> Then he took it a step further, suggesting that the most effective posts focused on the latest attention-grabbing trend.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/27/the-inside-story-of-the-white-dress-blue-dress-drama-that-divided-a-nation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The &ldquo;white dress, blue dress&rdquo; debate  </a> </u>  (remember that one?).  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Caitlyn Jenner  </a> </u> . &ldquo;Post what you&rsquo;d talk about at a party,&rdquo; was his social media advice.</p><p> My first thought: this man and I definitely attend different kinds of parties. And I&rsquo;m thankful. When I engage in a discussion with my friends, our conversations aren&rsquo;t so limited. (And if I find myself in a group where that&rsquo;s the extent of the chatter, I inevitably flee!) I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone it that. Think about it: don&rsquo;t you prefer to talk about things you care about? Things that matter to you and to the people around you? From a social media perspective, I believe that sticking only to what&rsquo;s trending on the internet insults the intelligence and attention span of your readers&mdash;in this case, your clients, prospects, and colleagues. Don&rsquo;t they deserve more?</p><p> The presentation continued, and now the hairs were really standing up on the back of my neck. The message: advisors shouldn&rsquo;t bother sharing anything about financial planning on social media. &ldquo;No one wants to read that stuff&hellip;and they won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Really? If that&rsquo;s the case&mdash;if your readers really don&rsquo;t want to read or talk about financial planning, why are you there in the first place? Who are your followers on LinkedIn? And more importantly, who do you really want to be working with&hellip;someone who is more interested in social gossip, or someone seeking intelligent guidance about their money?</p><p> Of course, as I was heatedly shouting exclamations at my computer (I was more than riled at this point, which gave me a whole new lesson in the value of the webinar&rsquo;s &ldquo;mute mode&rdquo;!) I&rsquo;d answered my own question: It all depends on the advisor. This was fine guidance for those advisors who are simply &ldquo;pimping product.&rdquo; (For years I&rsquo;ve wondered how this guy could spend so much time at conferences talking about social media while managing top AUM. Now I get it.) They throw out a net, hook the target, add to their AUM, and move on. These advisors are not tending to their clients and serving as &ldquo;trusted advisors.&rdquo; The advisors who are focused on serving in their clients&rsquo; best interests are taking a completely different approach&mdash;to social media content and their business.</p><p> I can&rsquo;t fault the presenter. He&rsquo;s a wealthy man with lots (and lots) of followers on social media and an enviable level of assets under management. Plus, I owe him a thank you. More than a few advisors have asked for my help because of his pitch. Who doesn&rsquo;t want to build their business quickly and easily with a few online gimmicks? But once we start talking, I weed out the salesmen, and I have very real conversations with the advisors who get joy and a sense of purpose from working with their clients to solve their money issues and truly manage their wealth. Caitlyn Jenner never enters the conversation.</p><p> When I work with this group of advisors, I find they&rsquo;re a lot like me: They want to share content that matters to their clients, information that helps them succeed, and blogs that have the potential to change the way they think about their finances&mdash;and possibly even their lives. And when the advisors I work with share emails they&rsquo;ve received from their clients thanking them for &ldquo;inspiring me to take the next step&rdquo; or &ldquo;putting my mind at rest,&rdquo; I take pride in what we&rsquo;re accomplishing together.</p>",

    "content": "<p> At a Raptors game a while back, we were struck by the energy of the crowd. It was very different than what we&rsquo;d experienced at hockey and baseball games. Basketball just has a different &ldquo;feel&rdquo; than other sports. It seems younger, hipper and hotter. The NBA is doing something right.</p><h3> Hang out with your core market</h3><p> <br/> The first rule of marketing is to know your audience. But the NBA also knows where to find that audience and how to engage them. The league says its core market is 18- to 34-year olds.</p><p> Where would you find this particular group? On social media, which is also where you&rsquo;ll find the NBA. Various teams&rsquo; Twitter feeds are full of pop culture references to hot hip hop artists and TV shows. You&rsquo;ll find plenty of Vines of dunks, drives and behind-the-scenes silliness.</p><p> The end result is a league &ndash; and star players &ndash; that fans can relate to.</p><p> Your core market may be very different, but you can still find out where they&rsquo;re hanging out and meet them there.</p><h3> Let your fans (i.e., clients) sell your brand</h3><p> <br/> Most professional sports leagues are proprietary when it comes to live footage. Not the NBA. They let their fans share game pictures and video over social media without jumping through any hoops (pun intended). This is a subtle yet effective way to sell a brand.</p><p> Another winning idea: celebrity team ambassadors. The Raptors have Drake, the Nets have Jay Z and the Lakers have Jack Nicholson. These aren&rsquo;t celebrities paid to endorse a team. They&rsquo;re genuine fans &hellip; who happen to have huge followings of their own.</p><p> You might not think your brand has fans, but it has loyal clients who are happy to spread the word about what you do and why they love working with you. Let them.</p><h3> There is no off-season</h3><p> <br/> Letting your clients sell your brand doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t have to do any work. The NBA&rsquo;s marketing people don&rsquo;t get an off-season, because they can&rsquo;t let fans forget about the game for four or five months.</p><p> While your clients are promoting your brand, you will be too. Use a consistent voice, keep your message short and simple, and have a sense of humour. Above all, don&rsquo;t be afraid to take a few risks!</p><p> Sometimes the outcome won&rsquo;t be what you want. But quite often, the payoff for taking smaller, more calculated risks can be big.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A hot topic in the bond markets nowadays is the prospect of America&rsquo;s central bank, the Federal Reserve, raising its policy target sometime later this year (colloquially referred to as &ldquo;raising interest rates&rdquo;).</p><p> Counterintuitively, since the U.S. economy is doing &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; well (to use the Fed&rsquo;s terminology), this may be exactly the wrong action to take.</p><p> The Economist newspaper last week dedicated one of its attention-getting &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; articles to the topic of lessening the sting of the next recession. In the article titled &ldquo;Watch Out,&rdquo; the authors mention that economic recoveries rarely extend longer than a decade, and caution that America&rsquo;s began six years ago.</p><p> The conventional thinking is that policymakers like the Federal Reserve need munitions in store to combat the next economic downturn. Therefore, it makes sense to raise interest rates soon so they can be lowered in the future when necessary. Raising interest rates now obviously increases borrowing costs and intentionally decreases spending activity. The latter is troubling.</p><h3> If America is currently struggling to generate sufficient inflation, why make it even more difficult by increasing costs?</h3><p> <br/> The authors propose the counter: wait until wage growth picks up and inflation hits its two-percent target before taking any action. Temporarily heightened inflation is a much smaller concern than plunging into recession, the thinking goes. Our portfolio positioning reflects a low trajectory for inflation in the coming years, and if the Fed takes action sooner rather than later, we will likely revise our forecast downward. For now, we are looking for signs inflation might shoot up suddenly, forcing a quick response from the Fed. But until we see concrete evidence, we are holding tight. </p>Source: Economist, Federal Reserve, SNWAM Research",

ALIGNS LEADERSHIP </strong> <br/> <br/> Because the results of brand management can be tracked in detail over time, it is possible to thoroughly analyze the effort. This enables senior managers to work together for the optimum total return on investment, throughout the entire company.</p><p> <strong>  5. IDENTIFIES GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES </strong> <br/> <br/> Understanding the components of brand value gives dimension to the upside potential to advance a business, not only through geographical growth but also through product innovation, service development and strategic alliances.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The gripping thing about this case is not just the horrific means used to steal money.  It&rsquo;s the shocking failure of every person involved to ever notice that over a 6 year period, a caretaker isolated, abused and stole millions from a 74 year old, helpless stroke victim.</p><p> Li Ching Lu was convicted of financial abuse via fraud and forgery in Long Beach, this month.  She got 4 years in state prison, which seems appallingly short for what she did.  Over a period between 2002 and 2010, she emptied her victim&rsquo;s bank accounts by writing checks and depositing them in 63 different accounts at 4 different banks.</p><p> Why didn&rsquo;t anyone notice that she began to isolate her victim from her friends, family,  <u>  <a href=\"http://agingparents.com/elder-financial-crisis.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financial advisors  </a> </u> ?  Did any of them care enough to check on their friend or client?  Did the cessation of contact from a person who had amassed a small fortune from investments ever alarm the investment advisors on her team enough to find out why?</p><p> Banks in CA are mandated by state law to report suspicious activity to adult protective services or law enforcement.  Maybe someone could explain how this criminal &ldquo;caregiver&rdquo; managed to launder 4 million dollars through six different banks, using 63 different accounts.  That&rsquo;s at least ten accounts per bank.</p><p> If your bank were monitoring activity on all your accounts, wouldn&rsquo;t you expect that someone just might have noticed the 74 year old&rsquo;s tremendous and unusual withdrawals?  The caregiver bought a Porsche SUV, a home, a BMW,  paid full tuition at her son&rsquo;s private university, supported her gambling habit and made large jewelry purchases.</p><p> This criminal may have been clever enough to get away with it for a time, but six years??</p><p> The law is there to try to protect vulnerable seniors from the $2.6 billion in losses they suffer from financial elder abuse every year.  It&rsquo;s a good law.  But without anyone actually looking for suspicious activity, a criminal has free rein, as Li Ching Lu did in this case.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been a passionate advocate for vulnerable persons for my entire legal career.  I understand how the law works. What I can&rsquo;t understand is why, in this case, it didn&rsquo;t work.   The banks are quick to notice if you miss a payment on something. Can&rsquo;t they develop some systems equally efficient to alert them to suspicious withdrawals and deposits, particularly when there is a change in the normal patterns of activity?  Credit card companies do this. Why not the financial institutions where we bank, sometimes for decades?</p><p> There&rsquo;s a lesson here for more than the banks, all asleep at the wheel until the ripoff was 4 million dollars. Then, they got suspicious and reported it. Gee, great. Too late.  The lesson here is for every one of us with any aging or disabled person we know or love who is in need of help at home.</p><p> It&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://198.57.247.130/~smblogsi/agingparents/the-tough-question-move-in-with-your-aging-parent-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   about the caregivers  </u> </a> .  I have written much on this subject, as I have been a caregiver myself, through agencies and through being privately hired before I was an RN.  I&rsquo;ve taught them, supervised them, worked with them.  Here are four very important takeaway messages:</p><p> 1.  Never,  <strong>  never go cheap with a caregiver </strong> .  You need an agency, so don&rsquo;t hire on your own to save money.  Yes you&rsquo;ll pay more. You will also get supervision, accountability and someone to watch the caregiver.  It&rsquo;s not perfect, but the layer of protection a quality agency offers would have stopped this crime in its tracks.</p><p> 2.   <strong>  Do a background check </strong>  on any caregiver going into your home or your aging parents&rsquo; home.  Even if the agency does one, you do your own too, because you can spend more and get the most thorough check available. It costs about $100.  You get criminal records from every state.  You may not be able to find out about a gambling habit, but bankruptcy is a clue.  It is so worth the money to investigate every caregiver&rsquo;s background.</p><p> 3.   <strong>  Insist on drug testing for any caregiver </strong> .  Addicts, as we know, will do just about anything to support their habits.  Stealing from the elderly is a cakewalk compared with other kinds of theft. Our aging parents are sitting ducks.  Step it up, get involved in who is hired and in seeing that drug testing is done.</p><p> 4.   <strong>  Beware of any caregiver who isolates a vulnerable elder </strong> .  Isolation of the victim is a huge red flag for potential abuse.   Li Ching Lu did this to her stroke victim, who had extended family and friends.  Where were they?  Are you going to accept &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not feeling up to getting together&rdquo; as an excuse more than once? I wouldn&rsquo;t.  Make your way over there and if the caregiver won&rsquo;t let you in, insist or call the police and report your suspicions.  If they give you the brushoff, keep pestering them.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m pushier than most people, but sometimes a bit of pushy behavior can prevent disaster.  Didn&rsquo;t  this poor victim have a single pushy friend to insist on personally seeing her and asking some questions?  In this tragic case, the victim died before the criminal ever went to trial.</p><p> If it takes a village to take care of our elders, we&rsquo;re all a part of that village. And if talking about this with you can help even one, single person from becoming a victim of financial abuse, it will make my day. <br/></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riainabox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RIA in a Box  </u> </a>  </p><p> Financial advisors currently at a wire house, bank, insurance company, or regional broker dealer that are thinking about  going independent  have a number of options. However, it's important that each potential  breakaway broker  take a step back and evaluate if he or she is willing to settle for a scenario that offers less than full independence. In this post, we break down the various options available to financial advisors that are looking to go independent.</p><p> Below are the different independent financial advisor models available to breakaway brokers or other transitioning advisors ranging from full to partial independence:</p><p> <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=35865df9-c29c-4958-89be-a5b0c4325175&amp;placement_guid=21025935-cc53-4c68-b48a-f760d84a2ee5&amp;portal_id=305003&amp;redirect_url=APefjpGIm5CfWZFZneM1qPNoue2PGCR_62i6QMuD2U1_nIkLSTvZ39OytQ4P9rXb5UdkM2QSjT_Q18JdMYULkQbgUHxpPst5m7JZguTIpTh2TSZOveaSy2JUUSK_TFh4YK5ANWYs5diTfISlLMpyXZmZEoEXg6JWzkkczg4eqse8h2NC4UlrUBEpPk3sCYAR9KUUbYPD9PGjKLabs-VC4wcvzDMPxcYd24lMeLQJ0CPE70-Wh5EmfJPQBWuHnNxPQy1_b8adwXSn&amp;hsutk=1a859e8c35c6c8efbb9dc23cdc4de418&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fshould-i-join-an-independent-bd-ria-or-start-my-own-ria-firm&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fshould-i-join-an-independent-bd-ria-or-start-my-own-ria-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Download our Free 10 Step Checklist to Start an RIA Firm  </u>    </a></p><li> <strong>  Start your own registered investment adviser (RIA) firm </strong></li><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://meridian-iq.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meridian-IQ  </a> </u> , 2,159 new RIA firms were created in 2014. This compares to 1,959 new RIA firms formed in 2013 which implies a 10.2% year over year increase in the number of new advisory firms being created. Many in the industry assume that firms need a significant amount of assets under management (AUM) in order to prosper. However, the industry stats paint a much different picture. According to Meridian-IQ, of the 2,159 new firms formed in 2014, only 635 of those shops currently have an AUM figure greater than $50 million. Thus, over 70% of new RIA firms which are created start with less than $50 million in AUM. Furthermore, most advisors do not realize that the median AUM of the 32,000+ RIA firms currently registered is only $19.3 million according to the latest Meridian-IQ statistics.</p><p> At RIA in a Box&reg;, we continue to see an increasing number of small advisory firms thriving as more advisors seek to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/the-inherent-fiduciary-duty-that-an-investment-adviser-must-adhere-to\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   act as a fiduciary  </a> </u>  for their clients. This is largely due to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/ria-democratization-starting-your-own-ria-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   rapid evolution of the ecosystem supporting independent RIA firms  </a> </u> . From the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/ria-registration-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   registration process  </a> </u>  and onward, firms like ours along with a number of custodians, technology vendors, and others allow even the smallest of investment advisory firms to operate with incredible efficiency at an affordable cost. Compliance is a serious consideration for any new RIA firm, but again, firms like ours have experience helping thousands of fellow investment advisers implement comprehensive, yet efficient compliance programs with the benefits of the latest technology. </p><p> Creating his or her own investment advisory firm is not for everyone, but we do encourage every breakaway broker to give it serious consideration before considering other \"quasi independent\" options given the potential emotional and financial benefits of full independence. </p><li> <strong>  Start your own hybrid RIA firm by partnering with an independent broker dealer (IBD) </strong></li><p> Under the RIA model, investment advisers are only allowed to charge fees and may not receive any commissions. Some financial advisors transitioning from larger institutions may still have a significant percentage of their practice operating under a brokerage model. Thus, there are a number of IBD firms which will allow an advisor to operate his or her own RIA firm while simultaneously operating as a registered representative of the IBD firm generally as an independent contractor. </p><p> While a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hybrid-ria-registration\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   hybrid setup  </a> </u>  may allow an advisor to offer both brokerage and advisory services, it should be noted that this arrangement is generally under greater regulatory scrutiny given the potential conflicts of interest and there will be some financial trade-offs to the advisor. As such, we generally recommend that advisors only consider this option if they have a significant brokerage business. All else being equal, we believe that operating 100% under the RIA fiduciary model best aligns both client and advisor incentives and allows for much more simplicity and clarity. However, there may be times when it makes to sense to explore a hybrid setup. </p><p> As part of the RIA registration consultation process, we are happy to make introductions to IBD firms that may be a good fit for your practice. It's also important to note that when registered to an IBD firm, an advisor is still generally responsible for securing office space, hiring and compensating staff, and other general overhead expenses.</p><li> <strong>  Join an IBD as both an investment adviser (IA) and registered representative (RR) </strong></li><p> If an advisor is reluctant to operate his or her own RIA firm, most IBD firms will also allow a financial advisor to be registered to the IBD firm as both an investment adviser and registered representative. This scenario is at times referred to as joining a corporate RIA. In this case, the corporate advisory firm is generally owned and operated by the IBD firm. In other similar scenarios, the financial advisor will join a super office of supervisory jurisdiction (Super OSJ) that may be affiliated with a particular IBD. The corporate RIA and/or Super OSJ firm will provide additional infrastructure and compliance support, however there may be significant financial trade-offs to the financial advisor. And much like the hybrid setup, the financial advisor will still be considered an independent contractor and will be responsible for paying for all general overhead expenses.</p><p> Often, under this arrangement, an advisor will operate under a \"doing business as\" (DBA) name but all investment business is still conducted directly through the corporate RIA and IBD firm. This scenario does usually offer more independence than being affiliated with a traditional wire house. However in our experience, we often see advisors shortly transition to starting their own RIA firm given the financial trade-offs of this model along with the realization that operating their own firm is not as daunting as it may have first seemed and offers more flexibility in regards to investment, custodian,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-to-select-technology-and-software-for-a-new-ria-firm-series-recap\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   technology  </a> </u> , and other vendor decisions.</p><li> <strong>  Join an existing RIA firm </strong></li><p> Financial advisors can also join an RIA firm already in existence and operating exclusively as a fiduciary with no brokerage business. This scenario can range from partnering with another local advisor already in business or by joining a larger, national investment advisory firm or corporate RIA. Each individual arrangement can vary dramatically as far as the autonomy, economic rewards, and overall independence offered. It's important for a financial advisor to remember that in this case he or she will be partnered with or be working for another individual or group of individuals. Thus, it's essential that it is the right cultural fit.</p>",

    "content": "<strong> Conflicts are a natural part of any organization, including financial advisory teams.</strong>No firm is conflict-free, but unresolved conflict can lead to all kinds of obstacles in processes and between employees and the management, or between individual employees.How do financial advisors ensure the flow of communication includes openly resolving difficult issues or interpersonal conflicts? Let&rsquo;s take a look at some basic &ldquo;rules of engagement&rdquo; for trying to create a professional environment where respectful conflict is encouraged:<h3> Agree To Disagree</h3>The leader advisor or partners need to let their employees know that it is &ldquo;okay&rdquo; to disagree. In fact, many a times a disagreement and debate can lead to innovative solutions and positive changes within the organization, as long as it is raised respectfully.<h3> Safe Place</h3>Establish a &ldquo;safe place&rdquo;, such as HR, for your employees if they want to address any issue. Provide them with appropriate internal or external support system if they feel the need to resolve difficult interpersonal conflicts.<h3> Suggestion Boxes</h3>Provide suggestion boxes via e-mail to establish open and clear communication lines with your staff. Hold a monthly forum to submit anonymous questions and have them answered by the designated person. You need to develop an environment where publicly addressing criticism or questions is acceptable.<h3> A &ldquo;No Gossip&rdquo; Environment</h3>Cultivate a healthy work culture where employees should be encouraged to address problems directly with the individual involved. Discourage gossip as it leads to a toxic work environment.<h3> DISC Behavioral Tool</h3>Learn and use the DISC behavioral tool to understand more about differences in communication styles. Everyone has a different working approach. It can be challenging, but important to embrace differences for diversity, creativity and a more balanced team. Accepting people who are different from you will serve you well in all aspects of life.<h3> Refrain From Judging</h3>Refrain from judging your colleagues. You have no clue why someone does what he or she does. Assume &ldquo;positive intent&rdquo; in your interactions with employees and managers. It can be quite liberating to reframe for a positive outcome instead of assuming the work intentions.<h3> &ldquo;I&rdquo; Statements</h3>Use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements instead of &ldquo;You&rdquo; statements. The &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements are less accusatory as compared to &ldquo;You&rdquo; statements. If my behavior tends to offend you, take responsibility for your side of the equation.It is critical for managers to inculcate positive conflict-resolving approaches within their organizations to ensure things turn ugly. Remember, your employees should feel safe to address conflicts in an open and respectable manner at the workplace.

    "content": "<p> Can you enjoy sipping cool lemonade on your back porch *and* grow your career or business this summer? Absolutely! Here are 3 seeds to plant for meaning, purpose, and inspiration at work.</p><p> If someone comes to your house this time of year, are they likely to find you in the garden? We are beginning to enjoy some of the early vegetables from ours. I always anxiously await that first ripe tomato, fresh off the vine. Little compares to that naturally sweet treat! <br/> <br/> While the hot summer sun often encourages a slower pace, don't assume your career or business must lie dormant for the next three months. Last July - the month typically known for vacations - proved the most fruitful of the year for several of my clients! They approached the month with purpose and intention and yielded terrific results - while also having plenty of time to sip lemonade on the back porch.</p><p> Regardless of the seasonal cycles of your line of work, summer is an ideal time to grow your career. Here are three ways to plant the seeds for meaning, purpose, and inspiration:</p><h3> 1. Watch TED Talks. </h3><p> <br/> The best ideas from some of the best minds in less than 20 minutes! I often flip these on while making dinner, folding laundry, or when I arrive early to a meeting. Visit  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.TED.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.TED.com  </a> </u>  and search topics or thought leaders of interest. A few of my favorites:  Why Good Leaders Make You Feel Safe  by Simon Sinek,  The Power of Introverts  by Susan Cain,  The Happy Secret To Better Work  by Shawn Achor, and a recent find,  How To Fix A Broken School  by Linda Cliatt-Wayman.</p><h3>  2. Read books. </h3><p> <br/> Many of my friends and colleagues like nothing better than lounging on a summer day with a powerful, thought-provoking book (or, periodically, a don't-make-me-think one). Although asking me my favorite book will leave me flustered for days ;-), three have truly helped shape me and my business. You can read about them in my recent article for the Des Moines Business Record ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.iowabiz.com/2015/06/3-authors-who-helped-shape-my-business.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   click here  </a> </u> ). </p><h3> 3. Plan your growth. </h3><p> <br/> Just like a well-cared-for garden will likely produce more than one that's left to its own devices, an intentional career will flourish more quickly and seamlessly as well. Start by prioritizing your day and blocking time for that which matters most. If you want help with this (as well as access to the signature planning / tracking tools I have used for years), join us for our upcoming session, Run Your Day (So It Doesn't Run You!).  <u>  <a href=\"http://meaning-and-purpose.com/AchieverBreakthrough.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Click here  </a> </u>  for details and to enroll.</p><p> And I wasn't kidding about that time on the back porch with a frosty lemonade. While the \"lazy, hazy days of summer\" might seem an enigma, you definitely need some downtime to replenish and refresh. Plant your seeds for growth, nurture as needed, and prepare to reap a bountiful harvest!  </p><p> <strong>  To your meaningful career and purposeful life! </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> How you feel about the word &ldquo;sales&rdquo; largely depends on the culture of your organization.  Companies that are driven by sales vision and leadership tend to embrace and reward the sales role.  More operational focused companies, or those that don&rsquo;t traditionally see themselves as sales focused, do not embrace the semantics as well.</p><p> Many recent LinkedIn discussions have focused on the word &ldquo;sales&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Does the word &ldquo;sales&rdquo; have negative connotations?&rdquo; &ldquo;Should you call yourself something other than &ldquo;sales&rdquo;? &ldquo;What is the difference between &ldquo;sales&rdquo; and &ldquo;business development?&rdquo;</p><p> While working with a client to define sales and service outcomes, one of the project team members said, &ldquo;This is exactly what we need.  One thing though, let&rsquo;s not call this sales.  Let&rsquo;s think of a different title, one that is not so intimidating.&rdquo;   We had agreed to the expected outcomes of the program,  which was for representatives to recognize customer needs and position solutions to help them reach their personal and business financial goals.  Sounds like sales to me!</p><p> Titles are not that significant.  What really matters is that you define what &ldquo;sales&rdquo; means to your organization and to your customers.  My advice to the client was simple &ndash; &ldquo;Call it what it is.  Don&rsquo;t deny it &ndash; define it!&rdquo;</p><p> As the sales profession has evolved, so have the methods, beliefs and descriptions thereof.  We define the primary approaches to sales and service as transactional, emotional and consultative.  Most sales-oriented companies have embraced some form of consultative selling.  With that said &ndash; that does not guarantee that everyone in the organization understands what that means to the company or what it means to customers, or that they are skilled in related competencies.  Communicating your company beliefs and expectations regarding sales and customer service is critical.  If your people are uneasy about the word &ldquo;sales&rdquo;,  consider clarification such as:</p><li> You are not going to &ldquo;convince&rdquo; anyone to buy anything if they do not have a need or want, realized or not.</li><li> Great service is foundational to customer relationships and is foundational to the sales process, but it is not selling.  Just providing good service will not gain you more sales.</li><li> Selling is a two way street &ndash; the solutions should be good for you and for your customer.</li><li> Consultative selling is a matter of understanding the customer&rsquo;s core business, their goals and needs and positioning solutions that are valued for each individual stakeholder.</li><li> You should feel good about what you recommend to customers, that taking your recommendation is positive for them. <br/>  </li><h3> Three Ways to Define Sales</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Traditional/Transactional Selling </strong>  &ndash; Those who subscribe to traditional selling tend to take a product-oriented approach to sales.  They respond to customer inquiries with little regard or understanding of the customer&rsquo;s situation or latent needs.  They may seek to understand customer needs, but with the focus on making a sale.  Traditional salespeople tend to stress features and benefits over value for the customer.  Presentations tend to be more of a monologue.</p><p> <strong>  Emotional Selling </strong>  &ndash; This is very seller-centric.  Those who subscribe to emotional selling take the stance that if the customer likes them and they provide good service, that is most important and they will get whatever opportunities are available.   This is a very non-assertive approach to selling, one which is not a good use of time for the customer or the salesperson.</p><p> <strong>  Consultative Selling </strong>  &ndash; Salespeople who use a consultative approach are collaborative and agile, adjusting to the needs of the customer and their specific circumstances.  They are advisors, seeking to understand their customer&rsquo;s core business, their goals and vision and the motivation for each influencer.  They position solutions according to the impact on the business and address value for each influencer.</p><p> If you embrace consultative selling, or a similar approach, then defining what that means should encourage your people to embrace the word &ldquo;sales&rdquo; as well.  Make sure that you are specific.  Enlist your employees to help set the corresponding expectations and standards in order to promote ownership.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I have a colleague and supplier (an information technology specialist) who earns a significant part of his income fixing disasters. He gets lots of work from clients who thought they were computer savvy and capable of building their own network or website (WRONG!) or after having assembling a team of independent specialists who do not understand the overall underlying structure of a system (NOT A GOOD IDEA!)  As a result, they got themselves in all kinds of trouble, like accidentally deleting their important system files, or breaking key system components that brought their site down.</p><p> This IT guy understands my tendency to play around with the computer programs without any programming experience. As a result, he created a simple solution: while I retain complete access to all the information, I will never, ever know the passwords for any computer operation.</p><p> Entrepreneurs are not alone in thinking that they can do anything, that they can&rsquo;t afford extra resources; they think they have to do everything, are paranoid about trusting others, or don&rsquo;t think it is important enough to require a particular expertise. This approach is just simply absurd.</p><li> Running a business is complex and requires multiple and different skills. Creative and financial skills require different ways of thinking. Even with website development, many organizations lack the technical, marketing, and creative capabilities to build successful internet programs.</li><li> We generally understand the competitive issues in our product, pricing, and marketing. But ignore the need to hire the right people and resources. Hiring Uncle Al because he&rsquo;s your uncle, or taking in the cheapest labor because they&rsquo;re, well, cheap, is not a recipe for business success.</li><li> You also need diversity and innovation in your business. Using expert resources can help integrate your package and bring fresh approaches to your business. Similarly, time constraints frequently demand additional resources. Even excellent clerical help can free the entrepreneur for more important tasks. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Some specific recommendations: </strong></p><li> Understand your business strategy and the map you&rsquo;ve created, and include resource requirements in it. Don&rsquo;t accept mediocrity, because doing so can be the difference between success and failure.</li><li> Components like systems, internet, operations, customer service, marketing, and accounting require special skills and expertise. Many competent experts can be found in the freelance sites on the web.</li><li> Involve these specialists in the total operation of the business. In particular, ensure they understand their role and responsibility in affecting profit. For example, SEO and social media sites are notorious for selling programs with no understanding or concern for generating profits. One of their favorite lines is &ldquo;I will get you leads, but you have to generate the sales,&rdquo; with no responsibility for generating qualified leads. <br/>  </li><p> In summary, treat your organization, resources, and components the same way you treat your product, marketing, and branding. On the one hand, remember the chain is only as strong as the weakest link. On the other hand, excellence, in even little details, can make a major difference.</p><p> As one resource told me, &ldquo;If you think an expert is expensive, try hiring an amateur.&rdquo;</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> When we talk to companies about online marketing, some will inevitably ask, &ldquo;Why do I need a blog?&rdquo;</p><p> Because we say that a blog is a great place to answer specific questions that your buyers might have, it&rsquo;s easy to confuse a blog with an FAQ page.  Both answer questions, but a blog has some distinct advantages over an FAQ page.</p><p> FAQ pages are typically written, posted on a website, and then forgotten about. They are contrived by people at your company &mdash; not usually based on questions customers actually ask, but what people at the company think they want to know.</p><p> But what an FAQ page lacks is the catalog of in-depth content that a blog provides to readers.</p><p> <strong>  Need more reasons that a blog is good for your business? Read </strong>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/14-reasons-why-your-business-should-start-a-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   14 Reasons Why Your Business Should Start A Blog  </a> </u> .</p><p> Here are some ways that a blog is different than an FAQ page, and what a blog does differently:</p><h3> A blog is a library of information, not a single page.</h3><p> <br/> A web page with &ldquo;frequently asked questions&rdquo; are generally used to  quickly  answer a variety of questions about a specific product or service. It&rsquo;s very broad in focus and covers things like price of a service, product specifications, product usage, ordering, shipping or support.</p><p> FAQ pages are great for short questions about your offering, but a blog can provide so much more and gives you a chance to be a hub for information for your readers. Picture your blog as a library of information, ready to answer your reader&rsquo;s specific questions with depth and clarity.</p><h3> Blogs provide more detailed information and explanations.</h3><p> <br/> To get another picture of the difference between an FAQ page and a blog, we generally ask our clients to think of every possible question they get from customers. We ask them to write down these questions over a period of time, then take a chance to look back and compile them into categories. Most of the time, these questions range from inquiries about the actual product or service, to broad and general industry questions. Many of these questions could go into a single FAQ page, but many require a long-form explanation.</p><p> Unlike an FAQ page, it&rsquo;s not irrelevant to answer these specific questions in a longer form on your blog. Questions that would have little place in an FAQ page make for great blog posts. For example, if your offering is a software product, it would be interesting to write a blog post about how people commonly use the product. By writing about things that your readers care to hear about, you&rsquo;re creating a space for them to come to learn more.</p><p> Two &ldquo;frequently asked questions&rdquo; by nearly any prospect are price points and product specifications. A blog is a great place to get into the specifics of these questions that provide insight to your customers.</p><h3> Blogs have better search engine benefits.</h3><p> <br/> An added perk of a blog over a FAQ page is the value the pages that make up your blog have in terms of search engine optimization. The more pages you create on your website (i.e. individual blog posts), the more pages search engines are going to index. A search engine indexing your pages, especially optimized pages, gives you a great chance to rank in search when your readers are looking for information.</p><p> FAQ pages rarely have a chance to rank in search, mainly due to their broad focus on many topics. Individual blog posts on narrow topics have a great likelihood of being found in search &ndash; another added benefit of a blog!</p><p> <strong>  See how a blog can improve your website traffic in this </strong>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/case-study-business-blogging-improves-website-traffic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   case study  </a> </u> .</p><h3> What&rsquo;s holding you back?</h3><p> <br/> If I&rsquo;ve managed to convince you of the differences between a blog and FAQ page, it&rsquo;s time to get to work! There&rsquo;s no need to trash all the work you&rsquo;ve done answering questions on your FAQ page. You can further enhance your FAQ by using it as a hub for additional resources provided by your blog, or you can link directly to articles in your blog that clarify or go into detail.</p><p> Set your website apart from your FAQ page and create a blog full of stories, statistics, and best practices. Whether it&rsquo;s more about your industry, the people who use your products, or the type of product itself, a blog can help you delve deeper into your consumer&rsquo;s biggest concerns.</p><p> A blog gives you a chance to be highly narrow in focus. Touch on subjects at a high, broad level in your FAQ, and then delve deeper in a blog post. Use the FAQ page to link to your blog &ndash; further explaining topics to your reader, while enhancing views to your blog.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re having trouble getting started with writing blog posts, check out our  <u>  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/blog-planner-template\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog planner template  </a> </u> .

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Steve Lowrie </u> | <a href=\"http://www.lowriefinancial.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Lowrie Financial  </u> </a>  </p><p> For all the tea in China or oil in Iraq, there&rsquo;s another factor that remains equally relevant to your financial success: your own resolve to create and remain true to a personalized investment plan in the face of never-ending storms of &ldquo;breaking news&rdquo; at home and abroad.</p><h3> The Weather vs. the Climate</h3><p> <br/> Dimensional Fund Advisor&rsquo;s Australian Vice President, Jim Parker recently published an article, &ldquo; <u>  Weather vs. Climate </u> &rdquo;, in which he compares short-term versus long-term investing to reacting to the weather, versus preparing for the climate:</p><p> Notice how TV news bulletins put finance next to the weather report? In each, talking heads point at charts and intone about intraday events that are quickly forgotten. Meanwhile, the long-term wealth building story gets overlooked. Many investors feel that they are not properly informed about the financial world unless they have checked daily, or even hourly, on how the Dow, FTSE, or Nikkei have moved in the intervening period.</p><p> Parker suggests that reacting to breaking news is like changing your life&rsquo;s plans every time the wind shifts. Instead, you are best served by building your portfolio the same way you might stock up on ski coats and sweaters if you live in Toronto or additional swimwear if you are a Florida resident. Daily weather reports in any region may vary widely, but the general climate is your best source for long-term planning &ndash; for your wardrobe as well as in your investing.</p><h3> Investor, Know Thyself </h3><p> <br/> While few would argue with the logic of this analogy, there is still considerable evidence that most investors are unable to actually adhere to a reasonable long-term outlook in practice.</p><p> Instead, we succumb to behavioral traits such as recency, growing disproportionally despondent during gloomy times or unrealistically giddy when things are looking up. Losing our sense of proportion, we find ourselves unable to differentiate between transitory trends versus permanent conditions. We then make poorly timed decisions, jettisoning existing plans and chasing new ones because we cannot see past tomorrow&rsquo;s forecast.</p><p> The antidote to the challenge is to arm yourself with two lines of defense: (1) the big-picture evidence, and (2) an advisor who has pledged to remind you of that evidence whenever you may otherwise lose your resolve.</p><h3> Armed With the Evidence </h3><p> <br/> Whenever we are wondering whether a piece of financial news represents the weather or the climate in our capital markets, decades of evidence can help us decide. For example, consider this illustration depicting a number of global crises from 1970&ndash;2013 &ndash; the weather &ndash; versus the long-term market growth &ndash; the climate &ndash; during the same period. Investors who lost their resolve and tried to buy and sell according to the crisis du jourwere far less likely to capture all that the period had to offer, while incurring extra trading costs along the way.</p><br /><h3> Strengthened by the Evidence-Based Advisor</h3><p> <br/> Despite your best intentions and greatest resolve, there will still be times when breaking financial news is particularly pervasive, and you find yourself wondering: Maybe this time, it&rsquo;s different. A single misstep during these critical periods can cause considerable, lasting damage to your portfolio; these greatest moments of doubt tend to occur during alarming crises or exuberant bull runs, when the costs from trying to flee or chase the herd are stacked sharply against you.</p><p> Throughout the years, and especially when you are most likely to question your own resolve, the counsel of an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lowriefinancial.ca/who-is-lowrie-financial/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   evidence-based advisor  </a> </u>  can be invaluable in helping you look past the current conditions and consider the climate. That&rsquo;s the best way we know of for weathering the markets&rsquo; inevitable storms.</p>",

In the business, personal finance, and consumerism world, it is all about top line sales and bottom line profitability.</p><p> Thus, the most common questions from leaders at this time should be:</p><li> What is our top line performance?</li><li> What is our bottom line result?</li><li> What were our sales and/or profitability performance? <br/>  </li><p> The entire organization needs to be focused on these two realities: sales and profitability.

There is no &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; to increases in sales and profitability. Instead, the key to greater success is to examine the top and bottom line.

    "content": "Social media is still viewed in some quarters as being most relevant for B2C businesses. But if recent findings published on eMarketer are anything to go, any remaining naysayers of its benefits to B2Bs may just soon be on the lookout for edible headwear.<p> <br/> According to a recent poll conducted by KiteDesk, of the B2B sales professionals who exceeded their quotas for 2014, a large majority (74%) rated themselves as being \"highly effective\" users of social media; and more than half (56%) of those who met their sales targets said the same.</p><p> Putting this into context, the report concluded that sales reps who were savvy on social media were nearly  <strong>  seven times more likely to beat their sales targets </strong>  than those with little or no experience using the channel.</p><p> Furthermore, the research found that social media was becoming more effective at locking down specific deal; nearly two-thirds (64%) had closed at least one new contract thanks to using social media, which was up from the 54% cited three years ago.</p><p> The number of reps who closed more than six deals using social media grew from 11% in 2012 to 23% last year; and of those who exceeded their sales targets, 41% said they were able to close six or more deals as a result of social media usage.</p><p> But it wasn't just closing deals where social media proved effective. Some 75% of respondents said that it worked \"well\" or \"really well\" for nurturing leads and opportunities; two-thirds (66%) said that it was good for building a pipeline; and 54% for achieving targets.</p><p> The findings run in line with similar research that indicates the importance of social media during the B2B purchasing journey. A study conducted by Huff Industrial Marketing and KoMarketing Associates towards the end of last year found that social media helped with the vendor discovery process for nearly six in 10 US B2B buyers, whilst a SAP survey held around the same time found that 35% of global B2B buyers used social media when researching vendors and/or products.</p><p> Still not buying the arguments for B2B social selling? Before long you could find yourself in a minority of one - and with a lot more than just your hat to chew on.</p>",

I assure you right beneath the surface of these life lessons is insight that will help you advance your career.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll notice that while many items fall into categories of time, accountability, effort, and people, most are related to outlook and attitude&mdash;the two things that seem to transform everything.</p><br /><h3> Here are 34 Things Every 22-Year-Old Should Know</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s start with time, today, and the, uh, future you think you see&hellip;</p><p> 1) Treat every day as if it&rsquo;s the <strong>   first day of the rest of your life </strong>  or career.  I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s not Monday or January 1st.  The other six days of the week or 364 days of the year work too.  This means you get to box up all your so-called failures as if they never happened.  Unfortunately, this means you box up your successes too. The great news is that both of these actually cause strain which you can now let go.  Every day technically is a new beginning.</p><p> 2)  <strong>  Time is NOT money </strong> . Time is time. Money is money. Lose one and you can earn it back. Lose the other and it&rsquo;s gone forever. Does that sound like they&rsquo;re equal?</p><p> 3) &ldquo;Five-year&rdquo; plans have ruined more present moments than all other distractions combined.  You&rsquo;ll be far better off with  <strong>  fifteen-minute plans </strong> .  Not only will you be more accurate a far greater percentage of the time, but you&rsquo;ll also rarely be disappointed in the outcome because you&rsquo;ll have far fewer variables go awry.  Stay present.  You can only live life to the fullest in the moment.  The past and future are mere distractions.  Enjoy the job you have today.  You&rsquo;ll be happier and it&rsquo;s a nice stepping stone for your future.</p><p> 4) Learn how to say  <strong>  NO </strong>  at the right times.  The faster you learn this, the more happy days you&rsquo;ll live and the more productive your workdays will become.  Trust me.</p><p> Over time you&rsquo;ll make lots of mistakes and &ldquo;fail&rdquo;&hellip; but, trust me, everything you want is on the other side of fear.</p><p> 5) You&rsquo;ll make a lot of  <strong>  mistakes </strong>  in your life. You&rsquo;re better off making those errors of commission rather than omission.  When you look back, you&rsquo;ll be much sorrier for the things you didn&rsquo;t do as opposed to those you did.  Along those same lines, it won&rsquo;t matter much the choices you make as much as it will the conviction in which you make them. Be committed to everything you do.  Take the job you want even if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;risky.&rdquo;</p><p> 6) Technically, I don&rsquo;t believe there is any such thing as <strong>   failure </strong> .  Sure, the word itself is in the dictionary, but I&rsquo;ve never noticed one in my life.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t believe in what I look at.  I believe in how I see it.  Even so, I&rsquo;ll play along&hellip;the embarrassment of failure is way easier than the responsibility that comes with success.  If you think you can&rsquo;t, you won&rsquo;t.  If you think you can, you will. Even if they don&rsquo;t succeed, winners still think they did.  It&rsquo;s not delusional. It&rsquo;s called mastering your psyche. Never be afraid to try to new things.  Everything you want is on the other side of fear.</p><p> 7) There is no such thing as  <strong>  failure&mdash;part two </strong> .  The only exception to this rule is trying to please everyone.  You will certainly fail at that.  That rule is bulletproof.  No exceptions.</p><p> All I need to do is pay attention and work hard and I&rsquo;ll find the success I&rsquo;m looking for. Right?</p><p> 8) Open your eyes and  <strong>  stretch your ears </strong> .  Something happens every moment.  When you&rsquo;re talking it&rsquo;s impossible to experience the moment.  It&rsquo;s as if your brain shuts off when your mouth is moving.  The only exception is screaming on the downslide of a rollercoaster ride.</p><p> 9) I tend to notice two types of people&mdash;those that are  <strong>  disciplined and everyone else </strong> .  100% of the people in the first group eventually become successful.  Some of the people in the second group do as well.  Remember, what you do everyday matters more than what you do once in a while.  Promotions don&rsquo;t happen because of one big success.</p><p> 10) Hard work doesn&rsquo;t guarantee results.   <strong>  Smart work </strong>  increases the likelihood of good results.  Concentrate on what you do along the way and embrace the journey with no attachment to the outcome.  You&rsquo;ll enjoy yourself more and likely have better results.  You&rsquo;ll also avoid disappointments that could result from faulty expectations.  Technically speaking, any outcome that didn&rsquo;t occur the way you thought it would means you had faulty expectations.  Faulty expectations arise for two reasons&mdash;you can&rsquo;t see the future and you developed those expectations without all the necessary information. Don&rsquo;t expect people to buy the best product.  Don&rsquo;t expect your boss to be fair.  Don&rsquo;t expect life to be fair.</p><p> 11) Intelligence is overrated.  <strong>  Talent is really overrated </strong> . You only need three things to be successful&mdash;Passion, Vision, and Commitment. Contrary to what people think, you&rsquo;re not born with passion.  It&rsquo;s grown.  Vision isn&rsquo;t seeing into the future.  It&rsquo;s making the future happen the way you want it to.  Commitment is the most important item.  It makes up for any shortcomings of the other two.  Live every workday to the fullest.  When it&rsquo;s over think about how it&rsquo;s moving you toward where you want to be.  At any moment, don&rsquo;t be afraid to change your career.</p><p> 12) You can have endless dreams, but not endless  <strong>  priorities </strong> .  It&rsquo;s a great lesson for life, love, and upward management of your boss.</p><p> 13)  <strong>  School does not equal education </strong> . Going to school helps you earn a degree. You know you have one when you can ethically place the letters after your name such as Andy LaCivita B.S.er of Everything.  If you have to pay for someone to teach you something&mdash;anything&mdash;that&rsquo;s not education. That&rsquo;s paying for a degree or certification or whatever. Real education occurs when you do something you love for free or by the good graces of some employer and get paid for it. No one can teach you more than you. No one can teach you more than you. It was worth saying twice.</p><p> 14) Own your stuff.  <strong>  Take accountability </strong> . The world would be an easier place to live if everyone did so. The word &ldquo;fault&rdquo; could be eliminated from the dictionary. That&rsquo;d make me smile because then no one would be trying to assign it when they should first look in the mirror.</p><p> People make the world go &lsquo;round. Sometimes you need them and sometimes you don&rsquo;t. But, all the time, watch who you befriend&hellip;</p><p> 15) You  <strong>  don&rsquo;t need a mentor </strong> .  No one cares about your life or your career more that you do.  You can outsource a lot of things, but living your life isn&rsquo;t one of them.  Managing your career isn&rsquo;t one either.</p><p> 16)  <strong>  Leaders </strong>  build more leaders, not more followers.  &ldquo;A&rdquo; players hire and develop &ldquo;A&rdquo; players.  &ldquo;B&rdquo; players hire and don&rsquo;t develop &ldquo;C&rdquo; players.  Protecting your turf might last for a while, but when your reign is over you&rsquo;ll be far less developed for surrounding yourself with less talent.  If you&rsquo;re the smartest person in the room, go find another room.</p><p> 17) Keep  <strong>  everyone&rsquo;s phone number </strong> &mdash;even the people you dislike.  They might be helpful someday. If given the choice between knowing the right person or having your MBA, remember that friends hire friends before they hire credentials.</p><p> 18)  <strong>  Never treat your subordinates poorly </strong> . I assure you someday they will be working at company you&rsquo;re trying to get into. It&rsquo;s also possible that someday you&rsquo;ll be reporting to one of them.</p><p> 19) Here&rsquo;s an  <strong>  average </strong>  for you. You become the average of the five people you spend the most time with&mdash;especially at work. Think about that.</p><p> Even if you did nothing I previously mentioned, staying true to your instinct and keeping a positive outlook and attitude will set you in the right direction&hellip;</p><p> 20) Apply the <strong>   transitive property </strong>  often. It will lead you to valuable deductions such as The More Things You Have In Your Life = The More Upkeep = More Stress AND Just Enough To Make You Happy &gt; Never Satisfied = More Days You&rsquo;ll Live Happily.   Another one of my favorites is The More Bells &amp; Whistles Your Product Has = The More Complicated It Is To Operate = The Less People That Buy It.</p><p> 21) Always listen to your  <strong>  inner voice </strong> . It&rsquo;s smart. It&rsquo;s correct far more times than the external voices you hear.  If the business deal sounds bad, it likely is.  If it sounds good, but feels bad, it likely is bad too.</p><p> 22) Everything is as it&rsquo;s  <strong>  supposed to be </strong> .  The sooner you accept that, the happier you&rsquo;ll be.  Everything that happens in your personal and work life caused you to do certain things&mdash;for good reason. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Look back at your life or your career. I guarantee there is a pattern that connects the dots. If you&rsquo;re not happy with the pattern, there are two things to consider. First, you&rsquo;re probably not looking hard enough. Second, your future is spotless.</p><p> 23) The more people who tell you something is wrong, the more right you probably are.  The degree to which something is right for you usually is inversely proportional to the number of people who tell you it&rsquo;s not.  It&rsquo;s also easier to believe a lie you&rsquo;ve heard a thousand times than the truth you&rsquo;ve heard once. Never hesitate to follow your  <strong>  instinct </strong>  and create a path for your life and career.  If it feels like a bad idea in your gut, it is. There&rsquo;s also no need to confirm your gut with anyone else. Never feel the need to subscribe to one of society&rsquo;s pre-canned menu options for life or work. We only grow as a society when people choose to be different. You&rsquo;ll never grow as a person without doing the same.</p><p> 24) You will be  <strong>  happy </strong>  because of what you think not what happens to you. If you&rsquo;re conditionally happy, you&rsquo;ll have less happy days. My way, you&rsquo;re happy every day. Happy people accomplish more, learn more, and are more fun to be around. Someone once asked me, &ldquo;How can you be so happy so often?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Because I always think I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m always right about that.</p><p> 25) Experience doesn&rsquo;t always lead to  <strong>  good judgment </strong> &mdash;gathering all the facts and making completely informed decisions does. Listening to another&rsquo;s experience before you attempt something can be helpful. But, remember, when they did that something they did it without your one constant variable&mdash;YOU. Applying the transitive property that I love, this means that you can&rsquo;t experience anything without actually experiencing it yourself. What makes you think the outcome would ever be the same when you insert yourself into the player&rsquo;s seat? Different variables lead to different outcomes&mdash;better and worse.</p><p> 26)  <strong>  Life isn&rsquo;t always fair. </strong> Over the long run, however, the universe is incredibly balanced. Karma also has no deadline.</p><p> 27) <strong>   Patience </strong>  is not a virtue. It&rsquo;s learned. Don&rsquo;t ever confused patience with being worn down or not caring. They&rsquo;re not the same.</p><p> 28) There&rsquo;s no shame in  <strong>  quitting </strong> . Winners do it all the time. They just know the right time to move on. It&rsquo;s usually right before things turn really sour. It&rsquo;s also never before they&rsquo;re about to a make a breakthrough. In that sense, timing might not be everything, but winners sure know how to set a clock.</p><p> 29) You  <strong>  get back what you give off </strong> . Sending good things out into the universe and building a bank of goodwill is better than any checking account with a seven figure balance.</p><p> 30) <strong>   Comparison </strong>  is a recipe for mediocrity. If your goal is to be &ldquo;better than&rdquo; someone else or you grade life on a curve, you&rsquo;ll never reach your true potential because you&rsquo;ll feel you&rsquo;ve reached it when you&rsquo;ve surpassed someone. Usually that only means you&rsquo;re leaving something on the table. Comparison kills.</p><p> 31) When giving or receiving  <strong>  advice </strong> , remember that advice is typically a person speaking to his or her younger self.  For example, it took 30 items for me to realize my 46-year-old self is dispensing advice to my long-gone 22-year-old self. Oh. And, remember, free advice doesn&rsquo;t cost you anything until you act on it.</p><p> 32)  <strong>  Question everything. </strong> Not in an insubordinate but an inquisitive way. Once you know the &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve increased your chance of fixing the problem by 87695%.</p><p> 33) Nothing is  <strong>  original </strong> . I&rsquo;m sure anything I&rsquo;ve just written has been written or dispensed before. Everything that needs to be said has already been said. We just need it repeated because no one was listening the first time. I think that happens because of this recurring dream I keep having. I&rsquo;m driving down a highway and see the big green town road sign on the right as I zip past. The sign says, &ldquo;Welcome To The Town of NO ONE CARES&hellip;Population 7 Billion.&rdquo;</p><p> 34)  <strong>  If you never try </strong>  you&rsquo;ll never know. Not knowing is my biggest fear. Only those willing to go too far can actually know how far they can truly go. Life was meant to be lived. Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late to start.</p>",

    "link": "difficult-conversations-build-trust-how-to-talk-to-your-clients-about-fees",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Discussing fees is never easy. When I started my first business I found talking about fees extremely difficult. To say, &ldquo;this is how much I am worth&rdquo; and then to have the confidence to deliver was hard. So I tended to prevaricate, talk about hourly rates or successes. Eventually, of course I learned that to build trusting relationships, I had to be up front about fees. But it is human nature to avoid that which is difficult.</p><p> Advisors are no different, while they will talk about fees in the abstract &ndash; like 1% of assets, they are less likely to say, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll be $3,000 per year.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because 1% sounds reasonable while $3,000 is a large number and it sets up expectations for a certain level of service. What do I get for that? How often? When? What happens if&hellip;?</p><p> Can you image Tiffany saying, &ldquo;that wedding ring will be 1% of the cost of the wedding&rdquo;, not $3,000, or your BMW dealer saying &ldquo;the car will be 1% of your earnings over several years rather than $50,000?&rdquo; You&rsquo;d probably think they are trying to, &ldquo;pull a fast one.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Yet financial advisors have been stating fees like this for years. A recent study of investors showed that <strong>  31% of those surveyed thought they were paying no fees and even those who were aware there was a fee, rarely knew exactly how much they were paying. </strong> <br/> <br/> It stands to reason that when these clients find out exactly how much they are paying in fees, there are likely to be a lot of uncomfortable discussions unless advisors get out in front of it. Those who haven&rsquo;t already done so had better start the discussion before new regulations make it unavoidable.</p><p> <strong>  How to start the conversation </strong></p><p> Be honest. State in clear language, not jargon, not just percentages but in dollars and cents, the actual fees they are likely to pay.</p><p> For example:</p><li> Currently, our fees are, 1% of assets, which is $3,000 per year for someone with your asset level.</li><li> That&rsquo;s neither the highest nor lowest available in the market place.</li><li> The percentage you pay is tied to your asset level so it can range from 2% to 0.5%, which is $6,000 down to $1,500 (if you do it yourself).</li><li> As your account grows, the percentage you pay decreases. <br/> For instance, <br/> - with assets of $500,000, fees are calculated at 0.0085% which is about $4,250 <br/> - at $1 million fees are calculated at 0.0075% which is about $7,500 <br/> - at $2 million and above fees are calculated at 0.0065% which is about $13,000 <br/>  </li><p> Give them a copy of your fee structure and offer to review it with them. Go slowly, pay attention to the level of comprehension of your client. Be prepared to stop and answer questions. Never be condescending if they need something repeated.</p><p> However, don&rsquo;t be surprised if, when they hear the actual dollar amounts, you get some push back. You need to understand that the fees you disclose will be seen in terms of the service you provide. Fortunately this can present a perfect opportunity to outline the value of your service.</p><p> Tell them what your fees include, such as listening to them and understanding what&rsquo;s important to them. Let them know, that with your expertise you can deliver the best strategies for getting them to their goals, that you will discuss the plan with them on a regular basis and that you are committed to monitoring how their portfolio is doing against the plan and make adjustments along the way as needed.</p><p> At this time you can ask them outright, if they are happy with your service, or is there anything else, within reason, that you can do for them to make for a better relationship. Then be prepared to follow through.</p><p> <strong>  The take away: </strong> <br/> Discuss fees sooner rather than later, put fees into the context of the service you provide, be clear (plain language, no jargon), be thorough, make sure you are understood and put everything in writing. </p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

    "content": "<p> Is your entire company - executives and employees alike - aligned with and around the customer?  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Do they know who your customers are? Do they understand the customer experience? How are you getting employees immersed in the customer experience? What tools or approaches have you been using? Are you looking for some new tools to help with this? </strong> <br/> <br/> And are you still struggling to get buy-in, to get company leadership on board with focusing on the customer?  You're not alone if you are, trust me.  <br/> <br/> A couple years ago, I  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/09/help-my-execs-dont-get-it.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wrote about several different ways  </a> </u>  to get executive buy-in for your customer experience initiatives and to get a commitment from them to focus the organization on the customer and on driving change to better the customer experience. We know that having  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/02/the-7-deadly-sins-of-customer-experience.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   executive commitment is critical to the success  </a> </u>  of any CX strategy. Without it, you'll never get resources - human, capital, or other - that you'll need to execute. So I'm always happy to share different ways for you to ensure your executives and employees are on board and can walk in customers' shoes, thereby helping them to really understand the experience and buy into the need to fix things. <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeanneBliss\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jeanne Bliss  </a> </u>  writes about a different approach to achieve customer understanding and organizational alignment: the customer room. It's not new; she  <u>  wrote about customer rooms </u>  five years ago. This year, though, she devotes a few pages in her new book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119047609/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1119047609&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=customerbliss-20&amp;linkId=35J5OH7HJ2CE62UA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chief Customer Officer 2.0: How to Build Your Customer-Driven Growth Engine  </a> </u> , to this topic and includes an example from The Irvine Company. I love that she describes the customer room as a visual storytelling tool, \"a way for your leaders and organization to step through customers' lives.\" That's exactly what it is - a way for executives and employees to take on the customer's persona and walk in his shoes. <br/> <br/> The customer room will contain details about the customer ( <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/04/do-you-know-who-your-customers-are.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  personas </a> ) and the customer journey; it will include artifacts from that journey, including screenshots, pictures, relevant tools and processes that the customer uses or interacts with (e.g., invoices, order forms, contracts, letters or emails, etc.), recorded customer calls, customer feedback, and more, so that executives and employees can experience the journey themselves - from the customer's viewpoint. It's like a customer journey map that's been brought to life; the room is used to help executives and employees step through the journey, and to educate, brainstorm, and redesign the experience. Create the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/11/18-reasons-to-map-customer-journeys.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   journey maps  </a> </u>  first and then build the customer room; then print your maps and hang them on the walls of the room. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Customer rooms are used for: </strong></p><li> building executive commitment</li><li> educating and aligning the organization</li><li> understanding the customer and his experience</li><li> building empathy for the customer</li><li> onboarding new employees</li><li> training employees on an ongoing basis</li><li> shifting organization thinking to outside-in from inside-out</li><li> providing inspiration for experience redesign efforts</li><li> brainstorming and making improvement suggestions</li><li> recognizing employees and teams after improvements are implemented</li><p> <br/> <strong>  Jeanne lists four benefits of engaging executives with customer rooms. Customer rooms allow them to... </strong></p><li> Connect the dots to ROI: executives prove they care about the reasons for customer retention and attrition.</li><li> Care about the customer: executives can walk in customers' shoes and experience what they experience as they try to achieve some task with the organization; it helps them build empathy for the customer.</li><li> Focus, prioritize, and commit: it brings leaders together, to work together in a united manner on those few priorities that matter most to the customer; it gets everyone to focus on those initiatives critical to the overall experience versus siloed efforts on disparate initiatives.</li><li> Drive accountability and reward the middle: create a cycle of accountability for those tasked to lead customer experience improvement initiatives. <br/>  </li><p> I think it's pretty straightforward to see how customer rooms are a valuable tool for your organization. If you can't get everyone out into the field to experience what customers experience, bring the experience to them. <br/> <br/> Other than  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerthink.com/build-your-customer-room-drive-customer-experience-focus-accountability/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Irvine Company  </a> </u> , customer rooms are being used by companies like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.customerexperienceinsight.com/if-the-customer-experience-wont-come-to-your-employees-take-it-to-them/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cigna.com/pdf/Fall09_G1CignaREPRINT.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cigna  </a> </u> ,   <u>  Prime Therapeutics </u> ,  <u>  TD Ameritrade </u> , St. Jude&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospitals, and Bombardier Aircraft. <br/> <br/> Have you found any interesting or unique ways to get executive commitment or to build empathy for your customers? Have you thought about building a customer room? <br/> <br/> There's a difference between interest and commitment. When you're interested in doing something, you do it only when it's convenient. When you're committed to something, you accept no excuses - only results. -Ken Blanchard</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Millennial investors are extremely bullish about U.S. stocks, but are, at the same time, fearful about the possibility of a correction, according to a  <u>  Natixis Global Asset Management poll </u>  conducted earlier this year.</p><p> The survey found that while most younger investors believe the market will continue to produce its current high returns, they are also worried about their inability to protect themselves should a downturn occur.</p><p> Although the stock market has historically provided returns of around six to seven percent after inflation, investors notoriously tend to focus on recent performance, instead of considering longer-term trends. As a result, many Millennial investors expect to continue to see returns of 9.8% after inflation: 87% of the NGAM Poll&rsquo;s respondents, in fact, thought it was realistic to expect those return to continue.</p><p> &ldquo;Investor&rsquo;s expectations for stock market returns are far too high&rdquo; according to Kevin Noblet of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/10/wealth-adviser-expectations-are-way-too-high/\" target=\"_blank\">   Wall Street Journal  </a> </u> .</p><p> While most baby boomers, and Gen X&rsquo;ers remember the plunge of &rsquo;08 very well, many Millennials do not. It has been six years since the markets bottomed during the financial crisis of 2009, so younger Millennials who have just begun working or investing have only experienced bull markets.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-financial-media-hypothesis-fmh/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Allan Roth  </a> </u> , the founder of an investment advisory firm and author of How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street, suggests we &ldquo;overweight recent events and discount events that occurred years earlier&rdquo;.  This may help to explain why &ldquo;so many investors felt fearless in 2007 and put so much in stocks, only to panic and sell after the 2008 plunge&rdquo;.</p><p> The poll also reveals a disconnect between the high returns younger investors expect to be getting and their actual risk tolerance, with 73% of those surveyed reporting feeling conflicted between pursuing high returns and preserving capital.</p><h3> Overly Optimistic but Extremely Risk Averse Investor Paradox</h3><p> <br/> While Millennial investors have been extremely conservative with their investments relative to other generations, they have also shown a significant amount of optimism on their views of future stock market returns.</p><p> The returns on the market since 2009 may have given investors unrealistic views of the stock market&rsquo;s long-term return potential while, at the same time, the crash that preceded this bull market may have made some Millennials overly conservative.</p><h3> The Most Fiscally Conservative Generation</h3><p> <br/> This highlights an interesting paradox created by the financial crisis: while many Millennials describe themselves as highly optimistic as a result of the returns they&rsquo;ve seen after the 2009 recession, many of them are also overly conservative, with overweighted positions in cash or other conservative investments.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ubs.com/content/dam/WealthManagementAmericas/documents/investor-watch-1Q2014-report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   UBS  </a> </u>  has, in fact, referred to Millennials as &ldquo;the  <u>  <a href=\"http://marketrealist.com/2015/02/millennials-hold-cash-older-generations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   most fiscally conservative generation  </a> </u>  since the Great Depression,&rdquo; with the younger generation holding a significantly higher percentage of their portfolios in cash than older generations.</p><p> Millennials have already experienced two major bubbles &ndash; the housing bubble and the dotcom bubble &ndash; in their lifetime and have, in many cases, become concerned about significant market drops. This is reflected in ultra conservative  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ubs.com/content/dam/WealthManagementAmericas/documents/investor-watch-1Q2014-report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   portfolio allocations  </a> </u>  that &ldquo;reflects wariness about financial markets&rdquo; according to UBS. (8)</p><h3> Finding the Middle Ground</h3><p> <br/> Dan Kadlec, a financial journalist for Time Magazine, says that while &ldquo;young adults have been the most conservative investors since the Great Recession&hellip; they are now cozying up to stocks at three times the pace of boomers.&rdquo;</p><p> According to Manhattan Ridge Advisors, a wealth management firm based in New York, when coming up with an investment strategy investors need to take into account both the level of return they are hoping for as well as their tolerance for risk.</p><p> &ldquo;The goal is to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.manhattanridge.com/blog/develop-an-investment-strategy-that-reflects-your-tolerance-to-risk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   create a balanced risk/return profile  </a> </u>  that fits your current financial situation and goals, while generating the best possible return over the life of the investments.&rdquo;</p><p> A realistic strategy for Millennials would be to find a middle ground between overly conservative and overly optimistic. While the stock market&rsquo;s future returns are unknown, the current level of 9.8% above inflation is significantly higher than the S&amp;P&rsquo;s long-term historical average and isn&rsquo;t a trend that can be counted on. Still, even with returns that are slightly lower than the current one, the market has still done well for realistic investors over the long run.  </p><p> <u>  If you had invested </u>  in the S&amp;P 500 at the beginning of 1985, 30 years ago, for instance, you would have had over 25 times what you put in by the end of 2014.  The S&amp;P 500 Index is representative of domestic markets and includes the average performance of 500 widely held common stocks. Individuals cannot invest directly into an index. The return information above is inclusive of dividends. Exclusive of dividends, the annualized growth rate is 12.31.</p><p> The important thing for investors is to recognize the risk and potential rewards that can come from different forms of investments and then to choose an appropriate asset allocation to reflect the level of risk with which they are comfortable.</p><h3> The Silver Lining for Millennial Investors</h3><p> <br/> One bright spot of Millennials&rsquo; response to the financial crisis is that they are much better at saving money and avoiding debt than previous generations.</p><p> According to the Wall Street Journal the total  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/11/20/millennials-wary-of-borrowing-stuggling-with-debt-management/\" target=\"_blank\">   debt among young adults  </a> </u>  is at its lowest level in 15 years. Additionally many millennials seem to be doing a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.benefitscanada.com/news/millennials-saving-more-than-other-generations-65585\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   better job at saving  </a> </u>  money than previous generations with a significantly larger percentage reporting that they are good savers compared with those of either Generation X, or the Baby Boom Generation.</p><p> This helps explain why the Natixis poll found that 47% of millennials were very confident that they were on the right track for retirement compared with only 27% of baby boomers.</p><p> Another thing Millennials have on their side is time: Millennials have many productive years ahead of them to save and build their nest eggs. Getting advice from a financial advisor is a great way to help ensure a savings and investment strategy will be on target with how they are living now, but will also help ensure that savings grow to meet their individual long term goals.</p>",

    "link": "6-things-you-should-know-about-your-credit-cards",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Did you know that the average adult in the US has a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-debt-statistics-1276.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   total of $5,596 in consumer debt  </a> </u> ?</p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to see from that statistic alone why credit cards get a bad rap. If you&rsquo;re not careful with how you use credit, it could wreak havoc on your finances in a variety of ways.</p><p> You might rack up so much debt it will take you years to pay off. You might end up paying thousands in interest, to the detriment of your other financial goals. Your credit score might get damaged in the process. There&rsquo;s a lot that could go wrong if you don&rsquo;t use credit responsibly.</p><p> But here&rsquo;s the thing: credit cards don&rsquo;t have to be bad. Using a credit card doesn&rsquo;t mean an automatic road to bad consumer debt. But you can end up with that outcome if you don&rsquo;t educate yourself about your credit cards before you use them.</p><p> So start smart! Learn about credit and how your plastic works before racking up any charges on your account.</p><h3> How to Use Your Credit Cards the Financially Wise Way</h3><p> <br/> First, treat your credit card like a debit card. Don&rsquo;t charge more than you can afford (no matter what your credit limit is). Be mindful of how much you have in your bank account so you don&rsquo;t end up in a situation where you can&rsquo;t afford to pay your balance. You want to be able to pay it off in full every month.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also a good idea to keep your balance low. If you have a credit limit of $5,000, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should have a balance of $4,500 at the end of the month &mdash; even if you can afford it. How much debt you owe is factored into your  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/what-millennials-need-to-know-about-their-credit-score/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   credit score  </a> </u> . If you max out your cards, your credit score may suffer.</p><p> It goes without saying you should make timely payments. If you don&rsquo;t, you can get hit with a late fee and a ding on your credit. Set a reminder to pay your bill, or set up automatic payments.</p><p> Lastly, only buy what you need. This goes back to treating your credit card like a debit card. Credit is not free money. You&rsquo;ll have to pay at some point or another. Only use your credit card for routine shopping and planned purchases  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/back-to-basics-with-the-b-word/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   within your budget  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Understanding APRs and Fees</h3><p> <br/> There are a few key terms you should know when using credit cards. Being informed will save you from making some  <u>  costly mistakes </u> .</p><p> One of the most important things you should understand is the annual percentage rate, or APR. If you fail to pay your balance in full, you&rsquo;ll be charged the APR on all or part of your remaining balance. This means what you originally purchased for $20 might end up costing you $25 next month.</p><p> As another example, if your credit card carries a rate of 20%, you&rsquo;ll pay $20 for every $100 you charge. This is why paying your balance off in full every month is critical!</p><p> You want the lowest APR available, but beware of promotional offers. Some cards have low introductory rates for a year which increase afterward.</p><p> A number of credit cards, especially those that promise rewards or points, also have annual fees. This fee will be charged during your first billing cycle, although some products will waive the fee for the first year and start charging it in the second year. Read the fine print before signing up for a credit card if you want one without an annual fee.</p><p> Late fees also apply if you fail to make a payment within a certain time period (usually 21 days). If you&rsquo;ve previously made timely payments, you may be able to get a late fee waived, but don&rsquo;t count on it. Late fees are capped at $25 for first-time offenders and $35 for frequent offenders under  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/credit-cards/credit-card-act/feb2011-factsheet/\" target=\"_blank\">   the Credit Card Act of 2009  </a> </u> .</p><h3> What&rsquo;s Up with Minimum Payments?</h3><p> <br/> When you receive your statement, you&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s a minimum payment you can make. Minimum payments look manageable compared to your balance most of the time, but you have to factor interest into the equation.</p><p> Any time you leave a portion of your balance unpaid, interest will accrue on that balance. If you continue making charges on your card, while paying the minimum owed, you won&rsquo;t be able to catch up to paying your balance off.</p><h3> A Word on Rewards Cards and Reward Points</h3><p> <br/> You might have heard about the benefits of rewards cards. When you make purchases with a rewards card, you acquire points to redeem for travel, cash back, and other goods. Sounds like a nice deal, right?</p><p> Yes, but only if you follow the guidelines mentioned earlier. Don&rsquo;t charge everything you can think of in the name of getting points.</p><p> Credit card companies are able to offer these bonuses because of people who use credit irresponsibly. They&rsquo;ll end up having to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/stop-living-paycheck-to-paycheck/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pay interest on their balances  </a> </u> , and the free money ends up not being free after all.</p><p> Keep in mind that credit card companies don&rsquo;t provide you with a &ldquo;deal&rdquo; to be nice &mdash; there&rsquo;s a reason they offer reward points. They earn a profit off the interest rates charged to those who don&rsquo;t (or can&rsquo;t) pay off balances.</p><p> Rewards cards and the points you can &ldquo;earn&rdquo; only benefit you if you limit yourself to everyday spending you already planned for. The moment you start charging more to your card in an effort to grab more points is the moment that rewards cards become a threat to your financial situation.</p><h3> One Big Upside of Credit Cards</h3><p> <br/> Credit cards come with many &ldquo;safety&rdquo; features that other methods of payment lack. When you charge something on your credit card, it doesn&rsquo;t immediately deduct anything from your checking account and you&rsquo;re not out any cash until you pay that credit card bill.</p><p> This is a good thing in terms of guarding against fraudulent activity and mistakes on your statement.</p><p> If you paid with cash, you may or may not get that money back. You can always dispute a charge on your credit card. And if you pay with a debit card? Remember, this is similar to cash and the money in your account is taken out as soon as that transaction posts.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a victim of fraud or want to dispute the charge, you may or may not get that money back.</p><h3> Should You Use Your Credit Cards?</h3><p> <br/> Many people are staunchly against using credit when you could stick with your debit cards or use only cash. And there&rsquo;s a good reason for this: if you can&rsquo;t manage your finances or control your spending, your credit cards can fast-track you  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-pay-down-debt-as-a-couple/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   into financial disaster  </a> </u> .</p><p> But while that&rsquo;s a possibility, it isn&rsquo;t the rule for credit card users. There are many advantages and reasons why others prefer using credit over debit or cash.</p><p> As with many personal finance issues, there may not be one right answer as to whether or not you should use credit cards. If you&rsquo;re struggling to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/4-bad-money-habits-that-could-be-ruining-your-finances/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   develop good money habits  </a> </u> , it might be smart to stick to cash or debit for now until you can better manage your money.</p><p> If you take the time to educate yourself about how credit cards work, do what you need to do in order to use them responsibly, and you already keep a budget and track all your spending, a credit card can be a useful tool in your financial toolbox.</p>",

    "content": "<p> They all came to the conference with the possibility of learning about the new trends in the industry and seeing their colleagues. They were willing to sit through many sessions with an eye to bring back new ideas and lessons to each of the firms they lead. They were all leaders in their own right, with courage and vision. These were the leaders I had the privilege of presenting to on &ldquo;Why Leadership Matters&rdquo; recently in New Orleans.</p><p> It is never easy being vulnerable and sharing the truths of what is happening in our workplaces. To expose the challenges we face each day can feel risky and uncomfortable. But that is exactly what happened during my presentation, as a group of highly committed senior leaders patiently waited for their turn to speak into the microphone. As each partner spoke, the room remained silent, with an occasional chuckle and a chiming in of &ldquo;Sounds like my firm.&rdquo;</p><h3> So what three questions did I pose to the leaders?</h3><li> How do we lead the teams we have?</li><li> What is preventing us from leading?</li><li> What would great leadership look like? <br/>  </li><p> Strong leadership is the key to an organization&rsquo;s survival. When senior leaders model strong leadership, their team members will be empowered to lead from wherever they are.  </p><p> In fact in a 2012 study entitled,  <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18317\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   The Value of Bosses  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  conducted by the U.S National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the findings suggest that good bosses and managers can impact the performance of a team significantly.</p><p>  What they found was:</p><li> Replacing a bad boss with a good one increases productivity of each direct report&rsquo;s output by more than 10%.</li><li> Replacing a boss who is in the lower 10% of boss quality with one who is in the upper 10% of boss quality increases a team&rsquo;s total output by about the same as adding one worker to a nine-member team.</li><li> Workers who are assigned to better bosses are less likely to leave the firm. <br/>  </li><h3> So that&rsquo;s why leadership matters!</h3><p> <br/> The senior leaders I meet, realized that although they may be leading  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/04/06/five-ways-to-lead-an-imperfect-team/#sthash.peD8J2fS.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   imperfect teams  </u>  , </a>  they still had the ability to make a difference. These are the teams they were given and these are the teams they need to embrace. Transforming an imperfect team into a high performing team depends on strong leadership. One way that can begin to happen is by cultivating a trusting work environment where both leaders and team members walk the talk, following through on what they say they will do. It also involves leaders sharing their mistakes and failures as well as the lessons they learned from them.</p><p> Are you ready to lead and transform your team or workplace? How have you become a good boss or leader?</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Ever wonder how much gold has ever been exhumed in the history of the world? The  <u>  <a href=\"https://forms.thomsonreuters.com/gfms/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   GFMS Gold Survey  </a> </u>  estimates that the total amount is approximately 183,600 tonnes, or 5.9 billion ounces. If we take that figure and multiply it by the closing price on June 16, $1,181 per ounce, we find that the value of all gold comes within a nugget&rsquo;s throw of $7 trillion.</p><p> This is an unfathomably large amount, to be sure, yet it pales in comparison to total global debt.</p><p> According to management consulting firm  <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/debt_and_not_much_deleveraging\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   McKinsey &amp; Company  </u>  , </a>  the world now sits beneath a mountain of debt worth an astonishing $200 trillion. That&rsquo;s greater than twice the global GDP, which is currently $75 trillion. If we were to distribute this amount equally to every man, woman and child on the face of the earth, we would each owe around $28,000.</p><p> More surprising is that if gold backed total global debt 100 percent, it would be valued at $33,900 per ounce.</p><p> Try convincing your gold dealer of this next time you want to sell a coin.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/mini-infographic-gold-debt-06-2015.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"5.9 Billion Ounces. Estimated amount of gold ever mined. $200 Trillion. Amount of global debt. $33,900.

For thousands of years, in countless cultures around the world, gold has been recognized as an exceptional store of value and, as such, accepted in all forms of transactions. A  <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/0608/Ancient-trade-route-shows-gold-s-enduring-power\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   new archeological discovery  </u>  , </a>  in fact, shows that the metal was being traded in the British Isles as far back as 2500 B.C., an entire millennium before the world&rsquo;s first gold coins were minted in what is now present-day Turkey.</p><p> Up until the twentieth century, most nations were still using the gold standard. Just as most music is composed in a particular key signature to control tonality, the gold standard has historically provided long-term stability and inflationary controls. Even so, several financiers and central bankers throughout history tried experimenting with a fiat currency system, a decision which often led to major imbalances between monetary and fiscal policies, and eventually economic depressions. Last week  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11402\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   I shared two such examples  </u>  , </a>  including Scottish gambler John Law&rsquo;s four-year experiment with paper money in the early eighteenth century, which ruined France&rsquo;s economy and laid the groundwork for the French Revolution.</p><p> More to the point, the gold standard limits the amount of debt that can be issued. Forty-four years ago, when the U.S. made the switch to a fiat currency system, the federal government  <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   owed $399 billion  </u>  . </a>  Since then, outstanding debt has ballooned 4,411 percent to $18 trillion&mdash;more than twice the amount of all the gold in the world. Such massive debt levels can be reached only in a fiat currency system, where money is easy, virtually limitless and unsecured by anything tangible.</p><p> Below, you can see how dramatically all debt in the U.S., both public and private, has been allowed to soar past economic growth since the end of the gold standard.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/FT-Runaway-Debt-in-the-US-Beats-GDP-Growth_06152015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Runaway Debt in the U.S Beats GDP Growth\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/FT-Runaway-Debt-in-the-US-Beats-GDP-Growth_06152015.gif\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><h3> The $200 Trillion Question</h3><p> <br/> So how would any of this debt ever be settled were it called in tomorrow? The U.S. currently holds &ldquo;only&rdquo; 8,133.5 tonnes of gold in its reserves, a significant decline from the all-time high of over 20,000 tonnes in the 1950s. This amount calculates to about $340 billion&mdash;nothing to sneeze at, but a far cry from the current U.S. debt level.</p><p> Lately we&rsquo;ve seen several central banks repatriate more of their gold reserves from foreign vaults, most notably Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland and others. Texas is even in the early stages of creating its own gold depository, the first to be run by a state. The fact that central banks still hold the metal has less to do with &ldquo;tradition&rdquo;&mdash;as former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke put it during a Congressional hearing in 2011&mdash;and more to do with confidence in gold&rsquo;s enduring power.This is the case in other nations as well. As you can see, Japan is one of the top holders of gold, but at 400 percent, its debt-to-GDP ratio is higher than any other country&rsquo;s in the world.</p><p> <img alt=\"Countries with the largest gold holdings\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/Countries-with-largest-gold-holdings-06-2015.gif\"/></p><p> It&rsquo;s unlikely that gold will ever reach $33,900 per ounce&mdash;or even $12,000, as investing expert James Turk calculates&mdash;but the fact that supply has not kept up with debt levels suggests that prices might very well rise.</p><h3> Gold&rsquo;s Late Summer Rebound Trend</h3><p> <br/> A new report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch shows that since 2001, bullion has reached a bottom between mid-June and mid-July and rebounded thereafter. In all but two of the last 27 years, or 93 percent of the time, gold and gold equities  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11403\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   enjoyed a late summer rally  </u>  , </a>  thanks in large part to the approaching Indian festival and wedding seasons.</p><p> This helps confirm what I often write and speak about, that gold prices have historically followed seasonality trends for the five-, 15- and 30-year periods. You can see how gold troughed between June and July and then rose in anticipation of Diwali and the wedding season.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/FT-Gold-Seasonality-Holidays-01232015-lg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" 24 Hour Composite\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/FT-Gold-Seasonality-Holidays-01232015.jpg\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> According to BofA Merrill Lynch, from 2001 to 2014, the yellow metal gained 14.9 percent on average between mid-summer and mid-autumn.</p>Gold's Summer Seasonal RalliesYearStart DateGold Price per OunceEnd DateGold Price per OuncePercent Change in Gold Price2001July 30$265September 28$29310.6%2002July 29$303September 24$3267.8%2003July 16$344September 24$38913.2%2004August 12$394November 22$49914.0%2005July 14$420September 21$47212.6%2006July 14$560August 9$65016.1%2007June 12$647September 2$73413.4%2008August 15$786October 9$91316.3%2009July 8$910October 13$1,06417.0%2010July 27$1,157November 9$1,39320.4%2011July 1$1,487September 5$1,90027.8%2012July 12$1,572October 4$1,79013.9%2013June 27$1,201August 28$1,41818.1%2014June 2$1,244July 11$1,3397.6%Average   $937.8914.9%<p> Source: Bloomberg, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, U.S. Global Investors</p><p> Gold equities fared even better, posting an average gain of 23.6 percent during the same time periods.

    "content": "<p> Do you ever have the nagging feeling that you don&rsquo;t have time to really think anymore? You&rsquo;re not alone. A variety of factors have conspired to rob us of time for reflection about ourselves, our lives, and the problems and issues that our clients face.</p><h3> Today, our minds are rarely silent.</h3><p> <br/> The average businessperson receives hundreds of e-mails and voice messages a day, and vacations for many of us are action-packed weeks more likely full of family activities than opportunities for repose and contemplation. &ldquo;Multi-tasking&rdquo; is considered a badge of honor by hyperactive overachievers. Commenting on this phenomenon, one CEO wrote, &ldquo;Whenever I have a free moment now, I turn to e-mail. It&rsquo;s probably taken away the last few minutes in my life that were available for reflection.&rdquo; For many modern-day client advisors, solitude unfortunately comes only during long airplane rides, and then the time is often spent working on a laptop computer or making calls from the plane&rsquo;s phone system.</p><h3> Regular reflection, however, is a hallmark of great professionals.</h3><p> <br/> It allows you to recharge your mental batteries, see things in a new light, and tap into your creativity. Almost all of the great advisors that I have studied have found ways to get away from it all&mdash;mentally if not physically&mdash;and contemplate their and their clients&rsquo; most pressing and intransigent issues.</p><p> J. P. Morgan, who was the first relationship banker and the greatest American financier of the 19th century, was an advisor to five US presidents, the Pope, and an assortment of royalty. A notorious workaholic, Morgan drove himself and his banking partners relentlessly. He regularly escaped the hubbub of the financial markets, however, by retreating to his yacht, the Corsair. Moored far out in New York harbor, away from the frenetic pace of the Wall Street, the yacht provided Morgan a seclusion where he would take in the sea breeze, relax, and think. When trying to resolve a difficult negotiation or industrial dispute, Morgan might bring executives out to his boat for several days as his guests. There, he would listen while they talked for hours. Usually, a compromise would slowly be reached as Morgan brokered a solution.</p><p> &ldquo;I lived in solitude in the country,&rdquo; said Albert Einstein, talking about the sources of his great ideas, &ldquo;and noticed how the monotony of quiet life stimulates the creative mind.&rdquo; Some researchers in the field of creativity, in fact, believe that insight occurs during the reflection and relaxation that follows a period of intense activity and work.</p><h3> Here are some practices that I have found helpful:</h3><li> <strong>  Schedule time for reflection about your work or a particular project you're engaged in. </strong> I usually block out about half an hour. Don't answer the phone. Push your papers to the side. Doodle, make lists, draw \"mind maps\" of ideas that come to you. At the end, write down any emerging ideas.</li><li> <strong>  If you fly, use some in-the-air time to brainstorm and write lists of ideas down. </strong></li><li> <strong>  When you're alone, stop worrying and THINK. </strong> A lot of our down time is spend worrying about troublesome things in our lives or fantasizing about how we'd like our lives to be. Try to push those thoughts aside and concentrate on an issue. A friend of JP Morgan wrote, \"Morgan has one extraordinary asset: The ability to concentrate for five uninterrupted minutes on a problem.\"</li><li> <strong>  Talk out loud. </strong> Run issues by your spouse or a close family member. For many people, talking out loud helps to clarify the problem.</li><li> <strong>  Revisit things during moments of relaxation after a period of intense work. </strong> Some studies show that this is when we are the most creative&ndash;during a period of rest AFTER a prolonged period of activity. <br/>  </li><p> Where do your best ideas come from? And when do you make time for reflection?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Hanson McClain is an independent investment advisory firm that provides financial consulting services to more than 4,000 households worldwide. Headquartered in Sacramento, CA, the firm was founded in 1993 and has more than $2 billi o n in assets under management.</p><h3> The Pain Points of Paper</h3><p> Hanson McClain first set its sights on a document management system to automate costly, paper-based operations and keep pace with stringent compliance regulations. &ldquo;We were looking for a paperless system with efficient workflow, SEC and FINRA compliance and a strong integration capability,&rdquo; says Director of IT Barry Chapman II. &ldquo;We had products by Documentum and EMC, but the challenge was that they don&rsquo;t meet the strict regulatory requirements of our industry.&rdquo;</p><p> After a demonstration from Sheila McEwen of Laserfiche reseller EcoFile, Chapman learned that Laserfiche not only offered the compliance functionality the firm was looking for, but also sophisticated workflow tools to address its operational needs.</p><h3> Client Onboarding in 30 Minutes</h3><p> Client account opening is a prime example of the cumbersome processes Hanson McClain hoped to streamline. Before Laserfiche, onboarding new business involved preparing stacks of paper forms, which were individually mailed between advisors, a client service representative (CSR), the firm&rsquo;s cashiering department, the client and the custodian.</p><p> This process took three to seven days to complete, and it often delayed important client transactions. &ldquo;New account documents are extremely time sensitive, and, at times, we would have to interrupt advisors during meetings to get a signature,&rdquo; Chapman says.</p><p> Today, Chapman and his team have automated the account opening process by integrating Laserfiche with DocuSign, an electronic signature tool, Tamarac, a customer relationship management (CRM) system, and Laser App, a forms-filling tool. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p><li> Laserfiche Workflow pulls a client contact record from Tamarac CRM and routes it to Laser App.</li><li> Laser App automatically populates an electronic form with the client&rsquo;s account information.</li><li> The system automatically identifies who should receive the form next and routes it to the CSR for review.</li><li> The applicable advisors electronically sign the form using DocuSign.</li><li> The custodian and client each receive a copy of the form for final sign-off. <br/>  </li><p> Client onboarding now takes the firm an average of 30 minutes to complete, which accounts for up to a week in time savings compared to the old system. The process is not only quick, but ensures personnel accountability from start to finish.</p><p> &ldquo;If a document that requires review sits for more than 24 hours, the system emails a reminder to the responsible person,&rdquo; says Chapman. &ldquo;If the same document sits for more than 72 hours, the system emails that person&rsquo;s boss.&rdquo;</p><h3> Creating Comprehensive Compliance</h3><p> Improving operational efficiencies was only part of Hanson McClain&rsquo;s information management overhaul. The firm also needed comprehensive compliance functionality to meet the strict standards of its industry.</p><p> &ldquo;The SEC and FINRA require that firms use a certain type of document management technology, such as unalterable database software,&rdquo; says Chapman. &ldquo;Our research showed that Laserfiche&rsquo;s technology is not only the most flexible, but also offers the option to use numerous add-on features.&rdquo;</p><p> One feature that simplifies audit preparation is the event log capability of Laserfiche Audit Trail, which tracks the creation, deletion and modification of documents stored in Laserfiche. &ldquo;Our system logs every possible interaction with a document,&rdquo; says Chapman. &ldquo;Even if a document is deleted, it is still available in the repository and we can see who modified it.&rdquo;</p><p> In addition to monitoring who has altered a document, the firm&rsquo;s integration with DocuSign verifies the identity of a document&rsquo;s signer. A wide range of authentication methods, including detailed security questions, social security verification and access code protection, maintain the integrity of client transactions and ensure the signing party is the person he or she claims to be.</p><h3> What the Future Holds</h3><p> Hanson McClain looks forward to further enhancing the efficiencies it has achieved with Laserfiche. &ldquo;We are continuing to develop Laserfiche upgrades and integrations not only with systems we develop, but also with other customized systems,&rdquo; Chapman says.</p><p> For example, the firm continues to build integrations with its custom &ldquo;LFI+Web&rdquo; interface&mdash;a web extension of Laserfiche that interacts with Laser App, Tamarac and DocuSign, so advisors can carry out processes from remote locations. With further integration, Chapman also plans to reduce average account processing time from the current rate of 30 minutes to only 10 minutes.</p><p> After accounting for the productivity gains of Laserfiche to date, Chapman is confident in its value. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty astounding when you consider the time savings,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We estimate that Laserfiche saves us up to one hour per document.&rdquo; Given the firm&rsquo;s estimated average of 165 documents processed per day (many of which contain up to 4,000 pages), Laserfiche produces an annual time savings of roughly 41,415 hours.</p><p> <strong>  When asked if he would recommend Laserfiche to other financial services firms, Chapman is jokingly blunt. &ldquo;Absolutely not. Since the system is so good for our business, we&rsquo;d prefer the competition knew nothing about it.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> For more examples of how top advisory firms are using cutting-edge technology tools to maximize operational efficiency and improve client services, download your copy of the trend report, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/resource/white-paper-using-technology-to-drive-productivity-and-profitability/?utm_source=iris.localhost.lan&amp;utm_medium=ad-digital&amp;utm_campaign=6-23-15?utm_source=iris.localhost.lan&amp;utm_medium=ad-digital&amp;utm_campaign=6-9-15\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Using Technology to Drive Productivity and Profitability  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Very often I get the question from clients and sales people as to how many times one should reach out to a prospect before being viewed as a nuisance. The answer is often surprising.</p><h3> Until they respond!</h3><p> In a consultative sales environment, a prospect is a prospect as long as they don't tell you to never contact them again, which rarely happens when you adhere to certain rules.</p><p> I still do high level prospecting for a select group of clients and have been very successful engaging C-Level and mid management decision makers in meaningful conversations.</p><h3> Add Value</h3><p> The key to successful prospecting is to add value and not to sell. Nobody wants to be sold to and once people think that the purpose of an outreach is to get them to buy something, the conversation is already off to a bad start.</p><p> Prospects don't get upset when you target them frequently. They get upset when you are irrelevant, when you don't know their business and when you pitch them.</p><h3> Research</h3><p> being a business owner I get sales calls all the time and 9 out of 10 are bad. You can tell when they are dialing for dollars, the sales person didn't look up my company and what I do, they pitch a service that is not a good fit for my business and sometimes they are rude or inconsiderate.</p><p> But once in a blue moon there is this sales person who actually took the time to identify what my needs might be. That in combination with courtesy leads to a good first conversation and even if I am not in a position to buy immediately, I don't mind them staying in touch with me as long as they add value.</p><h3> Be relevant and timely</h3><p> Every sensible business person knows that they will be called on by other companies that provide services. Nobody in business will hold that against you. What they will hold against you is offering a service that doesn't meet their need and then trying to push a sale where there is no fit.</p><p> Keep in mind that people are busy. Just because they don't respond right away doesn't mean that they are not interested. They might be traveling, they might have pressing issues to deal with that are more important than responding to your outreach.</p><p> Don't give up, be relevant and stay on message.</p><h3> Persistence pays off</h3><p> Many, many times I have gotten replies from prospects acknowledging and thanking me for my persistence. People generally appreciate a professional outreach and sales people who are determined. It is expected that a good sales person will stay on course and try to engage, what is not expected and dreaded is messages that are about the product or service, rather than the value it could bring to your business.</p><p> For example, if somebody calls me telling me that they can provide leads for my business (which happens almost on a daily basis) I will probably not respond  because the message seems very broad. If they however look at my client list and tell me that they are experts in the logistics or technology field (an industry that I target), they might get my attention.</p><h3> Let your prospects opt out</h3><p> Include an \"opt out\" message in your voice or email. Tell your prospect that you understand if they don't have time, or of there is no interest and that they should call you back if that's the case. This way you give them a graceful way out and very often (you will be surprised), the prospect will get back to you, one way or another. Many times I get a response from a prospect , almost apologizing for the lack of response.</p><p> In closing, if you are professional and you do your research you response rate will increase. As long as you stay on message and you are courteous, your outreach will be appreciated. Trust me on this, in my world the average sales cycle is at least 6 months up to a couple of years. If I would give up easily, my business wouldn't survive.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Americans have been labeled everything from the Greatest Generation to Generations X, Y, and Z. Are you ready for the Centenarian Generation?</p><p> <strong>  The number of 100-years-olds has roughly doubled over the past two decades to more than 67,000 &ndash; mostly women </strong> &ndash; and the U.S. Census Bureau predicts it will double again by 2030. Just think about the implication of living for a century: retirement at, say, 65 means 35 years of leisure.</p><p> This is  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/an-anti-retirement-advocate/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   unappealing  </a> </u>  to some, unaffordable to many, and it impacts us all.</p><p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve added these extra years of life so fast that culture hasn&rsquo;t had a chance to catch up,&rdquo; Laura Carstensen, director of Stanford University&rsquo;s Center on Longevity, said during a panel discussion at a recent Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles. The best use for a additional 20 or 30 years of life isn&rsquo;t, she said, &ldquo;just to make old age longer.&rdquo;</p><p> Granted, the Milken panelists &ndash; all privileged and accomplished baby boomers &ndash; are removed from the financial and other challenges facing most older Americans. But they have thought deeply about longevity and its consequences.</p><p> The following is a summary of their musings on how we might adjust to the coming cultural tilt toward aging:</p><li> Young people need to be more engaged in the issue of increasing U.S. life expectancy, because it will affect Generation Z far more than it has today&rsquo;s older population. To engage his son&rsquo;s interest in the topic, Paul Irving, chairman of the Milken Institute&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"/category/solutions/aging\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Center for the Future of Aging  </a> </u> , said he introduced the concept of 80-year marriages. &ldquo;That started a conversation,&rdquo; he said.</li><li> The convention of committing to a single job or career might have to change as people face many more years in the labor force. But &ldquo;reinvention&rdquo; &ndash; the buzzword &ndash; can be heavy lifting for many older workers. Instead, think of late-life changes as &ldquo;drawing on midlife experience and devoting it to new ends,&rdquo; said Marc Freedman, founder of Encore.org, which recognizes older people for their contributions to society. Finding new purpose and a new  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/wanna-retire-find-a-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   passion  </a> </u>  &ndash; with or without a  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/a-short-lived-retirement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   paycheck  </a> </u>  &ndash; can inject energy into old age.</li><li> Rather than the current workplace culture that often &ldquo;discards&rdquo; seniors as no longer useful, Michael Eisner, Disney&rsquo;s former chief executive, said it&rsquo;s to every employer&rsquo;s benefit to keep them working. Eisner advocates mixing older workers&rsquo; practicality and experience with the passion of young adult colleagues.</li><li> Formal education in this country is a one-shot effort completed in childhood and early adulthood. But late-life sabbaticals, volunteering, education, or internships could become a more common way to invigorate too-long employment. &ldquo;Kids get a gap year after working so hard in high school,&rdquo; Freedman said, &ldquo;but what about their parents who&rsquo;ve been working 60-hour weeks, doing caregiving and raising their kids for 30 years?&rdquo; <br/> lkj <br/> His highly improbable proposal for funding the gap year: allow older workers to tap their Social Security benefits for a single year of retooling. In the end, it could pay off by encouraging people to extend their working &ndash; and earning &ndash; years.</li><li> Preparation for old age is a lifelong pursuit, said AARP chief executive Jo Ann Jenkins. As the number of healthy older people increases, we will have to &ldquo;think about aging in a very different way than we have in the past,&rdquo; she said. The goal is that old age be &ldquo;something to look forward to, rather than to fear.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Conversations about aging often turn to health, exercise, or the latest medical innovations &ndash; but not lifestyle challenges. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;re all running around eating kale,&rdquo; Irving said, &ldquo;we have to ask, What are we doing to engage ourselves purposefully?&rdquo;</p><p> To listen to the entire conversation, click on the above video.</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;A True Fan is defined as someone <strong>  who will purchase anything and everything you produce </strong> .&rdquo; Kevin Kelly</p><p> How cool is that?</p><p> Clients and buyers who will scoop up EVERYTHING you offer up.</p><p> How many of those do you have right now, this minute?</p><p> And how would it change your work&mdash;not to mention your life&mdash;if you had more? Many more&hellip;</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/%20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kelly&rsquo;s point in his original piece  </a> </u>  is that creators&mdash;artists, writers and musicians in particular&mdash;only need 1,000 True Fans to make a living at their art.</p><p> But if you sell expertise&mdash;advice&mdash;your magic number may be far less.</p><p> Take &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo;. His first client interaction is an assessment project that brings in an average of $2,000. Not a big-ticket item, but if the client takes the NEXT step and hires Thomas for part two, it&rsquo;s worth $35,000&mdash;a year. </p><p> And while only about 25% of his initial clients sign on for part two, precious few stop using him once they&rsquo;re on his system.</p><p> A single True Fan is worth just shy of $175,000 over the life of their relationship.</p><p> Why is that important? Because it tells Thomas how much he can afford to invest in building his client pipeline: attracting casual fans to become clients and eventually move into True Fan territory.</p><p> But let&rsquo;s agree that Thomas isn&rsquo;t the norm.</p><p> Maybe Angela is more relatable. She serves her clients on a project basis&mdash;no retainer. In a good year, she completes five to ten projects and nets $150,000 (she worries about the bad years since her work moves with the economy).</p><p> She works hard and at the end of the year, she&rsquo;s typically added three or four raving fans. And while they&rsquo;re theoretically worth about $25,000 (her average assignment), in practice she has nothing else to offer them once they&rsquo;re done with the project.</p><p> She&rsquo;s got no leverage.</p><p> And if she can&rsquo;t keep those True Fans warm when she&rsquo;s not working with them, they&rsquo;ll eventually disappear off her radar.</p><p> One solution: develop her intellectual property into new forms&mdash;perhaps a digital course, a workshop or a book. But to make her time investment pay off, she has to ensure she&rsquo;s drawing her future True Fans into her orbit. She needs to keep her fan base in motion.</p><p> For Angela, maybe it&rsquo;s a $20 book that she promotes into the hands of her next generation of clients. And then a $250 digital training program that becomes a feeder system for her 1-1 clients. While she&rsquo;d increase what her True Fans could buy from her only incrementally ($25,000 + $250 + $20), with the right content, promotion and distribution she&rsquo;d start attracting a new group of True Fans almost immediately. She literally could change her business model within a year.</p><p> Of course, there isn&rsquo;t one magical solution that fits everyone.</p><p> But take a good hard look at your revenue model, your True Fan base and how you want to spend your time.</p><p> Embedded in that trinity is your path to delighting your True Fans and creating a business you love.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annemariayritys\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Anne-Maria Yritys  </u> </a></p><p> Authenticity, in its purest sense, is the capability of remaining true to yourself and to your values. Along with integrity, which I wrote about previously, it is one of the keys for successful leadership.</p><p> As Dr. Lance Secretan teaches: <br/> <br/> Authenticity is the alignment of head, mouth, heart, and feet - thinking, saying, feeling, and doing the same thing - consistently. This builds trust, and followers love leaders they can trust.</p><p> Easier said than done in a world full of stimulus, temptations, where even the most truthful individuals easily get sucked into a vortex losing both their authenticity and direction. How do you know for sure that you have not lost your authenticity?</p><p> Signs of authenticity robbery (applies both to personal behavior and behavior towards other individuals):</p><li> Not seeing the forest for the trees</li><li> No real purpose or direction</li><li> Low self-esteem resulting in merely being a people-pleaser or some other form of emotional drainage in one self and in behavior towards other individuals</li><li> Lack of creativity, copying and taking credit for other people&acute;s work</li><li> Too high expectations upon oneself and other people</li><li> Fearful behavior resulting e.g. in loss of personal power and incapability of confronting other individuals truthfully (hiding oneself, poor communication, avoiding dialogue, incapability of taking/giving constructive criticism, avoiding conflict etc.) <br/>  </li><p> Being authentic is equal to being real, truthful, and having the capability to admit humanity, weaknesses, and vulnerability. Every great leader throughout history, and contemporarily, has become truly successful through their capability of being authentic both towards themselves and towards others. Face the fact - you have to be authentic with yourself before having the courage to express authenticity towards other individuals. Even great artists have found their success through authenticity, including actors who master the skill to penetrate in to and to live the role of their character - without losing themselves in the process. Authenticity is also an essential ingredient in brand creation, be it that you are creating a brand out of yourself, or if branding a product.</p><p> Ways of strengthening authenticity:</p><li> Learn to master your mind. I always emphasize this, and not without reason. Quoting Remez Sasson: \"Your mind is your instrument. Learn to be its master and not its slave\". Mastering one&acute;s own mind requires continuous work, throughout life. If you do not master your own mind, someone else will.</li><p> All following points are part of the art of mastering one&acute;s mind:</p><li> Practice consciousness, daily.</li><li> Focus on living in the present.</li><li> Increase simplicity in your life.</li><li> Be willing to let go, and to let energy flow freely.</li><li> Learn to say no, but also to take no for an answer.</li><li> Do not take anything personally.</li><li> Be prepared for an inward journey. Authenticity is within you.</li><li> Accept that you cannot change things forcefully, but rather through patience and diplomacy.</li><li> Always be open to learning from others, express gratitude, respect, and be thankful for all lessons coming your way.</li><li> Do not copy other people&acute;s/organization&acute;s work. Create your own. But if you still do use other people&acute;s work, remember to refer to them/credit the individual/organization.</li><li> Have respect for people, starting with having respect for you. You are here for a reason.</li><li> Learn how to overcome your fears and transform them into positive energy.</li><li> Be yourself since everyone else is already taken (Oscar Wilde). <br/> <br/> At the end of the day, it is not about what you have or even what you have accomplished. It is about what you have done with those accomplishments. It is about who you have lifted up, and who you have empowered. It is about what you have given back. (Denzel Washington). </li>",

    "title": "9 Classic Employee Retention Myths Debunked",
    "link": "9-classic-employee-retention-myths-debunked",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Turnover is a big deal. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Bureau of Labor Statistics  </a> </u>  reported that in April of 2015, a massive 2.7 million employees quit their job. And that rate has been on the rise for the past 12 months. It&rsquo;s no surprise &mdash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/183479/job-creation-index-edges-new-high-may.aspx?utm_source=Economy&amp;utm_medium=newsfeed&amp;utm_campaign=tiles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup  </a> </u>  says the job market has been experiencing great improvement since the bleak era of the Great Recession.</p><p> As more jobs are being created, employees will be tempted to seek better opportunities. Or even worse, they&rsquo;ll be poached by recruiters. So in order to hold on to your top workers, you&rsquo;ll need to start strengthening your retention strategies and find ways to improve the work environment. To kick things off for you, we&rsquo;re debunking nine myths about employee retention.</p><h3> Myth #1: It&rsquo;s all about the money</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a common misconception that employees leave for better pay &mdash; always. But when  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bamboohr.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Workplace-Deal-Breakers-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HR Bamboo  </a> </u>  picked apart the reasons why people left their jobs, it turned out that money only ranked third on the list.</p><p> From dissatisfaction with the company culture to a change in career, there are countless reasons why people choose to leave their job. But the fact of the matter is that it isn&rsquo;t always about money. So don&rsquo;t expect that you can keep your employees sticking around by fattening up their wallets.</p><h3> Myth #2: Small businesses can&rsquo;t compete against larger, big-name organizations</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s the case of the underdog getting outshined by a celebrity. It&rsquo;s true that start-ups and smaller organizations don&rsquo;t always have the resources to offer perks and amenities that big shots like Google do. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s impossible to keep your employees from getting sucked up by bigger organizations.</p><p> A study by  <u>  <a href=\"http://technologyadvice.com/human-resources-software/blog/employee-retention-and-perks-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TechnologyAdvice  </a> </u>  listed the most desired perks from employees were:</p><li> <p>  Flexible work schedule or ability to work remotely </p></li><li> <p>  Free gym membership </p></li><li> <p>  Free food or catered lunches </p></li><li> <p>  Casual dress code </p></li><li> <p>  Mentoring or developmental programs  <br/>    </p></li><p> These are all perks that small organizations can implement for little to no money. In terms of free food or catered lunches, you don&rsquo;t have to do it every day. Even having food catered once a month or holding potlucks every other week are great perks any small business can offer.</p><h3> Myth #3: You can keep employees around with high-profile awards</h3><p> <br/> You know the deal: employee of the month, bonuses, and mugs. These will surely keep people loyal to your organization, right? Wrong. As much as these awards make sense to you, they don&rsquo;t to employees.</p><p> The longer an employee has to wait to get recognized for their contributions, the more they start to feel unvalued at work. And considering that only a handful of people get chosen for these awards, imagine how many people go without receiving any recognition. Employees want recognition now, not later. So even if it&rsquo;s just a pat on the back or a quick &ldquo;hey, great work on so-and-so project,&rdquo; these simple praises will do wonders for your employees' motivation.</p><h3> Myth #4: Employees are easily replaceable</h3><p> <br/> When an employee leaves, you may think you can easily just hire on someone to fill that position. However, the cost of turnover isn&rsquo;t just about money spent on classified ads.  <u>  TalentWise </u>  discovered that when an employee leaves, they take about 70% of their knowledge with them. Not so replaceable anymore, huh?</p><h3> Myth #5: Recruitment and retention aren&rsquo;t related</h3><p> <br/> Recruitment is when you look for candidates, then bring them on board. Retention is keeping them there. When put this way, it seems like they&rsquo;re two completely different entities. But the two are actually intertwined.</p><p> Retention starts when you&rsquo;re screening candidates. During the interview. When you offer someone the job. Before you even bring someone on board, you need to determine whether or not they&rsquo;ll fit into your company culture and if this is the right job fit for their career path. If you hire someone based solely on their skills, both parties might come to find that the newcomer just can&rsquo;t mesh well with their colleagues or doesn&rsquo;t enjoy the nature of the work.</p><h3> Myth #6: You don&rsquo;t need to measure turnover</h3><p> <br/> Do numbers really matter for turnover? High or low, every company faces turnover, so you never have to worry about keeping track of how many people have left. If there&rsquo;s an actual problem within your organization, it&rsquo;ll be obvious.</p><p> Reality is, it&rsquo;s not always obvious. Whether you go from a 3% turnover rate to 30%, or the numbers just remain at 10%, the issue at hand is still that employees are leaving. You need to keep track of the ups and downs of your organization&rsquo;s turnover rate to establish a trend or get to the bottom of the issue. How will you know if you&rsquo;re actually improving your workplace or if it&rsquo;s regressing if you don&rsquo;t keep track of the numbers?</p><h3> Myth #7: Low turnover means your employees love their jobs</h3><p> <br/> Low turnover rate making you say hooray? We say nay to that. There are typically two types of people who stay at their jobs: those who actually love it and those who stay out of sheer laziness. With the hours spent looking through job postings, writing cover letters, and going to interviews, it takes a lot of effort to find a new job. And some people don&rsquo;t have the motivation to do that, so they&rsquo;d rather stay unhappy at the job they already have.</p><p> And there&rsquo;s your problem. A disengaged employee isn&rsquo;t doing your bottom line any good. You don&rsquo;t want someone who just shows up to clock in and clock out. You want someone who will put in every single ounce of effort into their work. So leverage a tool like pulsing surveys to get down and dirty into employee sentiment. You might have thought your workplace was all rainbows and unicorns, but a pulsing survey is the ideal way for employees to air their dirty laundry.</p><h3> Myth #8: The company is to blame when an employee leaves</h3><p> <br/> People are quitting. It must be the company&rsquo;s fault. The company culture isn&rsquo;t working. A process is broken. These are all assumptions that you can easily make when people quit, but the company isn&rsquo;t always to blame. Sometimes people love the company and the culture but loathe their boss.</p><p> Before promoting someone, first take into consideration how this person has recognized their peers. Do they do it often and inspire their coworkers? What about communication &mdash; do they provide clear information to their peers, or do they hoard it so they make their colleagues look bad? If they don&rsquo;t exemplify these qualities as an employee, there&rsquo;s a good chance they won&rsquo;t do so as a leader. Skills like project management can be learned, but personality can&rsquo;t.</p><h3> Myth #9: You have no control over turnover</h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t stop people from leaving. It&rsquo;s the choice they made, and you have no influence over it ... is what a bad boss would say.</p><p> Leaders do have control over turnover. If they invest in their employee&rsquo;s development, ask for their feedback and act upon it, and frequently recognize good work, then you can bet people will be willing to stick around longer. Use a tool like pulsing surveys to stay on top of employee sentiment and nip issues right in the bud. If you solve issues before they become a nightmare, you can definitely prevent a number of employees from quitting.</p><p> Quitting is typically the last resort for employees. Once they&rsquo;ve reached their limit and see no improvements in the workplace, they&rsquo;re going right out the door. So make sure you create a transparent environment that also fosters two-way communication. That way, both employees and leaders will be receptive to workplace issues and finding solutions to improve the culture.</p>",

    "content": "<p> An important and modern advancement of the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Books and Records Rule&rdquo; is the storage and review of email activity by Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs).</p><p> Emails, and their attachments, fall under the regulatory definition of &ldquo;written communications&rdquo; and therefore are subject to the archiving requirements defined within the Books and Records Rule. Additionally, CCOs are expected to ensure that the content of these electronic communications remain within regulatory guidelines and consistent with the fiduciary standard to which they are held by documenting periodic reviews of the archive.</p><h3> Email Archiving &amp; Surveillance in a Nutshell</h3><p> <br/> Your RIA needs to ensure that email with clients is preserved in an archive and regularly reviewed for compliance concerns, specifically violations of the fiduciary duty and misleading or other inappropriate communications. The Books and Records Rule for RIAs states that &ldquo;written communications&rdquo; are subject to archiving requirements of all RIAs. Specifically, written messages with clients must be kept (with some exceptions) for a period of five1 years, the most recent two of which must be stored on-site or immediately accessible from your office. As is the case with all books and records, cloud-based systems that are accessible from on-site are considered \"on-site\" since files and information stored there can be produced without traveling to another location. Email messages that fall under the Books and Records Rule are those sent or received by employees of RIAs that fall into any of these categories: </p><li> Any recommendations or advice proposed or given</li><li> Any receipt, disbursement or delivery of funds or securities</li><li> Communications relating to the placing or execution of any security trade <br/>  </li><p> And more generally, communications with clients regarding:</p><li> Compliance Program</li><li> Client Management</li><li> Trading </li><li> Marketing</li><li> Business Management</li><li> Potentially others, depending on your RIA&rsquo;s specific business practices <br/>  </li><p> For more detail on the Books and Records Rule, please see our  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.advisorassist.com/2013/02/the-advisorassist-cco-series-books.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   prior blog post here  </a> </u> , and also the text of the full  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/275.204-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Books and Records Rule 204-2 here  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Email Archiving  </strong> <br/> Email messages and attachments must be archived in a manner that preserves their original record state. It is the CCO's responsibility to ensure that all email records are maintained and protected from any alteration or destruction. Additionally, it is the CCO's responsibility to ensure that client communications are conducted on an email system that is being archived (that is, no personal email accounts) to ensure that future communications will be archived. The CCO should also be familiar with the email archiving system used and know how to retrieve items from it for review or to produce for regulators upon request. Similar to your other books and records, regulators allow for cloud-based, electronic storage of email messages and attachments. The key is that you can demonstrate your ability to:  </p><li> reasonably safeguard them from loss, alteration or destruction,</li><li> prevent unauthorized access from individuals outside your firm, and</li><li> retrieve archived messages in their original recorded state based on keyword searches, employees and/or specific time frames. <br/>  </li><p> Technology controls of archived email should be understood and reviewed periodically to ensure that they are reasonably configured to minimize risk of loss or destruction. Access should be reviewed as well to ensure that only those responsible for administration or review have access to edit or view the archive. Note: Your &ldquo;Inbox&rdquo; does not demonstrate the proper archiving standard expected by regulators because anyone who has access to that inbox has the ability to alter or destroy messages or attachments.</p><p> <strong>  Email Surveillance  </strong> <br/> While the Books and Records Rule requires that you keep copies of your email communications and attachments, there is no specific language in the Adviser's Act to monitor or periodically search emails. However, CCOs are expected to follow procedures to detect risks, prevent and correct violations of the compliance program, so it is considered a best practice to conduct some level of proactive surveillance in order to demonstrate that as CCO you are providing supervision to your supervised persons regarding their adherence to the RIA's compliance program.</p><p> CCOs would therefore want to implement some periodic review of the messages that are sent and received, so as to ensure compliance with SEC (or state) regulations that impose fiduciary and supervisory duties, like adherence to your Code of Ethics and advertising constraints, among others. The frequency and depth of review should be based on the structure and complexity of your RIA's business, and the CCO's familiarity or involvement with the client communications of a particular supervised person. If the CCO works closely with one but remotely with another, it would be reasonable for the CCO to apply greater supervision of the remote person's email archive messages. Finally, the CCO should document these surveillance reviews of the email archive and capture information at least regarding the time period reviewed, the number of messages in the time period, the number of messages reviewed, whether or not issues where found, and the resolution to those issues.</p><h3> Through the Regulator&rsquo;s Eyes</h3><p> <br/> Regulators will focus on two aspects of your email system: the quality of your archive, and your surveillance process. In their view, these tasks are designed to protect your business and clients from unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive data, and also to ensure that your RIA is actively monitoring its supervised persons and addressing issues internally. Regulators expect you to be able to retrieve any email sent or received that may be used to substantiate your finances, support the decisions made on behalf of your clients, or validate that you are always adhering to your fiduciary duty. The documentation of your surveillance activities should reasonably demonstrate that as CCO you are applying supervision to the communications between your supervised persons and your clients.</p><p> Recently, the SEC Commissioners&rsquo; opinion has also clarified that a RIA's obligation to produce electronic records includes employees&rsquo; personal email messages, instant messages, text messages and personal computer hard drives when they are used for business purposes. This is why it is critical to ensure that approved mediums for written communications are included in your archive.</p><p> Thinking through an advisor complaint will help define the expectations that will be placed on your RIA during an examination. Regulators are required to respond to every complaint lodged against an RIA, and in that response, they may request that you produce any and all written communications, including emails, sent and received between the RIA and the client involved. As such, you want to be confident that those records exist and are ready to retrieve. A complete history of all communications through the past five1 years in a readily accessible archive will allow you to promptly respond to the regulator&rsquo;s request and reach a resolution. Additionally, the regulators may wonder why it reached this point, and look to your policy and process of email surveillance and the business practices that surround them. Regulators want to ensure that you are reasonably monitoring your employee&rsquo;s communications that are subject to the Books and Records Rule, to verify you have a satisfactory level of prevention to internally address potential issues before they escalate. In response, you will want to provide reports and supporting documentation of email surveillance performed by the CCO of the RIA. </p><p> Most states enforce the Books and Records requirement on RIAs in a manner consistent with the SEC, but you are under the oversight of state regulators, you&rsquo;ll want to familiarize yourself with their requirements as well.</p><h3> CCO Best Practices for Email Archiving &amp; Surveillance <br/>  </h3><li> Know the different ways in which your supervised persons could exchange written communication with your clients.</li><li> Consider creating an approved technology and device list, so as to limit unauthorized use of written communications with clients and limit the scope of your RIA's technology usage for the purposes of monitoring and regulatory examination. For example, requiring that business communications and documents are transmitted only through company-owned computers or devices, or even applications such as email but not instant message.</li><li> Expect regulators will request to review personal email or messages sent, received or stored on personal devices, such as personal cell phones, so as to ensure that there is no business usage of those devices, and prepare your employees for those requests.</li><li> Periodically conduct email reviews of your archive, and try to focus on supervised persons or clients which with which you are less familiar in order to have a broad understanding of communications among all supervised persons and your firm's clients. Document all reviews conducted and parameters of the archive being reviewed.</li><li> Use keywords to try to find suspicious emails, such as by searching for keywords such as &ldquo;complaint&rdquo;, &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo;, &ldquo;superior&rdquo;, &ldquo;great performance&rdquo;, &ldquo;guaranteed performance&rdquo;, \"disappointed\", \"trick\", etc. Contact your email archiving vendor to see if they are maintaining a list for you to use.  <a href=\"http://www.smarsh.com/blog/ten-most-commonly-flagged-corporate-fraud-terms-in-email/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Here are the ten most commonly flagged fraud terms from Smarsh  </u>  . </a></li><li> Don&rsquo;t approach email surveillance and archiving as a compliance chore. The best practice in the long term is foster strong relationships between compliance and the individuals that are subject to your RIA's compliance program. For instance, ensure that compliance is represented in any discussions related to operational or technology changes, such as a new approved device for client communications and the related compliance components to authorize that device's use.</li><li> Integrate your email surveillance and archiving requirements into your RIA's technology architecture to strengthen your culture of compliance among your technology operations, and keep current with any changes in your technology policies and procedures.</li><li> Perform due diligence on vendors that provide your firm with applicable communication streams, such as cloud-based email archiving service providers, to verify they have appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. Document the results of this due diligence and include in your annual CCO report.</li><p> The Books and Records Rule generally requires records to be kept for five or more years, from the end of the fiscal year in which an entry was last made to the record, with the most recent two years being accessible from the RIA's primary office location.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Everyone has heard that you have to differentiate your firm. But is it  actually  important? And if so, how do you do it? What exactly  is  brand differentiation, anyway?</p><p> They&rsquo;re all critical questions, and they deserve some close attention. Let&rsquo;s settle in and unpack everything that professional services firms need to know.</p><h3> <strong>  Brand Differentiation Defined </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Throughout the life of your firm, you will experience significant changes in what you do.</p><p> It&rsquo;s simply the nature of professional services that the landscape is constantly changing under your feet. Your competitors will change. Your clients&rsquo; needs will change. And in the process, what may have been a competitive advantage at the start of your business may lose its relevance. Say goodbye to your competitive advantage.</p><p> This is important to remember as we think about the meaning of brand differentiation. In essence, it is your competitive advantage. It is literally what makes your firm different. But the marketplace isn&rsquo;t going to sit still for you, and what made you distinct yesterday might not set you apart tomorrow.</p><p> Differentiation is a continuous process &ndash; a matter of evaluating the marketplace and evaluating your firm to ensure that you&rsquo;re positioned for success.</p><h3> <strong>  Why is Differentiation So Important, Anyway? </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Research has shown that high-growth firms are almost  three times  more likely to have a strong differentiator. In addition to setting firms apart from their competition, a robust brand differentiation strategy allows firms to be more targeted in their marketing efforts, speaking directly to the most relevant audiences.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t have a strong differentiator, the only option left is to compete on price &ndash; and that&rsquo;s a race to the bottom. Put simply, your professional services brand&rsquo;s differentiators are among your most important assets. They facilitate your relationship to buyers and influencers and they ultimately drive your reputation and pace of growth.</p><h3> <strong>  Worn-Out Differentiators </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Identifying the differentiators that will define and drive your firm &ndash; the qualities that make up your organizational DNA &ndash; isn&rsquo;t easy. That&rsquo;s why so many businesses claim the same tired qualities as differentiators. Stop me if you&rsquo;ve heard these before:</p><li> &ldquo;Our employees set us apart.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trusted advisors to our clients.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;We strive for excellence.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;We provide fantastic client service.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;We have a proprietary process.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Perhaps your firm uses one (or more) of these would-be differentiators. You might protest that the claim is true &ndash; you really  do  have great people who provide extraordinary customer service to your clients. But this is the secret to a successful differentiator&hellip;being true isn&rsquo;t enough.</p><h3> <strong>  The Differentiation Test </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> In fact, there are three qualities every prospective differentiator must have to meet what you might call the differentiation test. They must be:</p><li> <strong>  True  </strong> &ndash; Your differentiators have to be grounded in reality.</li><li> <strong>  Relevant </strong>  &ndash; If it doesn&rsquo;t matter to your clients, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li><li> <strong>  Provable </strong>  &ndash; Anyone can claim a quality. You have to be able to prove it. <br/>  </li><p> When everyone claims that they provide great customer service, the best people, and a proprietary process, those things become a lot less relevant to your buyers. And you should ask yourself if you can  truly  prove any of them. What does it mean, anyway, to &ldquo;strive for excellence&rdquo;?</p><p> Some qualities, like having good customer service, are simply the cost of doing business. Clients expect it, but it&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re looking for specifically when they choose a new firm. In fact,  <a href=\"https://hingemarketing.com/library/article/book-inside-the-buyers-brain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  our research shows </a>  that customer service is rarely an important criterion.</p><p> The point is that a quality has to truly matter to clients during the selection process to differentiate you.</p><h3> <strong>  How to Identify a Successful Differentiator </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> We&rsquo;ve seen that brand differentiation is a critical concern throughout the life of your firm, and it is often a major challenge. The reasons are many, but they often boil down to limited or incorrect data.</p><p> Either because they haven&rsquo;t performed research or because they are making assumptions based on anecdotal information, many firms don&rsquo;t truly understand what their clients are seeking from service providers.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve seen what  doesn&rsquo;t  work, and we know that differentiation is tough. So how can you identify a real, meaningful differentiator and set your firm apart?</p><p> There are two ways to leverage a new differentiator. You can identify or  discover  a characteristic of your firm that already exists and use it to its fullest &ndash; or you can  decide  on a new differentiator. This means you can make deliberate choices to differentiate your firm.</p><p> Many people feel that it&rsquo;s difficult to find a truly meaningful differentiator, but we&rsquo;ve identified 21 distinct types of differentiators. Here are a few examples.</p><li> <strong>  Specialization in an industry </strong> . This is usually the easiest and most powerful differentiator &ndash; it literally proves itself, and by definition it is relevant to your target audience.</li><li> <strong>  Specialization in serving a specific role within your client&rsquo;s organization </strong> . Like industry specialization, this is a self-validating differentiator that can allow you to own a particular niche in the marketplace.</li><li> <strong>  Specialization in a particular service </strong> . You may be noticing a trend. It&rsquo;s tough for generalists to set themselves apart, but specialized service providers can position themselves to deliver peerless expertise.</li><li> <strong>  A focus on understanding a particular audience </strong> . More specifically, a specialization in your clients&rsquo; particular audience. That might mean &ldquo;marketing to baby boomers&rdquo; or providing financial services to self-employed millennials.</li><li> <strong>  A different business model </strong> . If you truly do things differently than your competition &ndash; offering a subscription-based service in a market that usually doesn&rsquo;t, say &ndash; you&rsquo;re sure to stand out from the competition. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Blending Differentiators </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The most effective professional services brand differentiation strategies blend several of these approaches to create something truly unique.</p><p> You might specialize in a particular industry &ndash;  and  provide a totally unique business model. Or you might specialize in providing a particular service to clients with emphasis on a given audience of theirs.</p><p> No matter what approach you take, leveraging multiple differentiators will help you stand out more, and it will make your brand differentiation more robust. When you&rsquo;ve blended differentiators, it&rsquo;s less likely that marketplace shifts will render your standout qualities less relevant.</p><p> So what does effective differentiation look like in practice? Let&rsquo;s look at a few well-differentiated industry leaders to find out.</p><p> <u>  RS&amp;H: Research-Driven, Expert-Led Transportation Specialists </u></p><p> <a href=\"http://www.rsandh.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  RS&amp;H </a>  has been at the forefront of U.S. transportation infrastructure for the better part of a century, making critical contributions in areas ranging from aerospace to highways. Though their areas of work varied, their specialty is clear &ndash; large-scale transportation infrastructure.</p><p> With a clear area of focus and a storied history of success comes another differentiating advantage:  <a href=\"https://hingemarketing.com/library/article/the-visible-expert\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Visible Experts  SM </a> . Though &ldquo;great people&rdquo; and &ldquo;a knowledgeable team&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t very effective differentiators, the presence of high-visibility experts most certainly is one. Through their high profile in your target marketplace, these figures&rsquo; expertise is demonstrable and highly relevant to clients.</p><p> This is particularly true for RS&amp;H, where the firm&rsquo;s leading thinkers have shaped several modes of transportation across the U.S. and written key documentation for the country&rsquo;s air traffic controllers. Further enriching the firm&rsquo;s brand differentiation, RS&amp;H conducts research with current and prospective clients as well as team members. A forward-looking, empirical approach is just another way they establish a competitive edge.</p><p> <u>  LBMC Security Services: Industry Specialists </u></p><p> <a href=\"http://www.lbmcsecurityservices.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  LBMC Security Services </a>  are IT security specialists, but their specialty doesn&rsquo;t stop there. They focus on one of the most dynamic and swiftly changing industries today: healthcare.</p><p> LBMC brings its clients specialized expertise in healthcare security at a time when the topic is more urgent than ever before. With a healthcare industry in flux, the rise of electronic health records, and new attention on the healthcare sector from data thieves, their clients need security partners who understand the space intimately.</p><p> Fortunately, LBMC specializes in serving healthcare organizations, and this emphasis sets them apart. Today, they&rsquo;re strongly differentiated and positioned to serve a rapidly evolving marketplace.</p><p> <u>  Summit Executive Resources: A Disruptive Model </u></p><p> One of the most powerful differentiators possible is a truly distinctive business model &ndash; and that&rsquo;s exactly how  <a href=\"http://summitexecutiveresources.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Summit Executive Resources </a>  set themselves apart.</p><p> Traditional retained executive search models have client companies paying the search firm to find the right executive talent. It can be a lengthy and costly process, and Summit saw an opportunity to flip the model on its head.</p><p> Instead, executive search candidates pay Summit for executive coaching and career development. Summit develops a rich network of top-tier talent, which they can match to companies&rsquo; needs swiftly and at no cost.</p><p> Summit&rsquo;s competitive advantages don&rsquo;t stop there. They&rsquo;ve also chosen to focus specifically on senior executive and board of director positions, and they conducted research to verify that there was a demand for their services.</p><p> Summit Executive Resources is a perfect example that differentiators are more than a way of talking about yourself. When selected and implemented effectively, they can transform your business and disrupt your marketplace.</p><h3> <strong>  Conclusion </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Like so many of the most important things in life and business, differentiation is tough. It determines not just how you describe your services, but who you are as a firm &ndash; so it&rsquo;s crucial to get your brand differentiation strategy right.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve taken a look at some common pitfalls and some strong differentiators. With this knowledge in hand, you should be ready to get started differentiating your firm &ndash; and taking the lead in your marketplace.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In real estate, it is location, location, location. In practice management it is process, process, process. What is your review process and how can you enhance your client&rsquo;s experience at your meetings? What words do you use on your agenda&rsquo;s. Creating agenda&rsquo;s are what top financial professionals use to enhance their client experience to ensure that all areas of your client&rsquo;s financial plan are covered and discuss hidden areas that may have been forgotten, such as estate planning , tax planning, wealth management or other investment planning ideas. By adding these three key words will help you implement key practice management processes into your business. The three key words are:  <strong>  1. Communication 2. Feedback and 3. Events </strong> . These processes will help you build world class communication strategies, gain valuable feedback and clone your best clients. Here is how these practice management processes work.</p><p> First, asking clients how they want to communicate and finding out their expectations ( not creating expectations) when it comes to communication. Communication has dramatically changed over the past three years, does your client want a different experience when it comes to communication. Ask five clients &ldquo;how&rdquo; questions: How satisfied are you with our communication to you? How can we improve our communication for you (and your family )? How would you change our communication? One advisor I worked with found over 100 hours of time in a calendar year by asking these questions. His clients wanted 2 hour reviews twice a year ( 4 hours per year) instead of 1.5 hours of quarterly reviews ( 6 hours per year), creating a win win experience.  <strong>  The real answer to better communication is always in your questions. </strong></p><p> Second, is creating a formal feedback process. According to Business health Pty Ltd. Of Australia, one of the most disappointing statistic of practice management is that only 15% of financial advisor practices in US and Australia have sought feedback from their very best clients. ( www.businesshealth.com.au) How you do feedback is up to you. However, put it on your agenda and make it part of your process. You can ask questions, send a detailed survey or questionnaire, or do a feedback forum with clients. But you must do some form of client feedback, ask key questions and make it a process for your top clients.Advisors who do feedback on a regular basis earn more than advisors who don&rsquo;t ( up to 33% more) according to research by &ldquo;Business Health Pty Ltd&rdquo;.  <strong>  Your best opportunity to create a unique client experience for your top clients is to ask for feedback and manage the discussion with the client. </strong></p><p> The third key word to put on agenda&rsquo;s is events. Wealthy clients want to meet their potential financial advisor before deciding on meeting with them to invest their wealth. What events are you or your wealthy clients involved in? What is near and dear to their heart such as a charity or children&rsquo;s event that you could be involved in? Top advisors target their ideal client by strategic networking or introductions from their clients. Getting personally involved and personally introduced to those high net worth clients through strategic events will help you meet your next ideal client. Making it a process for your top clients by asking them&rdquo; is there any events this year that you are involved with such as a charity golf event that I can help you out with this year? Is there any fundraising events that you are involved with?  <strong>  At the events, your client will introduce you to people they know </strong> . Small events (less than 20 people or 10 couples) can be a great way to get to meet people.</p><p> The client meeting agenda will uncover planning opportunities and keep both you and the client on track during the meeting. The three key words  <strong>  (communicate, feedback, events) </strong>  will help you potentially communicate better, find more time or build a better client experience. It will also help you meet your next ideal client. In practice management, make it a process. Keep the agenda simple. Have a bullet point list of items to discuss. Ask the client before you begin if there is anything else to add to the agenda. Then you can direct the meeting by starting at the top of the list or you can ask the client where they would like to begin. The big truth is that time is far more valuable than money. The agenda will make the time together in your meeting more valuable.  <strong>  Now you get to implement three key practice management processes, communication, feedback and meeting new ideal clients. </strong></p><p> &ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t fired with enthusiasm, you&rsquo;ll be fired with enthusiasm&rdquo;.

    "content": "<p> It is safe to say that the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-the-buyer-journey-and-why-advisors-should-care/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   buyer&rsquo;s journey  </a> </u>  has changed. Customers do most of their own research, and engage with more content online to support their decisions. In today&rsquo;s self-educated world, we know that the information pool online is vast and buyers are picking and choosing content to support their decisions and requirements.</p><p> Most people who visit your website, no matter how well-optimized it is, won&rsquo;t buy or engage with you the first time they see it. In fact, 96% of first time website visitors are not ready to buy in their journey.   So what are they doing and what does this mean for you? Ask yourself; do you have enough valuable content that can benefit your visitor even if they never become a client?</p><h3> According to Google&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> &lsquo;&rsquo;Our research has shown that, on average, business buyers do not contact suppliers directly until 57 percent of the purchase process is complete. That means for nearly two thirds of the buying process, you customers are out in the ether: forming opinions, learning technical specifications, building requirement lists, and narrowing down their options, all on their own, with minimal influence from you.&rdquo;</p><p> Sales material is not what early stage buyers are looking for when they come across your website.   Most of your website visitors come to learn, not to be &ldquo;salesmanned&rdquo;. Early stage buyers are not looking for why they should work with you over your competitors.   Early stage buyers are trying to give a name to their problem, consider what options exist, and be as educated as possible before moving forward.</p><h3> What does this mean for Advisors?</h3><p> <br/> As a result of the new buyer&rsquo;s journey, Advisors need to become teachers and thought leaders that educate their audience and earn their trust.  Some of the most successful Advisors are using  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-content-marketing-and-how-does-it-benefit-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content marketing  </a> </u>  to engage with prospects by delivering information that makes the buyer more intelligent. Successful digital marketing Advisors are using content marketing to provide their visitor with valuable content, without selling anything; that will benefit the visitor even if they never become a client.  Below, is a great chart, courtesy of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/?__hstc=241978781.93a9be1b6484496bb67f75bcb6ad39a3.1423514774889.1434650212623.1434993528761.13&amp;__hssc=241978781.1.1434993528761&amp;__hsfp=2545656383\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hubspot  </a> </u> , that outlines the different buyer stages, and characteristics of each stage of the journey.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4f55a112fb71d5926d9335ffe588f466.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"The Buyer Journey\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4f55a112fb71d5926d9335ffe588f466.jpg\"/> </a> <br/> Advisor&rsquo;s content should speak to their target audience in the midst of the learning journey outlined in the chart above. From awareness, to consideration to decision, position your business around content that addresses the problems, questions, challenges and information gaps at each stage; the goal being to seamlessly educate across the entire customer journey. Buyers are ultimately going to do business with people who have educated them and earned their trust. However, in a world where consumers are bombarded with hundreds of marketing messages a day, it is not enough to just teach; you have to teach well.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Not every company is dependent on their own proprietary technology, but many are, and often the most valuable companies have proprietary technology as their raison d'&ecirc;tre; that is, their technology is the principal justification for their existence and belief that they can control key markets.</p><p> For new ventures, technology is developed to provide a strong differentiator from existing competitors. Technology characteristically underpins the creation of inventions, innovations, new useful devices, and services.  As entrepreneurs know, new technology is appropriately and legally preserved though the securitization of patents, trade secrets, etc.  Technology also serves as a principal basis for valuing early-stage companies for purposes of investment.  </p><p> Early in the development of a new venture it is important that entrepreneurs/founders conduct their own self-evaluation (e.g., due diligence) of their technology in relation to the impact of technology on the value of their nascent startup.</p><p> Technology due diligence at the earliest stages consists of two major considerations:</p><h3> Technology Must Be Able of Being Legally Secured</h3><p> <br/> Legal rights to technology property ownership are evidenced in the form of granted nonprovisional patent(s), which is the preferred position; patent application(s), which offer the potential of being granted early in the life of the developing new venture; or provisional patent application(s), which offer merely hope for the future.</p><p> The availability of a  granted patent , perhaps as the result of the work of one or more founders, is a preferred position because it is a confirmation from a third party (the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO) that the invention has met its requirements for novelty and nonobviousness as well as other criteria. Patents can also be secured by other means, including especially license agreements. Granted patents are highly recommended for companies that anticipate seeking professional investment in their futures.</p><p> Patents in process, while not yet having the official approval of the USPTO, are valuable because the company&rsquo;s patent attorney has provided and documented the evidence needed by the USPTO to assess patentability. This same information will be useful to prospective investors, who will be tasked with judging on their own or with the help of their technical due diligence assistants whether the new invention can be patented. Therefore, the entrepreneurs and their patent attorney should develop the patent application with an eye toward its future review by potential investors. Ideally, the patent application both validates the invention to the USPTO and provides key data on potential products, markets, and uses that are persuasive to early-stage investors. This process can be challenging, so entrepreneurs should expect to provide significant amounts of background technology, competitor, and patent research to the patent attorney. That information will eventually be discovered by potential investors. At this early stage, however, the entrepreneur only needs to do that amount of research that is satisfactory to the founding team members.</p><p> The availability of one, or more than one,  provisional patent application  presents challenging problems for the new venture. Provisional patent applications often lack the detail (e.g., background, related patent searches, market information, etc.) and specificity (including especially claims) that are found in patents or patents in process. This lack of information detail leaves professional investors with great uncertainty. While professional investment based only on the existence of PPAs can occur, it will be very difficult and/or time consuming to achieve and certainly will result in reduced valuations&mdash;outcomes that are unsatisfactory to an entrepreneur.</p><p> Trade secrets can be very valuable in combination with patents; however, trade secrets may be disclosed either inadvertently or purposefully by employees (current and former) and thus, on their own, may be insufficient as a technology foundation.</p><p> For the reasons outlined above, entrepreneurs and founders should consider waiting until a granted patent is secured before seeking professional investment, though other forms of investment (e.g., founders, friends and family, etc.) can be considered. It may take two to three years to work through USPTO office actions and secure a granted patent.  This can seem like an untenable position for many entrepreneurs/founders but the lack of granted patents simply means that investors will value the new venture less because of the uncertainty of not knowing how secure the technological basis for the new venture may be.</p><p> Aside from the actual status of patents in process, there are actions the founding team can take to conduct early due diligence on the technology under development. Fundamentally, entrepreneurs and founders need to assure themselves that their technology and IP is unique; that is, it has not been done before and no person, company, or university researcher has a granted patent in the space the future company would want to do business in.</p><p> Some of this patent due diligence can be accomplished by visiting the USPTO website and conducting searches to find patents that contain keywords and phrases that apply to new venture technology. Patents identified should be carefully read and key reference documents secured and reviewed further. The effort put into patent research should be useful in revealing aspects of the new ventures technology that may already be claimed in others&rsquo; patents or, ideally, show that the new venture&rsquo;s technology (and invention) has not already been identified and claimed by others.</p><p> Discovered patents also reveal inventors (by name) and ownership; for instance, the inventor may be an employee of a company, or the patent may have been assigned to another party. These are useful pieces of information that can help guide the founding team. If the new venture&rsquo;s patent attorney is onboard, he/she may conduct a freedom-to-operate (FTO) search that can further refine those areas of the existing patent landscape that are not owned by others</p><p> If a patent is discovered that effectively includes an entrepreneur&rsquo;s idea or patent intentions, then that discovered patent may be used to guide new thinking and research, or perhaps the entrepreneur can strive to secure the patent or license the technology from the patent owner.  In any event, there is no excuse for not knowing about prior patents and their impact on the new venture.</p><p> Patents in process (including provisional patent applications) by others are not discoverable, as the patent applications are not disclosed until a patent is granted. Thus, a certain amount of risk exposure can&rsquo;t be avoided.</p><h3> Technology Must Be Able to Defend the Company&rsquo;s Chosen Markets</h3><p> <br/> The entrepreneur must determine the likelihood that current or eventual patent positions will be able to protect or defend a valuable market or market niche in which the new venture desires to serve its customers and users with new products and services. It is also understood that value creation is based on the ability of the new venture to generate profit (by selling products and services), from which investors can eventually be repaid in the form of dividends and substantial increases in the value of company stock.</p><p> With respect to the ability of the technology to defend the company&rsquo;s intended target markets from competitors, initial due diligence can be conducted using the Internet. The Internet can be searched using appropriate keywords to discover companies and people who may be working in areas similar to that of the new venture. Discovering what other companies are doing is one aspect of competitor research that is important to future marketing-and-sales plans. It would be quite normal to discover a myriad of companies (e.g., competitors) that offer products secured by various kinds of technology or possessing different technical specifications and features. This is also useful information, as it further defines those attributes of the new venture&rsquo;s expected products that can offer important advantages in the marketplace. Even at this early stage of technology due diligence, the information can lead back to granted patents or perhaps tidbits of information that may be useful in the research process. The research should also help guide the development of both broad and narrow claims for the new venture&rsquo;s patents in process.</p><p> The actions described above are properly referenced as &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; research, as they rely upon sources that were, in turn, developed from the original or &ldquo;primary&rdquo; sources of the data or information. Secondary research is based on public disclosures, and this type of research constitutes the minimum necessary, though it may not be sufficient.</p><p> Primary research is conducted through contact with people and organizations directly. Once done, that information, which may still be public, becomes part of the database owned by the future company. Primary research can consist of discussions with others at conferences, interviews with others on the telephone, e-mail exchanges from knowledgeable sources, etc. This primary research may occur incidentally between a competitor&rsquo;s employee and an entrepreneur, and even seemingly insignificant pieces of information, when combined with others sources of data, can illuminate an important piece of information.</p><p> This type of intelligence sourcing is often called G2 in the military. All companies, especially those technologically oriented, should advise their technical employees to be watchful for information about competitors&rsquo; actions, products, specifications, etc.</p><p> Government agencies and their technology area managers can be good sources of information (not confidential or secret, of course), as they are very knowledgeable of military requirements and technical approaches that they prefer based upon their continuous scanning of available technology and discussions within the military agencies with compatible interests. Discussions with technical experts and consultants can occur either informally or formally via a consulting contract of short duration. These technical experts are often well informed of happenings within markets and with applicable technology.</p><p> The research and activities of others (individuals and companies) that have not been made public constitute a risk of investing in technology that can&rsquo;t be resolved (until a long time, as measured in years, has transpired) because the information is largely unknowable by any reasonable means.</p><p> As the period of time for founders to conduct their own initial due diligence is limited, the goal of technology due diligence at the earliest stage is not just to conduct a thorough analysis of the markets, but rather to simply establish that the new venture&rsquo;s technology, inventions, and IP have a good chance of providing a basis for products and services that can be made and sold for a profit and at large enough volumes to make professional investors interested.</p><h3> Summary</h3><p> <br/> If the answer to the question of whether the technology is unique and innovative and capable of supporting the development of new products and markets is yes, then the goals of the founders&rsquo; technology initial due diligence have been achieved and the founders can continue with their due diligence on other matters.</p><p> 1. As a reminder, at this nascent stage of new venture development, founders are also busy evaluating themselves and potential products and markets, and they are beginning to think about the business model and strategies.</p><p> 2. Researching and discovering prior work, inventions, and patents in process within the university environment can be challenging. It is best to start with selected universities working in areas in common with the entrepreneur and research departmental websites and tactfully ask questions of the professorial and student researchers.</p><p> 3.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/search/\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/search/  </a> </u> .</p><p> 4. G2 is a term used in the military that refers to information and data secured from external sources (e.g., adversaries and cooperative entities, for instance) and used to guide the development of offensive and defensive strategies and tactics.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> A couple of comments, as if any more were needed, on the Greek situation.</h3><p> <br/> First, the creditors are strongly motivated to put in place a stopgap relief measurespecifically designed to last six months, because this postpones the next phase of the crisis tojust beyond the late-2015 Spanish general elections.The creditors want to avoid, at all cost, any action by Greece (over the summer) that could prove emboldening to left-wing political elements in Spain. It wouldn't be good for the neoliberal creditor agenda if, for example, Greece were to veer into default and immediately begin to make visible progress on its problems. The Germans would much prefer to keep Greece in the sweatbox between now and Christmas, as an example to other countries. <br/> <br/> A second thing to keep in mind is that government spending, in Greece, is 60% of GDP. (By contrast, it's only 22% of GDP in the U.S. and around 44% of GDP in the U.K.) Therefore, any austerity measure that results in reduced government spending will impact GDP directly. This means it is probably impossible for Greece to embrace austerity (e.g., pension cuts) and grow its GDP meaningfully. One precludes the other. <br/> <br/> Because of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-06-20/collateral-has-run-out-jpm-warns-ecb-will-use-greek-nuclear-option-if-no-monday-deal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent historic deposit outflows from Greek banks  </a> </u> , capital flow controls will likely be imposed at any moment, unless new emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) appears, in some form, today (Monday, 22 June 2015). Greek banks technically no longer meet EU collateral requirements. <br/> <br/> Note that the bank run (which has been well underway for weeks) was probably a deliberate action by Greece to get as many physical euros in circulation as possibleahead of a prolonged IMF arrears process (and/or default). <br/>  </p><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FRnmfjoigWw/VYgJVAH0OxI/AAAAAAAAD8Y/GJ5SWzsxE5w/s1600/GreeceHours.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FRnmfjoigWw/VYgJVAH0OxI/AAAAAAAAD8Y/GJ5SWzsxE5w/s400/GreeceHours.jpg\"/></a>Contrary to rumor, Greeks work long hours. (<u> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/03/13/contrary-to-what-most-people-think-greeks-work-the-longest-hours-in-europe-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\">  Forbes </a></u>)<p> <br/> This week, we'll either see a miraculous new last-minute bailout, or we'll see a bank holiday, perhaps followed soon thereafter by introduction of an IOU system or alternate currency. Once cash is blocked (and a system of IOUs is in place), Greece will be in a Schr&ouml;dinger-cat state, neither fully in the euro nor in a state of exit. To quell fears of a breakdown in the euro, ECB would probably instruct the central banks of core countries to cross-purchase peripheral state bonds (to mutualize risk) in an effort to prop up bond prices while demonstrating minimal convertibility risk. Whether this would be enough to stabilize bond prices overall (e.g. keeping Italian and Spanish bond yields below 4%) is anyone's guess. <br/> <br/> If full-on Grexit occurs (later in the summer), the Eurozone countries would no doubt take steps to shore up the euro system, for example with a scheme for area-wide bank deposit guarantees, and/or a euro-area Treasury, and/or collaboration on Eurozone fiscal initiatives (as opposed to purely monetary initiatives). The emphasis will be on not allowing \"another Greece.\"</p>",

The benefits are basic but the risks of not holding routine meetings can be catastrophic.  </p><h3> The daily team meeting has one major purpose; to align the team.</h3><p> <br/> Many things can happen during the daily course of business and keeping teams informed allows them to adjust their priorities and schedules according to events and changing company needs. Another benefit is that when information is shared, team members can also share their experiences and insight. This is an important point that many managers &ndash; specially those that do not have the hands-on expertise like some individuals on their teams &ndash; fail to take advantage of.  </p><p> Another critical benefit of the daily team meeting is that it gives team members a &lsquo;guaranteed&rsquo; opportunity to meet with their boss and bring up or escalate any issues critical to them executing their tasks. Most managers don&rsquo;t realize that in the course of the day, their schedules will not converge well with their teams, and thus the opportunity to communicate diminishes. (TIP: a good indicator that you may not be easily accessible to your team is the number of emails you receive from them).</p><h3> Risks of not holding a daily meeting can be countless.</h3><p> <br/> Not aligning teams typically results in teams working inefficiently, completing tasks that may no longer be critical, and failing to react to new urgent needs. Studies show that productivity increases when employees have aligned goals and not communicating with them consistently allows mis-alignment of goals and consequently a reduction in productivity. In a worse case scenario, not having daily meetings could even prevent members of the team from receiving safety-relevant information.</p><p> Setting up 15 minute team meeting should be reasonably easy. The operative word here is &ldquo;15-minutes&rdquo;. Individuals are typically busy; setting up daily update meetings that consume too much time may prompt individuals to stop attending regularly or not share information openly. Meetings can be held in common work areas, meeting rooms, and in case not all team members are on-site, daily conference calls will do the trick.</p>",

    "link": "financial-advisors-and-the-linkedin-summary",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When working with financial advisors on their LinkedIn profiles, a majority of them do not have a LinkedIn Summary. My inclination is to believe that the clean slate leaves many feeling overwhelmed with the daunting task of talking about themselves. What do I say to not sound dumb? Do I write this in first person or third person? Why don&rsquo;t my connections just go to my website to see what I do? Let&rsquo;s help you get answers (and some help!) on getting this important task off your social media to-do list!</p><h3> What do I say to not sound dumb?</h3><p> <br/> This is a real fear. I know many highly decorated advisors who are very smart chaps (and chappettes!) and when you hand them a pen and paper to write a few sentences about themselves, they freeze up. Think about it for a moment. We know what we do for a living, but how do we say this so we don&rsquo;t sound conceited, or worse, dumb to a potential client?</p><p> First, let&rsquo;s talk about what the LinkedIn Summary is there to do. The biggest mistake I see people doing is going right into what they do at their job&hellip;wrong! The Summary section is your chance to tell your &ldquo;why&rdquo;. Why are you in this business? Why do you like working with people and businesses? This is what make you human and people really do want to get to know you on a deeper level.</p><p> So how do we make sure you don&rsquo;t sound dumb? Just be yourself. Honestly, just be you. Come from your heart and say why you do this work. That&rsquo;s much more important than trying to sound super professional and probably unapproachable. An example is my own:</p><p> \"As the Manager of Advisor Engagement Services at Ash Brokerage, I want to share my passion of social media with the financial services professional. As a six-year-old child, I lost my mother to lung cancer. It&rsquo;s a mission of mine to tell the insurance story every day so it helps others plan for unexpected events.\"</p><p> I&rsquo;ve used a lot of keywords in this (my title, my company, what I do which is  &lsquo;social media&rsquo;, financial services, insurance).  This helps optimize my profile so Google can find me in searches, but you can read this and get a sense of who I am as a person.</p><p> Our &ldquo;why&rdquo; will evolve over time too.  When I started in the insurance community more than twenty years ago, I did not come in with a &lsquo;why&rsquo; that is as strong today. It developed through those years, and so will yours so updating your profile is very important.</p><p> If you come from your heart, you won&rsquo;t sound dumb &ndash; I promise you.</p><h3> Do I write this in first person or third person?</h3><p> <br/> You always write in first person.  Always, always, always.  This is a conversation of sorts.  If your name is John, you wouldn&rsquo;t go into a cocktail party and say, &ldquo;John likes music.  John likes horseback riding.  John believes every young family should have term insurance.&rdquo; That would make you sound dumb (look at the first question of this article!).</p><p> Write in first person.  Be conversational.  Use words from your heart.</p><h3> Why don&rsquo;t my connections just go to my website to see what I do?</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re counting on folks to go to your website for everything then you&rsquo;re not being realistic. With the shortening attention span of consumers today, you&rsquo;ve got seconds to make an impression.  Use your profile landscape to be interesting, heartfelt and informative.  If clients go to LinkedIn to find out what you do, then be sure you&rsquo;re there.  You&rsquo;re not guaranteed they will go back to search for your website and not get caught up looking at cat videos or making Amazon purchases, forgetting they were supposed to be finding out information about you.  Seize the opportunity to be relevant!</p><p> If you have questions about your profile, let me know. I enjoy talking with advisors and seeing them be more active in social media.</p><p> Be bigger, better, and more BIONIC!</p>",

Not so fast.</h3><p> <br/> At present, 37 states have legalized same-sex marriage but 13 have still banned it. Given that social security is a \"federal\" and not a \"state\" program surely same-sex couples anywhere in the U.S. should be afforded the right to receive all federal benefits, including social security, which the Supreme Court just approved, correct? Apparently that is not the case.</p><p> Although social security is a federal program it is administered at the state level. In those states where same-sex marriage is not \"yet\" legal, applications for benefits by same-sex couples are not being processed. The U.S. Attorney General's office is actively working to change that and will persist until all states recognize and process social security benefits which same-sex couples are entitled to under federal law.</p><h3> So what happens today if a same-sex couple applies for social security spousal benefits?</h3><p> <br/> Well, it depends. For example, let's assume Robert and Michael were married in MA (a state that recognizes gay marriage) and they are domiciled in MA when Robert files for spousal benefits off of Michael's record. Assuming they otherwise meet all the criteria for spousal benefits, then Robert will receive social security spousal benefits off of his spouse Michael's record.</p><p> However, if Robert and Michael (who were legally married in MA) moved to Texas (a state which still does not recognize gay marriage) and filed for social social security spousal benefits in Texas, while domiciled in Texas, they would not receive these benefits. Even though they meet all other criteria for entitlement, the social security administration in Texas will hold the claim since they were domiciled, at the time of filing, in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriage.</p><p> It's important to note, however, that same-sex couples who are domiciled in a state that does not currently recognize same-sex couples should still file for benefits in order to establish the date of their request. This way, if (and most likely \"when\") those states were to subsequently recognize same-sex marriage, couples could petition for back benefits based on their filing date.</p><h3> There remains much confusion and likely inconsistent enforcement of the rules surrounding same-sex benefits.</h3><p> <br/> For example, assume Mary and Helen were married in New York, a state that recognizes same-sex marriage. At full retirement age, while domiciled in New York, Mary files for spousal benefits on Helen's record. However, while the application is pending, Mary and Helen move to Texas and become domiciled in Texas, a state which still does not recognize same-sex marriage. Will Mary receive her otherwise eligible social security spousal benefits? Yes, Mary's claim will be approved because when it was filed Mary and Helen were domiciled in a state (New York) which recognizes same-sex marriage. The date of filing in New York is the date used to determine month of entitlement.</p><p> Although the highest court in the land has already recognized the legal validity of same-sex marriage, the battle to enforce the rights and privileges for same-sex couples continues on even in the social security system, one of the largest and most vital of federal entitlement programs. Same-sex couples share the same financial issues and challenges in retirement and have paid into the system in the same manner as heterosexual couples. They should be afforded the same rights and privileges due any legally eligible beneficiary in the social security system.  It's time for all states to enforce the legal rights and privileges of all eligible recipients of social security benefits as was clearly stated and mandated by the Supreme Court.</p>",

    "link": "the-future-of-life-are-you-life-working-or-trying-to-balance",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> We spend much of our lives being told about the golden path that we must follow. I learned about it first in a sociology class I took in high school where the teacher talked about the importance of social norms. And what better way to be socialized than to be in school? It is a time where the system tries to make you into everyone else by not only grading you on a bell curve but by having your peers accept or reject you. You either get invited to that cool party or you don't. You either get picked for that team or you don't. You have to wear the latest fashions, know the latest trends and try to act older than your age. Oh that dream of being a \"grown-up\" and having freedom sounds so absolutely mind blowing.</p><p> The system teaches you early on to conform and it doesn't stop there. When you finally graduate with one or two or three degrees then again, you must find that job will provide you eternal happiness. And you wait for some organization to realize how brilliant you are and pick you for that job so you can make money to buy a house and raise a family.</p><p> That is the formula that many generations have started to reject both consciously and unconsciously. Everyone is talking about the millennial generation, while I am one of the few Futurists who is talking about the change that is happening for people in their 40s, 50s and 60s. And it's happening fast. More and more people are hitting all the markers of success that they were sold and waking up to the question: \"this is it?\" And this is where the millennials enter center stage, as the older generation enviously see their values and the fact that they traveled more, and start questioning the path they followed.</p><p> Marketers and advertisers don't want us to figure this out as they would like us to consume more and more of their products and services. And yet, we keep building larger walk-in closets and ordering more dressers and cabinets to keep our stuff. But that stuff is not making us happy. That corner office or large cube that we earned through blood, sweat and tears is no longer enough.</p><p> We are also realizing that work-life balance is a myth and we were sold a bill of goods. We were told that we were two people: our professional self and our personal self and never should the two meet inside the workplace. We had to split and fragment ourselves and find a way to balance these two personalities. When in reality, we are one person and we want to bring our whole selves to our lives, where work is part of it.</p><p> I am personally tired of hearing people saying that we spend most of our lives at work. I have chosen the 21st century model of \"life working.\" I no longer define myself simply by what I do but who I am. I recently went to an event and put on my name tag the title of \"Janitor\" because I wanted to see who would talk to me. In the past, I had the nice big corporate tile and an affiliation with a well respected company and that's why people wanted to talk to me. This time I wanted to connect with people who could see beyond the facade and would want to get to know the real me. And that's exactly what happened as well as a lot of laughter for people who dared to talk to a Janitor. And yes, I have done a lot of clean up already in the life time.</p><p> So what is \"life working\"? It's about showing up in life as a whole person, knowing who you are and working with purpose. Imagine a world where we asked kids \"what do you love? What bugs you?\" instead of \"what do you want to be when you grow up?\" Imagine a world where we figured it out and decided to practice our art in whatever profession we later chose? Imagine if life was more important than work and we could figure out what kind of life we wanted before we were conditioned by how we would support this lifestyle?</p><p> Imagine if you were doing your life's work? Would you retire? Would you have to escape from a job you hated to have a life you loved? We would no longer have mid-life crises because we would continuously make choices and pick ourselves instead of waiting to be picked by an employer, a life partner, or friends and family. More and more people are waking up to a deep need for meaning and purpose in their lives. The changes that are coming in our world will not come from the top of the organization, they will come when more and more of us pick ourselves in life.</p><p> We have been trained to value and reward the mind and the intellect. The 21st century is about learning more about ourselves and learning to make choices that come from the heart. The heart knows how we feel and yet so often, we intellectualize our decisions. The movement that is taking place is that many of us are starting to listen to our hearts, while taking wise advice from our opening hearts.</p><p> I had dinner with an amazing woman last month. A mom of four kids under the age of seven who told me: \"I am so tired of people pitting me because my twin son has Cystic Fibrosis. Don't people understand that we all have a degenerative disease and die. Should I pity them?\" She has become a patient advocate with four kids. She is amazing and nothing stops her fight for what she knows in her heart.</p><p> <strong>  What's your life work or are you still trying to balance a myth? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;m the first to admit that dating me is not a walk in the park.</p><p> In fact, it&rsquo;s more like a walk in quicksand. It seems pretty great and then before you know it, shit gets very real and very deep.</p><p> See, most of what makes me difficult is my incessant need to be right. I don&rsquo;t care if we&rsquo;re debating the merits of $10 smoothies or whether I can run faster than the record holder for walking marathons, I like to win. (Those were both very real arguments I&rsquo;ve had, by the way).</p><p> Admittedly, neither of these topics mattered, yet I fought with such tenacity that you&rsquo;d think we were arguing about life-or-death concerns. And while I will never run a marathon faster than  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racewalking#Top_performers\" target=\"_blank\">   Yohann Diniz can walk 50km  </a> </u>  (in 3:32:33), I was fighting to prove more than my &ldquo;rightness.&rdquo; I was fighting to assert that I had value. And while I knew that my insecurities came out in crazy ways, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. Why? <br/> <br/> Knowing you want to change a behavior is not enough to fix it. It takes true awareness.</p><p> If knowledge were truly power, then we&rsquo;d all be able to read a book and excel in every area of our lives. The truth is that knowledge doesn&rsquo;t mean shit. Awareness and conscious choice are the true drivers of change.</p><h3> So How Do You Go From Autopilot To Conscious Choice?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. START WITH YOUR BELIEFS. </strong></p><p> Take a look at the things you hold to be true about yourself, your partner, your life, etc. Do this by completing the following sentences:</p><li> I am ______.</li><li> The world is ______.</li><li> Relationships are ______. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. WATCH HOW YOU CONFIRM THOSE BELIEFS. </strong></p><p> As we go through the world, information passes through an internal filter that either deletes, distorts, or generalizes what we perceive. This has positive and negative consequences. Since we&rsquo;re hardwired to feel safe, we unconsciously try our best to eliminate any information that challenges the safety of certainty. This is true even when (and especially when) our beliefs are negative. For example, when I believed I was not worthy of love, I only saw the negative things people would do. I was only attracted to or attracted men who treated me as though I were unworthy. And when someone good came along, I&rsquo;d act in a way that forced them to confirm my belief (ex. I&rsquo;d pick fights and then get upset when he&rsquo;d pull back.) To change this, you must look at how your beliefs play out from thought to reality, from start to finish.</p><p> <strong>  3. ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. </strong></p><p> This is usually the part no one likes to hear. To be clear, this does not mean you should blame yourself. Accepting responsibility is THE MOST empowering step because it allows you to take charge of your life. Taking responsibility means not externalizing the events of your life. For example, years ago I dated a man who was a narcissist. Taking responsibility for this does not mean I deserved this or that I condone his behaviors. It means I see how my belief that I was not good enough resulted in my choosing someone who confirmed my fear. When we avoid responsibility, we repeat our mistakes over and over again. Nothing changes until we have the awareness to learn from it. Personally, I&rsquo;d rather make new mistakes rather than repeat the old ones.</p><p> <strong>  4. CHOOSE THE RESULTS YOU WANT. </strong></p><p> This is where the magic happens. One you watch your process with awareness (from belief to outcome) you have the power of choice. True awareness makes it nearly impossible to continue behaviors that don&rsquo;t serve you. In this step, instead of focusing on the actions to take, focus on the outcomes you want to create. </p><p> <strong>  5. CHANGE YOUR BELIEFS TO CHANGE YOUR OUTCOMES. </strong></p><p> Changing your beliefs isn&rsquo;t easy. And it doesn&rsquo;t come from trying to find evidence to the contrary. Why? Because if you believe something, you&rsquo;ve amassed evidence to confirm it (See point #2). To change your beliefs, you need to reverse-engineer them. You can do this by choosing the outcome you want and adopting the beliefs that give you what you want. For every outcome, there is a belief that gets you there. Determine the root belief and act as if you were someone who has that belief. For example, someone who has a loving relationship believes that they are deserving of love. What are the actions a person who believes they deserve love take? Are they good at setting boundaries?  Do they they prioritize self-care? Are they effective communicators? </p><h3> Belief + Complementary Actions = Desired Outcome</h3><p> <br/> Beliefs don&rsquo;t just happen. They take time to develop, whether consciously or unconsciously. When they are examined with awareness, you have the power to create the behaviors, the outcomes, and the life that you desire.  And while it may seem like a lot of work to change your beliefs, I ask you this: Are your beliefs doing you any favors? Cause if they aren&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s time to make them work for you instead of against you. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bliberatore\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brittany Liberatore  </a> </u>  </p><p> If you were to ask any business owner to name what has affected his/her company the most in the past five years, the answer would likely be technology. Looking at the financial services industry in particular, the impact of the digital transformation in this sector is being felt everywhere.</p><p> Created by the technology revolution is the ability to tap into the power of raw data, and financial services firms are just beginning to scratch the surface. Some of them are using this to change the client experience, others are using the information to innovate the way they market themselves.</p><p> For example, one of our clients, Joe Duran, CEO of United Capital, covered digitization in the financial world and bracing for change in his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150604/BLOG16/150609961\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog series for InvestmentNews  </a> </u> . Seeing the power of tech firsthand, Joe highlighted that advisors need to evolve with how their advice is delivered. One powerful point he made: &ldquo;Digitization of our industry is not a choice. What is a choice is whether you are empowered by it or you are consumed by it.&rdquo;</p><p> Some well-known, &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; financial services firms are racing to embrace the change that technology advances have forced upon the industry, as seen in additions to their service offerings. Consider some examples:</p><li> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2015/05/05/vanguard-rolls-out-new-robo-hybrid-advisor-service-with-17-billion-in-assets/\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Vanguard announcing a hybrid robo-human money management service  </u>  . </a></li><li> <a href=\"http://www.fa-mag.com/news/fidelity-acquires-emoney-advisor-20690.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Fidelity acquiring eMoney, a wealth planning software company  </u>  . </a></li><li> <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/northwestern-mutual-lifes-learnvest-acquistion-lessons-for-rias/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Northwestern Mutual buying LearnVest, an online advice platform  </u>  .  </a> <br/>  </li><p> On the backdrop of this trend, it is no wonder that the financial services community was robustly present at our agency&rsquo;s latest media panel.</p><p> Earlier this month,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  held an event on &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.gregoryfca.com/2015/05/national-journalists-come-to.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Power of Data for Storytelling  </a> </u> .&rdquo; The panel, moderated by our founder, Greg Matusky, included  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevelohr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Steve Lohr  </a> </u> , author and technology reporter at The New York Times;  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frankiebi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Frank Bi  </a> </u> , previously at Forbes and now editorial engineer at The Verge;  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pcheung630\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Paul Cheung  </a> </u> , director of interactive and digital news production at the Associated Press; and  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erika_owens\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Erika Owens  </a> </u> , program manager at Knight-Mozilla OpenNews.</p><p> Below are two main themes these panelists covered &ndash; relating to tech and data &ndash; which financial firms should bear in mind when crafting their PR, marketing and messaging strategies:</p><p> <strong>  Data has always been around (and it is here to stay) </strong></p><p> Data has always been a part of our lives; it just hasn&rsquo;t been so readily available to back great stories &ndash; technology has accelerated the process of collecting it. Financial institutions must keep in mind that numbers can tell the story. With data, we are able to go from what our experiences and intuition may say about something, to using data to support or debunk that initial &ldquo;hunch.&rdquo; Get ready for your clients, prospects, media and peers to be looking for facts and figures on your firm. The starting point of telling your story has changed with the increased access to data.</p><p> <strong>  Data does tell the story (but don&rsquo;t forget the media)  </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s say you curated data on your client work &ndash; the next step should leveraging what you found to the media, in its entirety. Far too many times, data is delivered as an infographic, leaving the journalist with no context or comparison. When trying to harness the power of the media, let them determine the best use of data and the story it is telling. No matter how powerful the information is, we still need journalistic expertise to figure out what it means (and what readers will care about).</p><p> Financial firms must use technology and access to data as a business opportunity to stand out from the crowd. Whether it be digitization of advice, curating data sets about your business, or changing the narrative you are telling customers, technology is there to empower you. Failure to embrace that notion will spell certain doom for your business and its relevance in the market.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A behaviorally smart advisor is one who:</p><li> Knows their behavior and can adapt to others</li><li> Navigates different communication styles</li><li> Manages their own and others emotions <br/>  </li><p> How does this help an advisor to connect with more prospects?  Increased behavioral awareness helps an advisor to build the relationship on solid ground from the very beginning prospect stage.</p><p> Recent research conducted by Financial Advisor Magazine reported the top reason why clients fire an advisor is &ldquo;failure to communicate on a timely basis&rdquo;.</p><p> If you objectively uncover the prospect&rsquo;s communication style in the on-boarding process, you could specifically discuss the way and types of communication that work best for the client and then adapt your style to accommodate the client.</p><p> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s look first at the communication style. </strong>  One client might define successful communication if they are doing 80% of the talking.  Another client might want lots of facts and information to be emailed to him so he could have plenty of time to read and review.  Yet another client might define successful communication as allowing them to get right to their agenda and goals.</p><p> <strong>  Next, think about what your prospects consider to be a &ldquo;timely basis&rdquo;? </strong>  That definition can vary but it&rsquo;s best to know upfront so you can manage expectations.  An extremely goal oriented client may want responses within a few hours.  Your outgoing clients may want at least an acknowledgement with a realistic response time frame established so they know what to expect.</p><p> The truth is that most advisors communicate with their prospects using their own style; which means they are only truly connecting with 25% of their prospects. That is why lack of communication ranks as the #1 reason clients leave advisors!</p><p> <strong>  For many advisors, a great benefit of gaining more behavioral self-awareness is developing more flexibility. </strong>  Understanding that you have certain communication tendencies leads to recognition that those tendencies serve one better in some situations than others. That recognition in turn leads to a willingness to assess a prospect and situation and adjust your approach to it, if called for. Knowing what behavior you prefer to show, and what is needed, empowers advisors to choose effective behaviors.</p><p> Make a commitment to become behaviorally smart.  Because when it comes to increasing revenues in your practice, behavior will drive performance.</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;My broker showed me how great my investment performance has been over the last few years!&rdquo;</p><p> How many times have you heard&mdash;or made&mdash;that statement?</p><p> While we all know that past performance doesn&rsquo;t equate to future performance, our brains get dazzled by those 5-star rankings. Or that jaw-dropping return from last week/last month/last year. Somehow, a voice (I call it the &ldquo;Voice of Greed&rdquo;) inside us insists that it can only continue to rise. Unfortunately, that voice drowns out your other&mdash;more reasonable&mdash;source of wisdom that knows that markets don&rsquo;t only go up.</p><p> Your &ldquo;Voice of Wisdom&rdquo; will tell you that: </p><li> Star ratings are relative to what&rsquo;s hot and what&rsquo;s not.</li><li> Down years are normal.</li><li> Your stocks don&rsquo;t know you own them and don&rsquo;t care how much you REALLY want them to rise.</li><li> Every bit of public information is already factored into the price of securities&mdash;regardless of what broadcast pundits (or those who sell investment newsletters) have to say.</li><li> There is a type of risk in every security.</li><li> Trying to time the market is waste of time for all but a very, very, very small number of individuals on the planet&mdash;and YOU are not one of them.</li><li> If monkeys throwing darts at the stock page typically outperform the experts, your chance of consistent success is even worse (unless you&rsquo;re the missing link). <br/>  </li><p> Markets and performance are like catnip to cats or honey to bears&mdash;the vision of untold wealth makes us a little crazy. Our Voice of Greed shouts down the &ldquo;reason region&rdquo; of our brains. We dream of hitting the lotto, the super jackpot on the nickel slots, the trifecta (with all the long-shots). Our brains write the fantasy fiction stories of our successful financial lives.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not a bad thing, if you can keep it in check and not let that &ldquo;somebody&rsquo;s gotta win&rdquo; attitude take over. You can recover from small mistakes; the big ones can kill you. Your hunches, bets, beliefs are all skewed by your wiring and you can sometimes suffer from &ldquo;confirmation bias&rdquo;.</p><p> Confirmation bias is what happens when you start to see only what confirms what you already know or believe. Let&rsquo;s say you want to research a possible investment&mdash;a stock you&rsquo;re excited about. You&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;re coming out with a hot new product and when you scour the internet, you don&rsquo;t notice the articles that suggest just maybe this new product is too little, too late. The competition has something even more promising. You wind up seeing only one side of the situation&mdash;you buy the stock and it tanks.</p><p> The flip side is also true&mdash;you hear some bad news rumor (and selectively read those voices of gloom and doom). Before you know it, you&rsquo;re selling the stock even though it could very well be poised for a break-through.</p><p> Investopedia summarizes it nicely: &ldquo;Confirmation bias is a source of investor overconfidence and helps explain why bulls tend to remain bullish and bears tend to remain bearish regardless of what is actually happening in the market. Confirmation bias helps explain why markets do not always behave rationally.&rdquo;</p><p> Yep. We fall victim to our own thinking. And then when our (theoretically) well-conceived plan ends in disaster, we are left looking for an explanation that takes us off the hook. After all, we did our research and make a well thought out decision. Or maybe not.</p><p> Right now, markets are at record highs and speculation is rampant as to what will happen next. Instead of buying into the hype of the so-called experts, consider instead how much risk you can live with and what your time horizon looks like. Market corrections are normal&mdash;but if you are investing funds you&rsquo;re going to need in the short-term, you are probably taking too big a risk.</p><p> Maybe it&rsquo;s time to listen to your Voice of Wisdom; it might be softer than your Voice of Greed, but it might just protect you from disaster.</p>",

    "title": "How to Question for Budget",
    "link": "how-to-question-for-budget",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Qualifying for budget, or handling objections around budget and money, are areas most sales reps feel uncomfortable in.  To start with, I&rsquo;ve heard many sales reps tell me that bringing up budget or money on a qualifying call is not only uncomfortable, but that it&rsquo;s inappropriate as well.  They say, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t given any value yet, so it&rsquo;s too early to talk about budget!&rdquo; </p><p> My response is that if your product or service is out of a prospect&rsquo;s budget, or if they feel it&rsquo;s too expensive, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter how much value you give it &ndash; they aren&rsquo;t going to buy from you.  That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s crucial to qualify for budget up front &ndash; just as you would with decision maker, timeframe, etc.</p><p> And when objections about money or price come up, again, sales reps often struggle with how to handle it.  In fact, most sales reps' default response is to try to lower the price rather than either build value or help the prospect find other areas to get budget from. </p><p> Below you&rsquo;ll find a variety of ways of both qualifying for budget and asking questions to help assist you in helping the prospect find the budget.  Getting comfortable with regularly asking these questions &ndash; both during the qualifying stage and during the close &ndash; will allow you to both identify qualified prospects and help you close them. </p><p> As always, adapt them to fit your product, service or personality and practice, drill and rehearse them until they become automatic for you:</p><h3> Budget Questions during qualifying:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;How much budget do you have set aside for new advertising?&rdquo; (This week, quarter, or year)</p><p> &ldquo;How much are you currently spending to attract new consumers?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How much budget do you currently spend on keeping or retaining your existing customers?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How much have you set aside this?&rdquo;  (Your product or service)</p><p> &ldquo;What do you know about management&rsquo;s budget when it comes to adding&hellip;.&rdquo; (Your product or service)</p><p> &ldquo;Besides yourself, who else would weigh in on making a budget decision on this?&rdquo;</p><p> LAYER:</p><p> &ldquo;And what is their role (or your role) in that process?&rdquo;</p><p> LAYER:</p><p> &ldquo;And what do you know about their budget for adding a new&hellip;. (Your product or service)</p><p> &ldquo;How much of a priority is this (your product or service area) for you this month?&rdquo;  (Or quarter)</p><p> &ldquo;How much does your department (or company) spend on new client acquisition?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Our solution runs a ballpark of $10,000 up to $50,000.&rdquo;  If you liked what you saw, could you work within that range?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your budget for this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What are your plans for (your product or service area) for the upcoming season/quarter for this?&rdquo;</p><h3> Budget Questions during the close:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;What is a new customer worth, roughly, to you?&rdquo;</p><p> LAYER:</p><p> &ldquo;And how much budget, per week/month/year, have you set aside to attract those new customers?&rdquo; <br/> <br/> LAYER:</p><p> &ldquo;And how much of that budget is still not used that you could apply to this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;When something like this comes up that you believe will work for you (your department or company), how do you normally go about getting the budget for it?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How do you draw from next month&rsquo;s/quarter&rsquo;s budget to get something like this that you really know will help you?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What is your yearly budget for this area (of your product or service)?&rdquo;</p><p> LAYER:</p><p> &ldquo;And how much of that do you have left over?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Let me ask you: around this time of year, how do you handle these kinds of purchases?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Who else could you get approval from to afford this extra expense?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How do you normally get something above budget approved?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How can you borrow against next year&rsquo;s budget to get the profits and results this year?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What do you have to do now to make sure this is properly budgeted for next quarter?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What other areas/departments can you borrow from to start this service today?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;If money weren&rsquo;t an issue here, would you move forward?&rdquo;</p><p> [If Yes]</p><p> &ldquo;GREAT!  What are three ways you can think of now to get the budget for this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What did you do last time you really wanted something?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How did you get the money last time you really wanted something?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;We all have ways of getting the money when we really want something, what way do you have of getting the money now?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Who (which department) could you borrow from?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How about I put you on our low cost down payment program, and you can then set up easy monthly payments so you can get started today?&rdquo;</p><p> As you can see, there are a variety ways of not only bringing up or getting clarity around the budget issue, but of also leading your prospect to revealing how and when they can get or find the budget.  Have some fun with this and hit MUTE while you get all the answers and solutions around budget that you need!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Among the pieces that make up great marketing copy, your call to action may be the most important component of all.</p><p> And there&rsquo;s a good reason why: your call to action may be your last chance to nudge your reader to take the next step. Here are three things to keep in mind when writing your next call to action.</p><p> This may be your last chance to instruct your reader on what he or she should do next.</p><h3> 1. Use action verbs</h3><p> <br/> A call to action should avoid soft instructions, and instead incorporate action-oriented verbs. So avoid a call to action like this: &ldquo;If you are interested in finding out more about &hellip;&rdquo;.</p><p> Instead, try these three prompts when you&rsquo;re writing your next call to action:</p><p> &ldquo;Get your &hellip;&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Call us today at &hellip;&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Discover the benefits of &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> These are direct verbs that get to the point, which is what a call to action is all about.</p><h3> 2. Be clear, not clever</h3><p> <br/> Being clear and direct is more important than being clever or creative. It&rsquo;s better to have your reader think &ldquo;This is a great offer&rdquo; than &ldquo;That is a great call to action.&rdquo;</p><p> You can ensure clarity by always making your reader a priority.</p><h3> 3. Make the next step easy</h3><p> <br/> One way to make the next step easy is to provide a few ways for your reader to contact you, such as a phone number and email address. Also think about including links to your  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ExtMarketingInc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u> ,  <u>  LinkedIn </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ext-Marketing-Inc/218423031519653\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook  </a> </u>  pages.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t be sure when or how your call to action will be read, so be prepared for anything.</p><p> Easy also means quick. If your call to action requires work, like filling out a contact form, your reader may lose interest.</p><p> Nevertheless, if your call to action does require a little work, be sure to sweeten the deal by offering something for free.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If I had a dollar for every adviser who has expressed an interest in buying another advisers business I&rsquo;d be retired now.  It seems to be the primary strategy for attaining scale and a viable business of one&rsquo;s own, and there has been even greater interest since regulatory reform began in earnest.  Buying another advisers practice is usually a much more complex matter today than 5 years ago though.</p><p> Many advisers however don&rsquo;t approach the idea in a commercial fashion though. They often look at it as just picking up a few assets, or renewal income streams, to add to their existing book of business.  So it is approached as a straightforward purchase of a contractual income stream only, and more often than not the entire deal is done on a rule of thumb (renewals multiple) valuation, supported by a handshake. That works well enough if you are just buying a relatively small portfolio of business and swinging it into your existing brand and business structure, however many of those opportunities are disappearing as more financial advice practices become increasingly sophisticated and complex commercial structures.</p><p> It is becoming less common for a purchase of the income stream only, and far more common for an agency purchase to be a complete business sale which includes all the systems, people, intellectual property, assets&hellip;and potential residual liabilities. Lenders &ndash; whether it is bankers or industry institutions &ndash; are far more discerning than ever before in providing the necessary funding.</p><p> To give yourself the best chance of getting the funding and then successfully acquiring and integrating a purchase, you need to do at least the following before you are ready to buy another practice:</p><p> 1.  There must be a bigger plan. The &ldquo;plan&rdquo; is not just the agency purchase. There must be a  <strong>  strategic purpose </strong>  which makes sense commercially.</p><p> 2.   <strong>  Due Diligence. </strong>  You must have realistically assessed the book, and the business, to determine what the real quality is, together with the financial performance of the business and any governance, management or contractual issues that might be lingering.  Most importantly, you have to assess the quality of previously provided advice and understand what your exposure as the new owner may be.</p><p> 3.  A realistic <strong>   skills assessment. </strong>  Every adviser is a great business manager, right?  Right?  A realistic assessment of what skills and knowledge will be required to make this work, and what the plan is to address any skills or knowledge shortcomings needs to be done.  &ldquo;Pollyanna&rdquo; thinking just doesn&rsquo;t cut it anymore.</p><p> 4.  <strong>  How are you going to integrate? </strong>  Getting all the client data together so you have efficient communications; having a communication plan; ensuring all suppliers/institutions are onboard; working out what will happen with staffing, branding, systems&hellip;.there is a lot to think through if a takeover is going to be successful. This is where  <strong>  The Plan </strong>  does need to get quite detailed.</p><p> 5.  <strong>  The structure of the deal. </strong>  Rarely is it actually as simple as &ldquo;I will hand over $x on a particular day&rdquo; anymore.  Allowing for successful integration and retention of clients and expecting both sides to accept some of the responsibility and risk in making that happen should be factored in.  So too should specific responsibilities for prior advice and potential liabilities.</p><p> In addition, financiers will be interested in:</p><li> whether professional (external) valuations have been sought</li><li> financial modelling which is realistic having been done</li><li> the degree of vendor flexibility and involvement in the transfer <br/>  </li><p> Most purchases these days involve some serious money, and some serious risk.  For the smart professional growing a great practice acquisition remains a good strategy &ndash; provided it is done thoughtfully and makes strategic sense.</p>",

The study covers 3,113 investors from around the world, and defines the Futurewealthy as individuals who are growing their wealth quickly and have an average net worth of $2.7 million. The latest research is focused on the role of the advisor, or relationship manager: what the FutureWealthy want from their advisor, what they expect, and what they don&rsquo;t want.</p><p> The study comes at a good time. In our advisor world, it seems that when you read the trade news, half of the articles are about robo-advisors. The study gives real data about investors&rsquo; view of advisors; a view that is often glossed over by industry pundits. The world view is also interesting, as often you see regional expectations of an advisor play out differently driven by regulatory, culture, and technology environments.</p><p> The research spans wealth management, which includes banking, wirehouses, and boutique firms focused on high-net-worth clients. In this post, I will identify some of the key findings for advisors. If you want to see the entire study,  <u>  you can do so here </u> . </p><p> <strong>  Cultural differences </strong> <br/> The first finding is one of the more obvious; globally, 59% of respondents believe that the main responsibility of an advisor is to increase their financial position.</p><p> For a further 42% and 37% , the principal activity is to provide investment education and deliver market updates, respectively. If you roll this up, globally, the most desirable capability of an advisor is to help with wealth creation.</p><p> Advisor Responsibilities: Within the context of your entire relationship with your advisor, what do you view as the main responsibility of your advisor? (Regionally Segmented) <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/06/Futurewealth1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Futurewealth1\" src=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/06/Futurewealth1.jpg\"/> </a> <br/> But look at the different regions. The Americas&rsquo; Futurewealthy focus on financial wealth creation. The Asian Futurewealthy are tactically interested in having the market changes explained. Meanwhile, Europeans have a significantly higher desire for help with the decision process, the effective delivery of financial information, and mentoring (37%, 31%, and 29%, respectively). You can infer from this that Europeans are more interested in the financial planning process, compared to their American contemporaries, who are focused on investment advice.</p><p> When you look at the softer characteristics that the Futurewealthy appreciate in an advisor, the following statistics outline the regional preferences:</p><li> <strong>  Americas: </strong>  63% Integrity, 58% Intelligence, 38% Listening, and 38% Attentiveness</li><li> <strong>  Europe: </strong>  71% Professionalism and 30% Discretion</li><li> <strong>  Asia Pacific:  </strong> 40% Transparency, 40% Dedication, and 34% Authenticity <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Age differences </strong> <br/> So what do Futurewealthy groups of different ages require from their advisors? It is clear that the older segments expect their advisor to improve their financial situation, whereas the younger generations are looking for mentorship and help with the decision process.</p><p> Advisor Responsibilities: Within the context of your entire relationship with your advisor, what do you view as the main responsibility of your advisor? (Age Segmented) <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/06/FutureWealth222.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"FutureWealth222\" src=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/06/FutureWealth222-1024x666.png\"/> </a> <br/> The information yields some other interesting interpretations. Firstly, why is it that the Americas are answering similarly to the older segments, whilst the Europeans are more like millennials? Now that is counter-intuitive; you would think that the younger continent would have a more youthful approach!</p><p> The older segments have more specific opinions about what they want from their advisor; their answers range from 73% to 5%. Meanwhile, the younger segments want a broader set of services from their advisors; their answers range from 48% to 15%.</p><p> Access to guidance: Do you feel that your advisor provides you with guidance and information to make informed investment decisions? <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/06/Futurewealth3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Futurewealth3\" src=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/06/Futurewealth3.jpg\"/> </a> <br/> This question illustrates an interesting result emerging from the data. The younger the respondent is, the more they feel that they are not receiving the guidance they want from their advisor. This makes sense, when you think that until recently, most advice has been tailored to the older generations, who are perceived to have most of the world&rsquo;s wealth.</p><p> <strong>  What can we take from this research? </strong> <br/> <br/> In general: <br/> &bull; Everyone is looking for advisors who can deliver strategic advice <br/> &bull; The different continents look for that strategic advice to be provided in different forms <br/> &bull; The older segments want their advisors to increase their wealth, whilst the younger segments want a broader array of services from their advisor</p>",

Without it, there may be a scattering of important things in a business that can perhaps have us moving in too many different directions.</p><p> Maybe in your career or business you do not have one big pinnacle achievement that keeps you working hard every day for weeks, months and years. But perhaps it is a good idea. Maybe it is the sale of your business, or a crowning industry accolade? Maybe it is a family objective, a philanthropic goal &ndash; your legacy? Whatever it may be for you, having single-mindedness in this age of distraction and ADD may be just what is needed to stay on a path to your greatest success.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katedore\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kate Dore  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cashvillesky\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Cashville Skyline  </u> </a>  </p><p> One of my most vivid memories of this past holiday season was relaxing around a square table with family casually chatting about politics.</p><p> I was probably enjoying my second chocolate chip covered cannoli when my cousin halted the debate over changes in a local recycling program and friendly jabs at 2016 presidential hopefuls.</p><p> &ldquo;I have a serious question, and I&rsquo;m looking for your advice. I&rsquo;m starting a new job with a retirement plan, so I need to know,  is socially responsible investing possible ?&rdquo;</p><p> There may have been a few bursts of nervous laughter, but I was hesitant to spit out a quick reply. Quite honestly, I hadn&rsquo;t given it a great deal of thought.</p><p> It had been months since I invested any extra money and my portfolio consisted mostly of low-maintenance index funds. </p><p> Now that I&rsquo;m employed full-time again, and I&rsquo;ve waded back into investing, I&rsquo;ve wondered the same thing as my cousin.</p><p> I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;m a socially-conscious consumer, allowing my hard-earned dollars to be my voice for or against like-minded businesses. And my voice may seem small and insignificant, but should that hinder my efforts of striving to be better? Should that same mindset apply to investing?</p><p> Short answer:  it&rsquo;s complicated.</p><h3> What is Socially Responsible Investing?</h3><p> <br/> Not everyone&rsquo;s definition of socially responsible investing (SRI) is the same.</p><p> Generally speaking, socially responsible investors seek to invest in companies that share their values. There are many issues of concern, however, they can generally be summarized as &ldquo;Environmental, Social and Governance&rdquo; or ESG investing. Additionally, many of these investors care deeply about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2013/04/24/socially-responsible-investing-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">   shareholder advocacy and community investing  </a> </u> .</p><p> With US sustainable, responsible, and impact investing ballooning to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ussif.org/Files/Publications/SIF_Trends_14.F.ES.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   $6.57 trillion by the start of 2014  </a> </u> , more individuals than ever are concerned about contributing to a more sustainable and equitable economy.</p><p> There is even a  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_responsible_investing\" target=\"_blank\">   detailed method of screening securities  </a> </u>  based on certain ESG investing concerns, but are investors making the impact they think they are?</p><h3> Bloggers Weigh In</h3><p> <br/> Jason from Dividend Mantra  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dividendmantra.com/2015/03/how-ethical-can-an-investor-be/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recently dug into ethical investing  </a> </u>  and pointed out how difficult it can be to find a company whose practices you agree with 100%.</p><p> He also argued how limiting it can be to eliminate certain companies from your portfolio. He questions how much we should allow our ethics should cost us.</p><p> John from Frugal Rules also  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.frugalrules.com/socially-responsible-investing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tackled socially responsible investing  </a> </u>  recently. In his former career, he was often asked to help investors find socially responsible funds.</p><p> He describes the amount of work that is required to research a fund made up of hundreds of companies or even more frustrating, the number of companies within a conglomerate. Despite these challenges, John believes socially responsible investors will ultimately be happier with their portfolio.</p><h3> Bogleheads Discuss</h3><p> <br/> One of the most interesting and informative resources I stumbled upon is a Bogleheads forum thread discussing  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=138192\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   socially progressive fund options  </a> </u> .</p><p> The entire thread is worth reading, but here&rsquo;s the gist &ndash; a gentleman is discussing his plan to max out his Roth IRA, however, his wife insists it only consist of &ldquo;progressive industries.&rdquo;</p><p> While many commenters acknowledged that this strategy may not be the most effective method in which to enact change, they were empathetic to his wife&rsquo;s concerns about making money from businesses that she doesn&rsquo;t agree with.</p><p> The commenters made some interesting recommendations:</p><p> - Government bonds <br/> - Peer-to-peer lending <br/> - REITs <br/> - CDs from a local, insured credit union <br/> - Individual stocks from the top socially responsible companies in the S&amp;P 500 <br/>  </p><p> A few commenters pointed out that his wife may be better off investing in the total market, maximizing returns, minimizing expenses, and then donating a portion of their earnings to charity.</p><h3> Investing is Personal</h3><p> <br/> Ultimately, the choice to practice socially responsible investing is personal. Investors should assess their own comfort levels and attempt to make the most informed choices possible.</p><p> As Jason succinctly puts it, &ldquo;No amount of money is worth being uncomfortable, in my opinion. If you can&rsquo;t sleep at night, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Readers: Do you think socially responsible investing is possible? </strong></p>",

    "link": "is-leaving-a-legacy-a-lost-art-these-days",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I was asked the other day if I thought I had left a legacy at my last job or frankly in a broader context, throughout my entire career. My quick answer was yes, no and maybe. Legacy is one of those funny words that has morphed over time. According to Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary, it is anything handed down from the past, as from an ancestor or predecessor.  Today, we tend to think of a legacy as the way in which we impacted those around us and the ways we inspired others.</p><p> I do believe that I did some things that had a positive impact on the businesses I supported from an HR perspective and with certain people that I frequently interacted with. Is that a legacy? No, not really if I was completely honest.  That doesn&rsquo;t diminish what I brought to the table every day or the things that my team and I accomplished but I question if I changed lives or perhaps inspired lots of people at some point during my career.</p><p> My views on leaving a legacy changed the day my husband died.  I had always believed that he was an amazing person who was thought highly of by those who came in to contact with him, but I truly had no clue at the magnitude of the impact he had on people.  From the moment the news started to get out about his passing, I was inundated with calls, texts and emails from people around the country who were friends, colleagues or clients of Sandy&rsquo;s.  The comments were similar and centered around the kind of person he was and the way that he changed people&rsquo;s lives. He was admired, respected and loved by such a diverse group of people, including some of this country&rsquo;s top executives, sports figures and politicians, but also the people who interacted with him on a daily basis whether at work, at our neighborhood dry cleaners, our favorite restaurant, the hair salon, gym or the local Peet&rsquo;s coffee shop.</p><p> What I learned during those hectic first few weeks was that <strong>  my husband touched so many people in a positive way. </strong> He didn&rsquo;t save lives, defend the innocent or make a million dollars a year. <strong>  What he did do was to be the voice of reason and the peacemaker who others looked up to. </strong> He was a source of inspiration to others. He made others look good every day, both literally and figuratively. <strong>  And most importantly, he was a friend to countless number of people.  Now that&rsquo;s how you leave a legacy. </strong></p><p> In today&rsquo;s cutthroat business environment, my husband was an outlier. He wasn&rsquo;t outwardly aggressive and competitive. He had an inner drive that I, and others close to him, knew about and admired but he didn&rsquo;t throw it in people&rsquo;s faces.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s something we can all learn from, that the loudest person in the room isn&rsquo;t always the most important one. Sometimes silence truly is golden.</p><p> As I go forward in my life as an author, speaker, daughter, sister and friend, I can only hope to leave a legacy as powerful as my husbands. Steady, calm and humble trumps frantic, crazy and egotistical any day.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A lot has been said already about what actually makes people successful. Many say it&rsquo;s because of their connections, resources, background, and even luck. While it is true that most, if not all, of these factors can really influence how a person may succeed in life, there is still another very important thing that contributes to an individual&rsquo;s success &ndash; self belief. Without it, there is nothing you can achieve.</p><p> <strong>  If you don&rsquo;t believe in yourself, who do you think will? </strong></p><p> If you are having doubts about your ability to succeed, how can you convince others that you will? Business people, for instance, who need to find investors for their businesses will find it hard to convince other people that their business is worth investing to if they don&rsquo;t believe it either. Before anything else, you need to believe that your concept is good and that it will succeed, or else, nobody else will.</p><p> <strong>  Self belief gives you self confidence. </strong></p><p> People who lack confidence in themselves often end up a failure. You have to understand that whatever your goals are, achieving them will always require you to face barriers and challenges first. The only way you will be able to get though them is by having the self confidence that you can overcome them. And for you to be confident, you need to believe first and have a mindset that you can do everything you want and need to do.</p><p> <strong>  Believing in yourself is that one step that will bring you closer to winning. </strong></p><p> We all have our goals in life, and most of us know what we should do to achieve those goals.

If you believe in your abilities and skills, you will be confident that you can succeed in reaching your goals. Aside from this, self belief allows you to see failure as part of the learning process and is an essential part of your success. Many people are too scared to fail, so when they do, they break down and lose motivation. On the other hand, people who believe in themselves know that they can overcome whatever difficulties and barriers come their way.</p><p> By constantly feeding your brain with optimism, good thoughts and self belief, you are definitely setting yourself up for success, be it in your personal life or <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your career planning  </a> </u> .</p>",

According to respondents, providing a top customer experience using digital channels is the &ldquo;single best opportunity&rdquo; to deliver on these priorities for 2015. The majority - 45% - said that this will lead to a personalised and relevant client experience.</p><p> <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/FSI_Personalised_experience_econsultancy_digital.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Making a personalised experience for clients is the priority for financial services, a survey from Econsultancy found\" src=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/FSI_Personalised_experience_econsultancy_digital.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> (Source: \"Digital Transformation in Financial Services: Challenges and Opportunities\", Econsultancy) </p><p> Content has an important part to play in creating this customer experience. Clients need to be reassured that financial companies are acting in their best interests. High-quality informative content is, by its nature, value-driven. It places the interests and the needs of the client first by empowering them, rather than simply talking about how great you are.</p><p> This will take different forms. For financial advisers, it could be a detailed explanation of how to invest, providing a rationale so they can understand the decisions you&rsquo;re going to make with their investments. For fintech providers, it could be a monthly round up of the latest research that will impact investor strategies.</p><p> Whichever form it takes, quality content can create a personalised, relevant and valuable client experience. So, here are three actions that financial companies can take to benefit from the digital transformation, with examples of best practice.</p><h3> 1. Feel the pain and solve problems</h3><p> It&rsquo;s inevitable that your clients will have questions, particularly with something as sensitive as personal or institutional finances. In order to offer a personal and relevant client experience, it has to respond to any concerns and reservations they may have.</p><p> Listening and responding to leads and clients is the key here, and there might be lots of ways that you can get this information. It could be from informal conversations you have, e-mail exchanges or from tracking social media.</p><p> For example, IRESS collected frequent questions they were asked about their platform on their national roadshow. They took these and created a video as a response. It was used as a sales tool, as a piece for their existing customers and for those that were unable to attend the events.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-19-at-4.11.47-AM.png\" width=\"852\"/> <br/> click to play</p><p> It&rsquo;s also another communication channel to reach leads and clients to compliment traditional methods such as phone calls, meetings, events and e-mails. One conclusion from the Econsultancy report was that companies needed to use more agile ways of working. This video is a good example of this agility in action.</p><h3> 2. Follow the customer journey</h3><p> Clients look for different things at different stages of their journey. Before you start putting together any marketing strategy, find out how they buy your services. What&rsquo;s the thought process?</p><p> For bigger financial companies, this is one of the challenges of the digital transformation. The report says that companies recognise that they need to get a better insight into their customers and behaviours across channels and devices. Legacy systems and siloed data were cited as the biggest barriers to this understanding.</p><p> For smaller, more flexible organisations, this represents an opportunity to take on the bigger financial institutions. With a greater understanding of where new clients are coming from and how they decide on their financial provider - whether that&rsquo;s as an accountant, financial adviser or fintech company - you can respond by giving them the information they need at the moments that they need it.</p><p> <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/pete-matthew-meaningful-money.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"An example of a podcast from Meaningful Money TV\" src=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/pete-matthew-meaningful-money.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Pete Matthew, the mastermind behind  <u>  <a href=\"http://meaningfulmoney.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MeaningfulMoney.tv  </a> </u> , is a financial planner based in Cornwall. He recognised that there was a shortage of information about personal finance and so started posting regular video blogs and podcasts. Each session offers hints and tips about finance basics such as budgeting, pensions and tax year-end planning. Within 18 months, online enquiries from MeaningfulMoney overtook client referrals as the number one source of new clients for his firm, Jacksons Wealth.</p><p> One reason for Pete&rsquo;s success is that he realised people went online to learn about how they could better manage their money. By giving people practical advice, he earned the trust that led to them becoming clients of Jackson Wealth.</p><p> This content doesn&rsquo;t stop being useful here either. Once they become clients, they&rsquo;re still going to access the content to learn more, leading to an enhanced customer service that few financial institutions can compete with.</p><p> A clear understanding of how a lead makes a purchase decision through digital channels (along with a personal touch in the content, which always helps) has lead to strong returns for Pete and his financial firm.</p><h3> 3. Good information leads to good decisions</h3><p> Following on from this point, it's not just about having the content, it's also about the quality. A report from Accenture about  <u>  digital intelligence in financial services </u>  suggests that those institutions that offer timely, relevant and personalised online experiences have been shown to boost sales, reduce costs and increase trust and loyalty. Content has an important role to play in this process.</p><p> It&rsquo;s true that producing content can be difficult and time-consuming, particularly when there&rsquo;s a business to run. Content creators have to find efficient ways of working in order to provide valuable updates when time is short. The answer is curation.</p><p> <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/the-reformed-broker-banner.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"The Reformed Broker - Banner\" src=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/the-reformed-broker-banner.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Smart bloggers and thought leaders recognise this. On his blog  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fthereformedbroker.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuosxvAclwsgVzijG91m2jj-1gKg\" target=\"_blank\">   The Reformed Broker  </a> </u> , US Financial Advisor Joshua Brown regularly posts  <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2015/06/17/hot-links-wheres-the-contagion/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Hot Links  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  based on what he&rsquo;s reading that day. It&rsquo;s a useful list of articles covering the global stock markets, which is a good resource for any investor staying informed about current affairs.</p><p> Another good example is  <u>  <a href=\"http://abnormalreturns.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Abnormal Returns  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s a simple formula where blogger Tadas Viskanta selects news, analysis, podcasts and market research and groups them by topic into regular posts.  <u>  <a href=\"http://abnormalreturns.com/2015/06/15/research-links-profitability-perspective/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Here&rsquo;s a June edition  </a> </u>  with research links on the profitability perspective. It&rsquo;s well-respected, with Tadas&rsquo; peers  <u>  <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/fear-loathing-in-the-financial-media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   hailing him  </a> </u>  as &ldquo;hands down the best curator out there when it comes to&hellip; the most relevant financial blogs posts of the day&rdquo;.</p><p> It&rsquo;s worth noting that these are balanced with original content. This is curation after all, not duplication. That path only leads to annoyed readers and penalties from search engines.</p><p> But content curation can be extremely effective at giving your clients the information they want and need. Create a resource full of content that reinforces the values of your organisation. Use tools such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://feedly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Feedly  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://nuzzel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nuzzel  </a> </u>  to discover new content. These incremental steps will contribute to a positive client experience and form a bedrock of trust. Empower your clients, and they will thank you for it.</p><p> Read more about the  <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/reports/digital-transformation-in-the-financial-services-sector\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Digital Transformation in the Financial Services Sector  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  report.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I have noticed that a lot of people are talking about the increased availability of financial technical resources, robo-advisors and generalizations about Millennials and their preference for using of this information to manage their own money. With all this technology and information at your fingertips, do you need a financial advisor anymore?</p><p> I, myself, used to manage my own money. I considered myself a smart person. I was educated in financial theory, financial history and even worked as a research analyst for an investment bank. When I first left financial services, I continued to make my own trades. I had some big wins, but I also had some big losses. In addition to the standard comparison to indices to measure my performance, I did some analysis to try to understand what I did right, but more importantly, I took an honest look at what I did wrong. I realized that despite all of my training and analysis of data (I even started using technical charting to improve the timing of trades,) I still fell victim to behavioral biases.</p><p> To help counteract that, I started developing a checklist to consider before I made a trade (this was before I really knew what behavioral biases meant.) However, I still found myself making not-so-good trades. I would hang onto losers because I couldnt bear to admit a loss. Or, I might sell too soon because I was panicked by some piece of news or big market reaction.</p><p> I tried using technology to help to trigger buys and sells. I tried using options to help manage risk; yet still, I would sometimes ignore the rules because I thought there was a signal that meant this one wouldnt follow the rules. And then I got busy with life and decided to get some professional help&hellip;with my finances, I mean. I am still actively involved in the decisions, but I rely on an advisor to help guide and check me.</p><p> <strong>  So how do you know if you would benefit from an advisor to help you check your behavioral biases? </strong> Ask yourself:</p><li> Have you done an honest analysis of your portfolio management decisions and results?</li><li> Do you tend to be heavily influenced by people or the media that cause you to buy assets at the top of their bubble?</li><li> Do you tend to sell assets at the bottom?</li><li> Do you understand your real risk tolerance? Do you know how to build a portfolio that matches that risk tolerance? How hard is it for you to accept losses?</li><li> Do you understand and have access to all of the investment options available to you? Do you really have time to do all that research on your own?</li>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  All Hell&rsquo;s Angels members wear black leather biker jackets, right? That&rsquo;s what I thought when I accompanied my fellow FBI agents into a grubby bar where an old Don Williams song was playing. </strong></p><p> I had been shown a photo of the Hell&rsquo;s Angel guy we were looking for&mdash;he was described as tall, shaved head, with a single silver hoop in his left ear. </p><p> My fellow agents and I were wearing suits and carrying concealed weapons&mdash;we stuck out like a sore thumb in the biker bar. Only a few continued their conversations as the bartender greeted us&mdash;the rest were waiting for our response.</p><p> Suddenly, a guy in a black leather jacket got up and started walking out the door. His head was shaved, but he was a little shorter than the man we were looking for. Still, he looked like a Hell&rsquo;s Angel and I stepped in front of him, raising a questioning eyebrow at the case agent.</p><p> The case agent shook his head so I stepped out of the way. The guy in the leather jacket smirked and headed out the door.</p><p> The Hell&rsquo;s Angel we were actually looking for was sitting at the bar in a white t-shirt, khaki shorts, with the single silver loop in his left ear. The case agent had seen him the moment he walked in.</p><p> I had a stereotyped idea of what a Hell&rsquo;s Angel guy should look like. Stereotypes can become a burden&mdash;or in my case, an embarrassment.</p><p> The truth of the matter is that we all stereotype and generalize&mdash;we have to! Generalizations make our lives easier to manage because they help us manage the constant information that bombards our brain. Generalizations are conclusions we make about people and situations that come so fast that we don&rsquo;t have to spend time thinking about them. </p><p> But negative stereotypes that are dangerous and inaccurate are alive and well, so how can facing them down make us mentally strong enough to overcome them?</p><p> Here are 3 ways you can use mental toughness to face down negative thoughts, bias, and stereotypes:</p><h3> 1. Recognize Your Brain Has A Built-In Confirmation Bias</h3><p> <br/> That means your brain stores information that is consistent with your own beliefs, values, and self-image. This selective memory system helps keep the brain from getting overloaded with too much information. </p><p> <u>  Research </u>  suggests that while we like to think that our beliefs are rational, logical, and objective, the truth is that our beliefs are usually based on the information that confirms our ideas while we ignore other information that challenges them. </p><p> Generalizations are unstable because they change over time. As more information becomes available, make it a habit of educating yourself on what is new and different. Too often, we create a rule of thumb at one point in life and never take the time to re-evaluate its credibility. Times change&mdash;and so do you.</p><li> Which generalizations have helped you make smarter choices?</li><li> How important are hunches in setting rules of thumb?</li><li> How do you probe further into issues to make your generalizations?</li><li> Are these rules of thumb can you rely upon in the future? <br/>  </li><p> If we&rsquo;re aware which generalizations influence our choices and responses, we can identify the ones that help us to react with resilience and accuracy.</p><h3> 2. Understand How Stereotypes Can Affect Your Performance</h3><p> <br/> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Steele\" target=\"_blank\">   stereotype threat  </a> </u>  occurs when a negative stereotype about your situation or your abilities weakens your confidence in yourself and  <u>  interferes with your effort to move toward success </u> . </p><p> If we know that we&rsquo;re not expected to perform as well as others, this increases our stress levels and hampers performance.</p><p> For example, in the U.S. women are very scarce in math-centric fields. Girls are told from an early age that they do not have an aptitude for Science, Technology, Engineering, or Math (STEM) so they opt for other professions. </p><p> This is a stereotype threat that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy since most women opt out of STEM careers because of the bias and isolation.</p><p> On the other hand, in a research study that presented a positive racial stereotype concerning their superior quantitative skills, Asian American women performed better than men or non-Asians on math tests. In this case, the stereotype boosted their confidence and behavior. </p><h3> 3. Acknowledge Your Barriers And Burdens</h3><p> <br/> When you face down a negative stereotype about yourself, your situation, or others on your team, you are developing the mental toughness to acknowledge your burdens and barriers. </p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409487\" target=\"_blank\">   2012 study  </a> </u>  indicates that when we have to stretch our minds to come up with less predictable and mundane solutions, we stimulate creativity and mental flexibility. When we are mentally strong, we are able to acknowledge the burdens and barriers in our life without giving up hope of our future success. When we do, several things happen:</p><li> Develop effective strategies to deal/cope with negative stereotypes</li><li> Encourage flexible thinking and improve cognitive performance</li><li> Change the way women see their careers</li><li> Stimulate creativity</li><li> Cultivate a flexible mindset capable of counteracting a stereotype threat</li><p> Women in STEM careers who challenge the stereotypes they encounter in their field actually develop the same cognitive skills that are so highly valued!</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409487\" target=\"_blank\">   Research  </a> </u>  shows that the mental effort of imagining someone behaving in non-stereotypical ways can actually make the mind stronger and more resilient. Just as the body eventually adapts to increased physical demands so that muscles become stronger, the mind adjusts to the burden of deflecting stereotypes.</p><p> Mental toughness is learning how to control our mind, rather than letting our mind control us. Awareness of how positive and negative generalizations affect our behavior is essential for our success. </p><p> How have you faced down negative and dangerous stereotypes? </p> ",

    "content": "<p> In line with June being  <u>  National Annuity Awareness Month </u> , I&rsquo;d like to also remind readers that fixed-index annuities, FIA, celebrated their 20th birthday this year. </p><p> As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/retirement/mentors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MarketWatch RetireMentors contributor  </a> </u>  and annuity expert, Stan Haithcock, reports &ldquo;in 1995, Keyport, which is now Sun Life, introduced the first fixed index annuity.&rdquo; Stan reminds us of the tainted history of the product by also stated that that day was also, &ldquo;probably the genesis for the  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.annuity123.com/how-long-have-annuities-been-around/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &lsquo;bad chicken&rsquo; dinner seminar  </a> </u>  as well!&rdquo;</p><p> Reno Frazzitta, founder and president of Secure My Funds, a Michigan based financial and retirement planning services firm, reminds us that, \"When the FIA came to market in 1995, the product was an alternative to a mutual fund and geared toward the audience a few years away from retirement.\"</p><p> Reno finds that the interest in the product from his clients continues to grow, 20 years later, \"With the aftermath of 2008 still living at the forefront of the millennial's mind, safety and security with their finances have become more important. It's also been suggested women between the ages of 35 to 45 are making an FIA a stronger part of their portfolio. This age group used to depend on the spouse's retirement options and unfortunately this just isn't an option anymore.\"</p><p> The same benefits that led to the \"bad chicken\" dinners seem to still draw interest from investors today.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.limra.com/Posts/PR/News_Releases/Total_U_S__Annuity_Sales_Improve_Three_Percent_in_2014.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   According to LIMRA, the FIA had an all-time high in 2014  </a> </u> . It held more than 50% market share of fixed annuity sales, which reportedly were up 21.3% just from the previous year.</p><p> When the FIA was introduced, advisers and insurance agents rushed to sell a \"Vanguard-like equity index\" product with insurance against downside risk. It sounded too good to be true and the money poured in. The appeal and often aggressive sales practices around the product led to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/equity-indexed-annuities_a-complex-choice\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   alerts from Finra  </a> </u>  stressing that investors should read the \"fine print,&rdquo; and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_annuity\" target=\"_blank\">   regulations  </a> </u>  (since overturned) that attempted to regulate them as securities (the index is based on equities after all) requiring sales only by registered representatives.</p><p> However, advisers such as Reno recognize that the product should only be positioned with appropriate clients and the benefits for these clients can be realized in their retirement income. Reno points out his own recent experience with a client, \"I just had a client who accumulated great wealth in the market through her earning years, but in the last decade took a 40% loss. She was close to retirement and didn't want to take the chance on this happening again. By adding an FIA, it provided a safe floor so she couldn't go backward, and provided enough liquidity for living expenses. She's now withdrawing 5.5% of that money every year to live and without worrying about losing it.\"</p><p> Reno does recommend that investors do read the fine print and he'll review these details with each of his clients, and he goes on to note that, \"As with making any kind of commitment to a product, it's important to know all the facts. It's important to do the research, there are fees associated and additional riders that come at a cost. With that being said, the costs are very comparable to the cost of a mutual fund. And at the end of the day, a person won't capture the full market gain, but there will be a guaranteed safety net in place. There's always a trade-off to every investment. Working with an expert is the first rule of thumb to determine what will be the best strategy to achieve future goals.\"</p><p> Reno also informed me that his clients prefer his advice to \"bad chicken\" any day.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A  <u>  brand </u>  experience can capture a customer&rsquo;s imagination, engage their emotions, and deliver on their expectations. A good piece of  <u>  content marketing </u>  should do the same. I&rsquo;m not going to talk about what you can learn from a company that does zero  <u>  content </u>  marketing.</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Apple  </a> </u>  fan or have sworn you&rsquo;ll never own an iPod, you can&rsquo;t deny the beauty of the Apple brand experience. From packaging to web site, from in store to advertisements, the company creates a seamless experience that delivers on every level.</p><p> So what can a content marketer learn from a company that does zero content marketing and was named the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.collectivecontent.co.uk/2013/09/09/which-companies-dont-need-to-use-content-marketing-apple-and/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   worst content marketer in the world  </a> </u> ?&rdquo; The Apple brand has a story, and while it may not be playing out in content marketing, it lives in their store every day.</p><p> In an article on Business Insider, the per store cost of an Apple Store back in 2013 estimated to be between  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/guess-how-much-each-apple-store-costs-2011-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   $8.5 and $10 million  </a> </u> . And while that number includes the creation of a  <u>  stone tile floor </u>  that demands stones quarried from a special reserved area, the true value of an Apple Store is in the staff which is the way it should be.</p><p> Putting your employees first is the key to a brand success.  Think of them as guides along your customers journey.</p><p> In fact, most of the bullets on Guy Kawasaki&rsquo;s list of  <u>  things you can learn from an Apple Store </u>  are related to the people that work there. The way the staff relates to customers, the way the brand sells, and the focus on relationships is what makes the in-store experience so special. It&rsquo;s manically consistent, it&rsquo;s completely customer focused, and it&rsquo;s all about service.</p><h3> Consistency is essential</h3><p> <br/> What can you learn from that approach about content marketing? Tons.</p><p> First, consistency and quality matter. Producing consistently excellent content in one medium on a regular basis is a better idea than trying to create something for every channel. Second, your focus needs to be on your audience, and how they perceive your offering. One of the items in the Apple steps of service is &ldquo;presenting a solution the customer can take home today.&rdquo; Your content should present a solution for your audience. It should solve their problem, overcome their boredom, or answer their question. Finally, focus on consistency. Every piece of content should have a purpose, every piece should tie back to your overall brand narrative, and every piece should offer value.</p><p> Apple may not create content marketing, but their consistent brand and in-store experience offers something almost anyone can learn from.</p><p> Ask yourself how your content represents the brand experience you&rsquo;d like your customers to have. You&rsquo;ll be one step closer to getting them entwined in your brand.</p>",

    "content": "<p> It would be rare to find anyone who does not feel sad or depressed after losing a sale or a job possibility to a competitor.  There are three actions you may take, beginning today to lessen the disappointment and increase future improved opportunities.</p><h3> Review and Revise</h3><p> <br/> Occasionally, requests for a debriefing will be granted and insight gained as to what your competitor offered that you did not.  It might be something you could not offer, you thought about but hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to incorporating into your plan, or the idea is in the planning stage for the future.</p><p> This writing was motivated by today&rsquo;s business article entitled, &ldquo;Why the Olympics Washington didn&rsquo;t win could still transform the city&rdquo; as found in The Washington Post.    The article continued that politicians are aligning to discuss ways in which the surrounding cities may partner to make the area easier to navigate, plus become visitor friendly and conducive to business without leaving white elephants after large events that take place, such as the Olympics.</p><p> A long term vision and comprehensive plan are now being worked on to benefit residents, visitors and potential Olympic teams so that in the future the event will happen and many will benefit from the experience.  The initial loss spurred the thought forward and it will supersede what was previously possible.</p><h3> Mindset</h3><p> <br/> Long ago, I put the idea of positive thought to the test.  I found that positive focus is almost equal to taking a &ldquo;clarity pill&rdquo;.  You review everything that transpired up to the current point, and become keenly aware of any possible misinterpretation, or not being 100% on target with what was communicated to you.  Mental acuity becomes sharper than ever, allowing for great attention to detail, to the point that clients take notice.  The more focused you are on all aspects of your business and clients, the greater will be the seen results.</p><h3> Pipeline</h3><p>   <br/> Last week, someone noted that keeping a pipeline full was &ldquo;old school&rdquo;.  The focus, it was said, should instead be on closing sales.  My reply was that the process should be looked at as a 360-degree perspective.  Should the pipeline not be full, a businessperson or job seeker would soon run out of options.  By maintaining a continual list of new ideas and experimenting, for entrepreneurship, the next best job, or the best prospective client, those best-matched will line up.</p><p> Using this 3-step model will lead you to an improved playing field and enjoying the  <a href=\"http://www.smoothsale.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Smooth Sale  </u>  ! </a></p>",

    "content": "<p> IT managers, Lori and Ann, were both shocked when they were given their latest projects. What this new client wanted was really complicated, and their teams were already about to tip over, not to mention the ridiculous time frame the sales team had committed to. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they ask us before making these impossible commitments?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they smoking? We can&rsquo;t possibly do this!&rdquo; ​ They both knew better than to say what was on their minds. ​​</p><p> But now the tough part. Telling their teams.</p><p> Feeling the urgency, Lori immediately called her team together for a quick huddle. Her team knew there was trouble by the look on her face, before she even said a word. And then she looked at them sincerely, &ldquo;Guys, I&rsquo;m so sorry. We&rsquo;ve been given an impossible deadline, and I know you&rsquo;re already working so hard. We&rsquo;re just going to have to do the best we can. Here are the parameters&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Ann took her cell phone to the parking lot and vented to her husband. Then she took a walk and cleared her head. She had to figure out a way to do this without crushing the team. Back at her desk, she sent out a quick calendar invite for 8 a.m. the next morning labeled &ldquo;Launch Project Flying Colors&rdquo;&ndash;no other details.</p><p> Intrigued, her team got there a bit earlier than usual to find the conference room filled with colorful helium balloons and streamers, along with blank white easel sheets plastering the walls. She had a medley of upbeat &ldquo;color&rdquo; themed songs playing on her iPhone.</p><p> &ldquo;Guys, we&rsquo;ve been given an exciting challenge and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re going to pass it with flying colors. It&rsquo;s going to be hard, perhaps the most difficult thing we&rsquo;ve accomplished, which is why I&rsquo;ve brought us here to get really creative on the best path forward. Let me outline the parameters we have to work with, and then we&rsquo;re going to work together to make a game plan.&rdquo;</p><h3> How to Galvanize Your Team to Achieve the Impossible</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I&rsquo;m fully aware that hard work is still hard work. But I&rsquo;ve seen a little bit of galvanizing magic go a long way in sparking creativity and getting folks into a &ldquo;Yes, we can!&rdquo; mindset.</p><p> <strong>  To galvanize your team toward achieving the possible&hellip; </strong></p><p> <strong>  Make winning feel like a sport. </strong></p><p> In sports, nothings more fun than winning when the odds are stacked against you. A game of lay-ups would be a real yawner. Tap into the sporting side of human nature.</p><p> <strong>  Be clear why every role matters. </strong></p><p> Watch any Little League game and at some point there will be a kid in the outfield with his finger up his nose.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Armed with just a woman&rsquo;s seminar, Morgan secured over 40 guest speaking engagements with women&rsquo;s organizations in Manhattan. Here she had the opportunity to share her message, story and brand to over 1000 women in only a two-year time frame. </strong>  The process cost her zero dollars and the time required was minimal, all it took was a few hours a week on Google (easily done while watching TV). It was that easy and totally do-able even for those of us a bit technology challenged.</p><p> As a new advisor at Morgan Stanley, Morgan had defined goals to achieve. You would think her success would start with thousands of hours on the phone cold calling to oblivion, a skill that was not in Morgan&rsquo;s repertoire nor did she want to go down that traditional path. <strong>   By focusing on the women's market, she knew cold calling was not the best way to initiate relationships as most women did not feel comfortable talking with a strange voice over the phone. </strong></p><p> Understanding what women want, combined with her interest in speaking and hosting events, inspired Morgan to call her sorority alumni asking if they needed a speaker at an upcoming chapter event; to her surprise she was quickly added to their event calendar as a guest speaker. </p><p> <strong>  After her first event, Morgan was surprised how easy it was. Her message was well received and every woman in the room now understood that Morgan was a financial advisor committed to working with women. </strong>  This immediately got Morgan thinking&hellip; &ldquo;How can I expand this process?&rdquo; Her first thought was to call other sorority alumni chapters in the area then she thought, why limit it to sorority chapters,  <strong>  why not all women&rsquo;s groups? </strong></p><p> Morgan began Googling women&rsquo;s organizations in the Manhattan area. Most all of these organizations had a website as well as a contact person. Morgan would simply send an email to the contact person offering her services as a speaker for an upcoming meeting. In the email Morgan would share the title of the presentation and a bit about her role as a financial advisor. The responses started to hit her in-box.  <strong>  While her process was not yet honed to her liking she realized early on that this was going to be her primary source of marketing and lead generation. </strong></p><p> Today she has her process is down pat. Being asked back by a number of the organizations she has spoken at only validates the effectiveness of her process:</p><li> She has a pre-scripted email, which only requires a bit of cut and pasting.</li><li> Attached to this email she gives a two page PowerPoint that talks about her presentation along with a professional bio of herself.</li><li> No longer does she offer multiple topics for them to choose from, but makes it simple presenting her most popular topic.</li><li> In her presentation she lists out some of the organizations that invited her as a guest speaker.</li><li> Also upon Morgan&rsquo;s suggestion some of the groups have started charging for the event because it will draw in an even more qualified audience. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  And this was just the beginning. </strong></p>",

    "link": "five-things-to-know-before-exercising-your-stock-options",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The stock market rise has put stock options front and center. Just like in previous booms, companies are trying to attract talented workers by granting them an option to buy company stock at a low price, which workers can sell for a much higher price if the company goes public or gets acquired by a bigger company.</p><p> Unfortunately, many employees still lack a strategy for exercising their stock options, which could prove to be disastrous when tax time rolls around.</p><p> For many recipients of stock options, a &ldquo;lottery mentality&rdquo; still holds sway when choosing how to exercise and sell stock options &mdash; they cross their fingers and hope the stock price increases so they can use the windfall for a big vacation or major update to the humble abode.</p><p> Others wait and wait, until their options are expiring and they are forced to sell before they lose all their value. Part of this mentality was born during the dot-com bubble era of the late 1990s, when stock options were  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/31/opinion/stock-option-excesses.html\" target=\"_blank\">   seen as retirement golden tickets  </a> </u>  because of their meteoric rise in value.</p><p> Sadly, many of these hoped-for riches evaporated when the tech bubble popped, and employees who had been granted potentially lucrative options to cash in company stock were left with worthless paper because they had held on for too long.</p><p> Having a process-driven strategy is vital when evaluating your stock options, so that you can make the smartest possible financial decisions. Here are five important questions to ask before exercising and selling your stock options.</p><h3> When do they vest?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s important to understand when you will actually acquire the shares. Just because options are granted does not mean you have received an immediate bonus. A typical vesting schedule is over four years, with one-quarter of shares vesting after each year. Once the shares are vested, you can exercise and sell to take that long-awaited trip to Hawaii.</p><h3> What is Uncle Sam&rsquo;s cut?</h3><p> <br/> If you are earning a high income, exercising and selling your options in the same year virtually assures the stock is taxed at an elevated rate (25% federal up to 39.6% plus your state tax). But if your income is variable and there&rsquo;s potential for lower income going forward, this could sway you to wait and sell, when you could be taxed less. If your options are expiring soon, you will not have as much of a choice, but you still may be able to spread it over several years to stay in a lower tax bracket.</p><p> Consider how long you plan to hold the stock after exercising. If you can hold longer than a year, the stock may qualify for capital gain taxes, which is likely lower than ordinary tax rates. However,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/the-odds-of-success-for-individual-stocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this decision involves risk  </a> </u> . If the stock price falls after you exercise, even though your stock options may then be worthless,  <u>  <a href=\"https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Investments-and-Taxes/Incentive-Stock-Options/INF12049.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you could still be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax  </a> </u> .</p><p> This is where knowing if you hold Incentive Stock Options (ISO) or Nonqualified Stock Options (NQSO) is essential. Any gains on ISOs that occurs after you exercise, if held for a year, are taxed at capital gain rates. Be aware, there may be a difference in the grant price and the fair market value when exercising. This is known as a bargain element and is used in the AMT calculation.</p><h3> How big is too big?</h3><p> <br/> When stock prices start to increase, options can quickly become the largest holding in a portfolio. Because of the grant price, options have a great deal of leverage, meaning they can be worthless for years before rising suddenly and dramatically if company shares become a hot commodity. Options that were worth nothing one day can be worth thousands of dollars the next.</p><p> Therefore, the concentration risk has to be considered so that too much of your portfolio isn&rsquo;t dependent on a fluctuating stock price. At this point, it becomes equally important to consider the valuation metrics and future growth potential of the stock. If the stock is over 10% of the overall investment portfolio, this might become one of the more important reasons to think about cutting some exposure.</p><p> Having a double-digit allocation to your company stock amplifies the potential outcome &mdash; good or bad. We saw countless examples of complete wipeouts in 2000, when many technology options lost their value overnight.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the potential?</h3><p> <br/> Because you are likely still working at the company that is granting you stock options, be aware of the bias you may have about your company&rsquo;s growth prospects. Spending some time investigating the fundamentals of your company&rsquo;s stock (or finding someone who can) will help in your decision-making.</p><p> Good questions to ask include: How quickly have sales been growing? How profitable is the company? Is the company an acquisition target? Who else is an owner of the stock or has been buying/selling the stock? What type of competition does the company have?</p><p> Adding analysis of the current valuation metrics (P/E ratio, P/S ratio, high-quality measures, risk measures) all should be part of your decision of how much you plan to sell.</p><h3> Is there more stock coming?</h3><p> <br/> Often when stock options are owned, employees will have restricted stock units as well as access to an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). If the vesting schedules are defined, you will have a good idea of the share amounts that may be coming your way.</p><p> This should help you establish target prices at which to exercise and sell a portion of your stock holdings, especially if you are making decisions in the rest of your portfolio based on the amount of company stock you hold.</p><p> By analyzing these factors before you click &ldquo;sell&rdquo; on your next set of stock options, you increase your chances of getting the most out of your options, and setting yourself up nicely for the future. You may also seek help from a  <u>  <a href=\"http://findanadvisor.napfa.org/Home.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fee-only financial planner  </a> </u>  to assist in your decision-making.</p>",

    "title": "7 Tips for Young Women in the Workplace",
    "link": "7-tips-for-young-women-in-the-workplace",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There has been a lot of interest lately centered on helping women succeed in the workplace.  Among the more high-profile endeavors: MSNBC&rsquo;s Mika Brzezinski seeks to empower women on her &ldquo;Know Your Value&rdquo; national tour, based on her book of the same name.  And Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, through her book, Lean In, and related website, encourages young girls and women to &ldquo;lean in&rdquo; to their ambitions and to speak up so their voices are heard.I applaud these efforts and others, as many of the career-limiting factors that I began speaking about more than 20 years ago are still evident today, and affecting a new generation of young women. <strong>  Consider these young women:  </strong> &bull; A newly appointed vice president who said that she had never thought about becoming a CEO until her mentor told her, &ldquo;You could be running this place in a few years.&rdquo;&bull; An unmarried college student who decided not to become a physician (her career choice for many years) because she wanted to &ldquo;have a life.&rdquo; She hoped to marry and have children, and decided that she couldn&rsquo;t have a successful family life and a career as a physician.&bull; The young woman who became all-but-invisible in her office because she rarely voiced her opinion.  On the rare occasion when she did say something, she spoke so softly that no one heard her.&bull; The (formerly) successful businesswoman who said, &ldquo;My husband does very well. I don&rsquo;t have to work.&rdquo; Yet she was bored at home and missed the challenges she had encountered at work.Though these examples touch on very different scenarios, they highlight how women can hobble themselves and restrict their careers through their own actions. Before women can take control of their lives and their careers, they have to recognize what they are doing to handicap themselves. Here are my suggestions: <strong>  1. Don&rsquo;t set limits on yourself. </strong>  Be open to opportunities. Aim high. More and more women are advancing in the workplace. You can be one of them. The vice president cited above noted that once her mentor expressed the possibility of her advancement, she began thinking that she could become the CEO of her company. <strong>  2. Don&rsquo;t limit your options based on an unknown future. </strong>  No one knows what the future will hold. There always will be obstacles, regardless of your choices. If you are smart enough to advance, you will be smart enough to find solutions. I know a number of career women, including physicians, who successfully balance having children and a career. <strong>  3. Appreciate history. </strong>  Learn about the struggles of women in the past. Had it not been for the efforts of women before you, many of the opportunities that you have today wouldn&rsquo;t exist. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been hired by the Philadelphia Bulletin in the late 1970s as that newspaper&rsquo;s first female photojournalist (my first profession) had it not been for the women of the New York Times who fought for parity in the newsroom. A Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, the late Nan Robertson, wrote about the lawsuit in her book, The Girls in the Balcony.  Oprah Winfrey said, &ldquo;I have crossed over on the backs of Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman and Fannie Lou Hamer and Madam C.J. Walker. Because of them I can now live the dream. I am the seed of the free, and I know it. I intend to bear great fruit.&rdquo; <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yGqytYxepNs/VXllyes-ZlI/AAAAAAAAAgE/Wg--O6pMT6M/s1600/oprah.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yGqytYxepNs/VXllyes-ZlI/AAAAAAAAAgE/Wg--O6pMT6M/s320/oprah.png\"/> </a> <strong>  4. Learn from others. </strong> Have role models and mentors. What have they done that you can incorporate into your career? A woman in one of my seminars had four young sons, worked full time, and still found the time to earn her MBA. To help manage family and career, she had a to-do list that included weekly family meetings to discuss the upcoming week&rsquo;s activities. <strong>  5. Support and encourage your friends and colleagues. </strong>  Madeline Albright, first woman U.S. Secretary of State, said, &ldquo;There is a special place in hell for women who don&rsquo;t help other women.&rdquo; Sometimes, telling a colleague that &ldquo;You can do it!&rdquo; will encourage her to go back to school. Helping a friend out when she needs an emergency babysitter may allow her to attend her night class. Remember, there&rsquo;s truth to the saying, &ldquo;what goes around, comes around.&rdquo; <strong>  6. Pick the father of your children wisely. </strong> Once you have children, life gets more complicated. You will want someone who is a partner in every sense, someone who supports you and your career. <strong>  7. Present yourself assertively. </strong>  Learn what you are doing, verbally and nonverbally, that could be detracting from your power. Speak up and let people know your opinions. Ask for what you want. There are numerous classes and books available that can teach you to present yourself assertively, including my free  <u>  Special Report: 5 &ldquo;Power&rdquo; Essentials Every Working Woman Needs to Know </u> , and my book,  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/073821759X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=073821759X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pachasso-20&amp;linkId=SX262DDEVQPRT6WJ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Power of Positive Confrontation  </u>  . </a> There is not one perfect career path for everyone, but you want to be in control of your career. Explore your options, and think about what you really want. Why not go for it? You may be surprised at how successful you will be!</p>",

    "title": "Top Takeaways from the Digital Marketing for Financial Services Summit 2015",
    "link": "top-takeaways-from-the-digital-marketing-for-financial-services-summit-2015",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Last week, Veriday had the opportunity to attend and sponsor the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialdigitalmarketing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Digital Marketing for Financial Services Summit  </a> </u>  in Toronto ( <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DMFSToronto?src=hash\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #DMFS2015  </a> </u> ). The conference brought together top digital marketing thought leaders in the industry, including brands, technology solutions and agencies, with the purpose of driving thought-leadership and educating marketers on the latest in the digital marketing world.</p><p> Although there were many takeaways from the sessions, here are some of the top themes that arose that marketers need to be aware of when developing their digital marketing strategy:</p><h3> 1. It&rsquo;s All About Consumer Engagement &amp; Experience</h3><p> <br/> It is not longer just about sales, but engaging consumers in the different stages of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-the-buyer-journey-and-why-advisors-should-care/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customer buyer journey  </a> </u> . Organizations in Financial Services can no longer remain competitive by simply providing a positive customer experience.   The buyer is changing and today&rsquo;s empowered customers expect meaningful connections with brands.</p><p> The idea of being pitched right away from a brand no longer exists. No longer is it advertising campaigns and sales that is keeping consumers loyal to brands. It is about creating meaningful connections that engage consumers and turn them into brand ambassadors. Enterprises have to engage with consumers in a different way and level, and build that trust. Delight your consumer with your content. Give consumers something insightful and that is valuable to them. Make your content fun and something that they might actually want to share with their network.   There is so much noise in the content marketing world that content should be all about your consumer, not your brand. Tell a good story, or solve your consumers&rsquo; challenges, and make your brand part of that narrative.</p><h3> 2.The Importance of Mobile</h3><p> <br/> We are continuously hearing that mobile is on the rise. Here are a couple statistics, from the conference, that goes to show just how much mobile usage continues to drastically grow:</p><li> There are more mobile devices than people on the planet.</li><li> 16.8m Canadians were reached online via smartphones and tablets in Q1 2015.</li><li> The average consumer is checking their mobile every 6 minutes, 150 times a day.</li><li> 75% of conversions on mobile devices happen within an hour of the initial search. <br/>  </li><p> Consumers are expecting a consistent experience no matter what device they are on.   As mobile increases in popularity, customer expectations are rising drastically with it.  This means that brands need to up their game to keep pace and keep the mobile experience seamless. To truly cater to their mobile customers and provide a flawless experience, businesses must understand the context in which their customers are using mobile and use this knowledge to improve their mobile services.</p><h3> 3. Multi-Channel Marketing Approach</h3><p> <br/> Omni-channel marketing has become somewhat of a buzzword in the digital marketing industry as of late. Simply put, this means that your business markets across as many channels as it can to reach its target market. From websites and email, to social media and print, every channel presents a unique opportunity to market.</p><p> An important point made at the conference was that businesses don&rsquo;t need to be on every marketing channel but they do need to be on the mediums that their customers are on. Perhaps the best approach to choosing is letting your customer&rsquo;s decide what mediums you are on by creating a dialogue with them. Ask your customers where they want to be reached and what medium you can most effectively get your message across to them. The most important thing is giving your customers the information they want, on whatever medium they are on, and making it simple for them to find exactly what they are looking for.</p><p> When you choose the appropriate marketing channels,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/secrets-of-content-marketing-3-strategies-for-repurposing-advisors-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   repurpose your messaging  </a> </u>  (mobile, infographics, webinars, e-books, etc.) and tell the same story through different channels.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fiswebdesign\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Full Impact Studios  </u> </a></p><p> Or, if you&rsquo;re looking for someone to help you improve your company&rsquo;s search rankings, a better version of this question might be: &ldquo; <strong>  How do I find the right SEO specialist </strong>  to help my business?&rdquo;  <a href=\"http://www.fiswebdesign.com/services/seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"seo-specialist-los-angeles\" src=\"http://www.fiswebdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/What-Is-an-SEO-Expert-640.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Unfortunately, the answer isn&rsquo;t as easy to find as it should be. That&rsquo;s because we live in a day and age where  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fiswebdesign.com/services/web-design-los-angeles/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business web design  </a> </u>  and Internet marketing can make or break your company within months. It&rsquo;s no surprise, then, that so many people are calling themselves search engine optimization consultants&hellip; even though they don&rsquo;t have the training, background, or reputation to back it up.</p><p> So,  <strong>  how do you find the SEO specialist </strong>  or expert to work with and avoid the people and companies who would like to take your money and give you very little in return?</p><p> The answer is in knowing exactly what to look for. Once you get past all the hype and marketing, here are the <strong>   five qualities that actually make a difference when it comes to choosing the right SEO specialist: </strong></p><h3> 1. Experience and Results</h3><p> <br/> Naturally, one of the easiest ways to distinguish the best  <strong>  SEO experts </strong>  in the field is to examine the results they&rsquo;ve been able to achieve for other clients and partners in the past. You don&rsquo;t just want to see minor improvements in Google positioning (or even major ones); instead, you want to see that they were able to help the company to  <strong>  identify the most important keyword markets </strong> , develop a plan to improve search positions over time, and then use those positions profitably.</p><p> In other words, you want to know that they actually did something, and that the effect went beyond a short-term boost.</p><h3> 2. A Broad Approach to Search Optimization</h3><p> <br/> While business owners and executives tend to think of  <strong>  search engine optimization </strong>  as a single activity, the reality is that it involves a number of different steps and processes, including: on-page optimization, technical adjustments, and off-site activities like link building. Without special attention being paid to each of these factors, the work your  <strong>  SEO consultant </strong>  does for you will always be incomplete (as will the results).</p><p> For that reason, you want an  <strong>  SEO expert </strong>  that takes a broad view of your strategy and incorporates all the important elements into the mix. Great SE advisors have a good sense of what Google any other search engines actually want, and how they crawl and index your site, so they can put all the right elements into place. That takes more work than just changing a few tags, for example, but the results are a lot more powerful and sustainable.</p><h3> 3. An Emphasis on Conversions</h3><p> <br/> Although many in business think of a top search engine ranking as a goal all by itself, the reality is that getting traffic through Google should be a means to an end. That&rsquo;s because  <strong>  you need to generate conversions </strong>  &ndash; that is, get visitors to actually do something on your website &ndash; before it can impact your business. For that reason, your SEO consultant should know as much, or more, about  <strong>  conversions optimization </strong>  as they do  <strong>  search engine optimization. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Maximizing conversions </strong>  means taking a different approach to keywords, landing pages, and other important SEO elements. This is an important part of your campaign not to overlook.</p><h3> 4. An Adaptable SEO Strategy</h3><p> <br/> Even someone who doesn&rsquo;t know much about the way search engine optimization actually works will probably recognize that Google and the other search engines are changing all the time. In response to these algorithm shifts, some <strong>   SEO consultants </strong>  find themselves chasing one fad after another. The best, though, simply use adaptable strategies that adjust over time.</p><p> Another important factor related to  <strong>  adaptable SEO is following Google&rsquo;s Panda, Penguin, and Hummingbird algorithm updates </strong> , which have drastically changed the way <strong>   Google evaluates and ranks websites </strong> . Google looks at matching keywords, quality, how recently content has been updated, geography, and even social signals are now being factored into search results on a one-by-one basis.</p><p> A  <strong>  true SEO expert </strong>  isn&rsquo;t going to be tied to any particular tool or tactic. Instead, they&rsquo;re going to keep studying and learning to ensure that they&rsquo;re always working from up-to-date information and  <strong>  SEO best practices. </strong></p><h3> 5. The Right Reputation for Service</h3><p> <br/> Ultimately, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if your  <strong>  SEO specialist </strong>  is effective and affordable if you find them difficult to work with, or if they don&rsquo;t incorporate your goals and requests into your campaign. To put things another way, you should understand that your vendor works for you, and should be easy to communicate with on an ongoing basis.</p><p> An unhelpful <strong>  SEO expert </strong> might have the right tools and education, but not the attitude you need to help your company grow. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to take all these factors into consideration when evaluating candidates and making a decision.</p><p> Once you know what you&rsquo;re really looking for in an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fiswebdesign.com/services/seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Expert SEO specialist  </a> </u> , choosing the right partner to help you rank well in Google becomes a lot easier. That&rsquo;s because your ultimate goal is to find someone who can devise a winning strategy, has gotten the right results in the past, and cares about the future of your business.</p><p> Why take chances with something so important? At  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fiswebdesign.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Full Impact Studios  </a> </u> , we have served as  <strong>  SEO specialists </strong>  to dozens of  <strong>  Los Angeles companies </strong>  just like yours. No matter where you&rsquo;re starting from now, we have the skills and expertise needed to help you reach one of the prime positions on Google and the other search engines&hellip; and the  <strong>  experience to help you turn those search rankings into profitable sales opportunities. </strong></p>",

How many of those worries actually came to pass? Very few. In fact, it&rsquo;s been estimated that ninety-nine percent of the things we worry about on a day-to-day basis never even happen. Most of our worries are empty balloons, so why inflate them?</p><p> Every minute of every day your mind can focus on worry, fear, pessimism and possible failure, or it can focus on opportunity, confidence, optimism and eventual success. The best part is, you get to choose. Choose wisely. Worry less, and live more.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SuccessMatters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mark Thompson  </u> </a>  </p><h3> A Lesson in Leadership From The NBA Champion Warriors</h3><p> <br/> Over the past 10 days, were treated to an epic battle. What would happen when the best  TEAM  in the NBA went up against arguably the best  PLAYER  (Cleveland Cavaliers' Le Bron James) in the NBA? For either franchise, this year&rsquo;s finals would be historic. The Warriors had a 40-year drought since their last championship and the Cavaliers have never won the title. It would be a great story for whoever emerged victorious.</p><p> Golden State wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be this good and hadn't won a championship since 1975 - when most of the player's parents were kids and bell bottom plaid pants were in style. Despite having some great players over the years, the Warriors hadn't been able to find the secret of success for a very...very long time. For the Cavs, they were hoping that the triumphant return of their hometown hero NBA superstar LeBron James would finally help them break the curse and bring a championship to the loyal fans of this hardworking Midwest city.</p><p> So would it be the superstar or the best team? Spoiler alert -- The best  TEAM  triumphed!</p><br /><p> The Golden State Warriors are the NBA Champs! Wait...what? Come again? How could that possibly have happened? The current ownership group of the Warriors - led by Peter Guber and Joe Lacob - made an incredible bet on this organization when they took over in 2010. They took over with the vision that they wanted to build not only a great team, but an organization that could achieve lasting success and bring pride to the whole Bay Area. But all NBA owners have that goal - what was the difference that has made the turnaround possible for the Warriors over the past few years? I'd argue that the difference is humility. </p><p> The Warriors' slogan \"Strength In Numbers\" truly speaks to the culture of the organization. From the owners to the last man on the bench, they know that no one can do anything worthwhile alone. This Warriors team, coach and ownership exemplify the partnership of \"Hubris and Humility\" - the combination of ambition and grace - two leadership traits that lead to long term success in business, athletics or nearly any other pursuit. Watching the post-game interviews after they won the Championship, you could see that every single champagne-soaked player on the Warriors team embodied this humility &ndash; each giving credit to all the other players, their wonderful coach and the visionary owners of the team and none touting their own individual performance. </p><p> The Cavaliers, led by LeBron James, did not have that same humility.  While LeBron will undoubtedly go down as one of the most talented players in NBA history - no one would name him among the game&rsquo;s most gracious, unselfish or humble. (Pre-game interviewers asked LeBron what gave him the confidence to believe that the Cavs would win and his deadpan answer was, \"because I'm the best player in the world!\") That lack of humility and the feeling that he has to make everything happen, always have the ball in his hands, and carry the entire team may be the one thing that keeps him from becoming one of the most successful players in terms of championships.</p><p> The Warriors team has exactly the opposite mentality, and it is precisely why they emerged victorious after a long season and hard-fought run through the playoffs! They have an incredible will to work hard and win, but are a team of outstanding role players who work together like a well-oiled machine. Each player adjusted to a different role as needed for each game and for each opposing team they faced - not only throughout the playoffs and finals, but throughout the entire year.</p><p> Cleveland, on the other hand had one superstar who overshadows everyone else. Everyone looked to LeBron to be the visionary and the playmaker on every play. People may say that Cleveland lost because of injuries to key players, that they had to rely on inexperienced players due to those injuries and that LeBron didn't have the team that he needed to win it all. But the fact is that great TEAMS step up in the face of such adversity, they make adjustments and pull together to do what they have to do TOGETHER to win. And that was the key to the Warriors success all season long. </p><p> Golden State came into the finals as the underdogs even though they had the best record in The NBA all year long! Their rookie coach, Steve Kerr, led the Warriors to 67 regular season wins - a record that blew away the previous record set by any NBA rookie coach. But having Kerr at the helm - who was a 5-time NBA champ as a player - was another visionary move by the team's owners. Having a coach who had been in the players' shoes and truly knows what it takes to win multiple championships was another key to their success. But one of Kerr's defining traits both as a player and now as a coach is his humility. He shies away from the celebrations and the cameras and interviews at the end of a game - pushing his players forward into the limelight to let them take the credit for their success.</p><p> The Warriors' star, Stephen Curry, is a magician on the court - and at 6'3\", smaller than most of the NBA's superstars. He's a \"lights out\" shooter who consistently makes ridiculous shots from any angle anywhere on the court against any opponent. An unlikely superstar, Steph won the NBA's regular season MVP award for helping to lead his team to those 67 regular season wins. But no one in the league is more humble about his success than Steph. always thanking God, his family, his coaches, teammates, the owners and the fans - he looks uncomfortable in almost every press conference when asked about his own phenomenal individual performances and always gives it up to his teammates.</p><p> And no one was more complimentary than Curry than when the Finals MVP honor was bestowed to his teammate Andre Iguodala - who, during the regular season, had been asked to step down from his starting role, but then stepped in to guard LeBron James throughout the Finals. Iguodala was asked to be a starter for the last three games of the Finals -- all of which the Warriors won in large part thanks to his tenacity. Andre himself said that he was anxious about the job of guarding James and had to step it up to a level that he didn't even know he had within him!  Iguodala's well-deserved MVP award for the Finals was a perfect ending - showcasing that unselfishness, humility, and sacrifice for the good of the entire organization lifts everyone to a higher level of success. </p><p> Congratulations to the entire Golden State Warriors organization for an amazing season and for showing all of us on and off the court the tenacity, grace and humility that it really takes to succeed as a TEAM at the highest level &ndash; and that nobody does it alone!</p>",

    "link": "culture-doesnt-trump-strategy",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In the last 40 years of the 20th century, strategy was the champion of business supremacy. As a critical success factor, strategy turned into a lucrative industry for a host of consulting firms such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   McKinsey &amp; Company  </a> </u> , and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bcg.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Boston Consulting Group  </a> </u> . Smart strategic thought became the conduit for propelling companies to decades of top tier performance.  In the new economy, culture is the poster child of corporate success. </p><h3> Culture is Today&rsquo;s Poster Child</h3><p> <br/> When one considers the power of culture at such notables as Google, Zappos, Amazon, and Twitter, there is good reason. Pundits are making the case that culture is the new means to the same end, using strategy as the foil. How many times have you read or heard that &ldquo;culture trumps strategy?&rdquo; This decree is nonsense.</p><p> The truth is that one success factor needs other success factors to be effective. For example, we know that a great strategy without great execution isn&rsquo;t worth the paper it&rsquo;s written on. Culture, strategy, leadership, branding, innovation, customer orientation and employee centricity must co-exist. Most leaders and managers know this. So why then, has strategy been singled out as the whipping boy?</p><h3> Shareholders and Customers Have Never Been So Demanding</h3><p> <br/> Might this have something to do with the increasing demands of customers and shareholders? Investors expect their companies to do more, do it better, do it faster, and do it at lower costs. This creates frantic searches by leaders and managers for any and every opportunity that might yield a new source of revenue and profit.</p><p> If these opportunities lead to a better bottom line and a corresponding stock price hike (even in the short-term), they must be good . . . or so the saying goes.</p><h3> Strategy is Constraining. Intentionally So</h3><p> <br/> Leaders who walk away from strategic confinement take their organizations in incoherent directions. We used to call this mode of operation, &ldquo;doing business by the seat of the pants.&rdquo; Like chickens running around with their heads chopped off, &ldquo;seat of the pants&rdquo; leaders either don&rsquo;t appreciate strategy&rsquo;s guidance, believe strategy is a deterrent to opportunity, or have never enjoyed the rewards of astute product or service differentiation. Without strategic clarity, the complexity virus infects the company. Left unchecked, it will stifle, stagnate, and bring the organization to its knees.</p><h3> Business Models Change. So Must Strategy</h3><p> <br/> Strategy does not curtail change because business models need not be static. Despite the decline of &ldquo;instant&rdquo; coffee, Nestle envisioned a better future because they expanded their definition of the category. They defined their business as &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; coffee and pioneered a new category within the tenets of their brand and coffee expertise. A $5 billion business known as  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso\" target=\"_blank\">   Nespresso  </a> </u>  was the result.</p><p> Similarly, in the digital world, a strategy that confines retailers to bricks and mortar is foolhardy. Although late to the game,  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/03/11/target-walmart/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Walmart and Target  </a> </u>  are making huge strides in carving out a piece of this growing digital pie. You can bet their strategies for e-retailing aren&rsquo;t wishy-washy.</p><p> Beyond determining the playing field, and telling you &ldquo;what not to do,&rdquo; strategy helps define the culture. When strategic intent is clear and concise, it provides the impetus for uncovering opportunities, enhancing know-how, and ensuring perennial stability in employment, earnings, and shareholder value.</p>",

In this post, we take a closer look at the SEC's proposed amendments to the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/275.204-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2  </a> </u>  that would require investment advisers to maintain records of the calculation of investment performance information that is distributed to any single person.</p><p> In regards to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-books-and-records\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   maintaining books and records  </a> </u>  related to the distribution of investment performance information, the Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2(a)(16) currently reads:</p><p> <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=a40307ad-518d-421a-b817-2e9062e0b235&amp;placement_guid=157f1283-a739-4f7c-ac1d-4e5cf0cf420d&amp;portal_id=305003&amp;redirect_url=APefjpHWxfLm3uNtYnVHGGnn6ysuCDwnR-Rkx2vJ-9_UAm-t0TwyNS7FrDuVl4jHfQfv6_TCaTfIsKIARTC65aS16bNxEBhCRDwCb5Fi2tIbDHDu2mAGqeszoFMvorHc6l-0IGaPVIFSLME9lWM7ivesFx9lvF8tcREV0zNHn-Gas5VsCQfGxYukXMk6aIKXt_yCgT_DOyATeMK4mU2gpUsxUwD-62Qb0RLVnuTkqNIcZ5I1gjroPh9ai3RMnRwTJh0BbTWOtxxI8DO-vmofJktcXSWpHrVTlQ&amp;hsutk=1a859e8c35c6c8efbb9dc23cdc4de418&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fsec-rias-should-be-required-to-maintain-all-performance-information&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fsec-rias-should-be-required-to-maintain-all-performance-information&amp;__hstc=69624975.1a859e8c35c6c8efbb9dc23cdc4de418.1427232496895.1432844667185.1434566943459.3&amp;__hssc=69624975.1.1434566943459&amp;__hsfp=2545656383\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Download our free RIA Technology Infographic  </u>    </a></p><p> All accounts, books, internal working papers, and any other records or documents that are necessary to form the basis for or demonstrate the calculation of the performance or rate of return of any or all managed accounts or securities recommendations in any notice, circular, advertisement, newspaper article, investment letter, bulletin or other communication that the investment adviser circulates or distributes, directly or indirectly, to 10 or more persons (other than persons connected with such investment adviser); provided, however, that, with respect to the performance of managed accounts, the retention of all account statements, if they reflect all debits, credits, and other transactions in a client's account for the period of the statement, and all worksheets necessary to demonstrate the calculation of the performance or rate of return of all managed accounts shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p> Thus, presently, RIA firms registered with the SEC are generally required to maintain performance information that is distributed to 10 or more persons. In its new proposal, the SEC is requesting the following rule changes to be made:</p><p> Rule 204-2(a)(16) currently requires advisers that are registered or required to be registered with us to maintain records supporting performance claims in communications that are distributed or circulated to ten or more persons. Although it has been our staff&rsquo;s experience that investment advisers routinely make and preserve communications containing performance information and records to support the performance claims, the books and records rule requires such records only when the communication is distributed to ten or more persons. We are proposing to amend rule 204-2(a)(16) by removing the ten or more persons condition and replacing it with &ldquo;any person.&rdquo; Accordingly, advisers would be required to maintain the materials listed in rule 204-2(a)(16) that demonstrate the calculation of the performance or rate of return in any communication that the adviser circulates or distributes, directly or indirectly, to any person. The veracity of performance information is important regardless of whether it is a personalized client communication or in an advertisement sent to ten or more persons. </p><p> In addition, the SEC is also proposing a rule change to Rule 204-2(a)(7):</p><p> Rule 204-2(a)(7) currently requires advisers that are registered or required to be registered with us to maintain certain categories of written communications received and copies of written communications sent by such advisers. We are proposing to amend rule 204-2(a)(7) to require advisers to also maintain originals of all written communications received and copies of written communications sent by an investment adviser relating to the performance or rate of return of any or all managed accounts or securities recommendations. We believe these records would be useful in examining and evaluating adviser performance claims. A recent enforcement action demonstrated to us the disadvantages of not requiring investment advisers to maintain records forming the basis of performance calculations or performance communications sent to individuals.</p><p> <strong>  The SEC's rationale behind these proposed rule changes includes: </strong></p><li> Whether performance information is distributed to one or many investors, accuracy is important.</li><li> This would not be an overly burdensome rule change as most investment advisory firms already maintain such information.</li><li> It would provide the examination staff with additional tools to enforce cases of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-performance-advertising\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fraudulent advertising  </a> </u> .</li><li> Investors would benefit as the frequency of cases related to fraudulent advertising may decline. <br/>  </li><p> The SEC does also acknowledge that this rule change could discourage RIA firms \"from creating and communicating custom performance information to individual clients, who would then lose the benefit of having that information available to them.\" However, the agency believes this is unlikely. </p><p> In addition, the SEC notes that individual advisory firm \"compliance costs also would vary depending on the degree to which performance figure determination and the record keeping process is automated...\" Thus, it's possible that this rule proposal could lead to additional advisory firms purchasing automated portfolio management and reporting technology solutions such as  <u>  Rushmore Advisor Services </u> .</p><p> If your advisory firm is debating whether to advertise investment performance, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/noaction/clovercapital102886.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   SEC staff no-action letter issued on October 28, 1986 to Clover Capital Management  </a> </u>  provides great insight into what is and is not acceptable at the federal level. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-to-choose-an-ria-compliance-consultant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA compliance consultants  </a> </u> , we recommend that investment advisory firms  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/performance-advertising-why-an-ria-firm-should-exercise-caution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   exercise extreme caution when it comes to performance advertising  </a> </u>  regardless of whether marketing to one or many investors. We also strongly encourage the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) of each RIA firm to take a few minutes to review the firm&rsquo;s current advertising procedures to ensure it is staying in compliance with all relevant  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/ria-books-and-records-requirements-correspondence-vs-advertising\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SEC or state statutes  </a> </u> .

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Those that follow my posts know I love a little tongue-in-cheek with a dash of exaggeration-for-effect. You&rsquo;re obviously not technically only as strong as your network, but throughout your entire career (or life) <strong>  no other aspect will influence your success as much as your network. </strong> This network can be personal or professional, but preferably both.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you leverage your network to find a new job, secure a new customer, locate employees, or find a doctor or lawyer or whatever. You network is extremely important.</p><p> One aspect that is difficult for many to grasp is that your network, in most cases, will trump your credentials. Friends hire friends before they hire strangers with shiny MBA&rsquo;s. Sorry. Life&rsquo;s not fair and that&rsquo;s the way it works.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s get started with key number one to building a healthy network. It&rsquo;s something I love to share with virtually everyone I meet. It&rsquo;s my favorite and fastest way to explain what you need to know. Please repeat after me:</p><h3> One: It&rsquo;s not who you know. It&rsquo;s not what you know. It&rsquo;s who knows what you know.</h3><p> <br/> Are you a real estate agent? You better let me know before I put my house up for sale? You get the gist. This aspect of communication and sharing has become so easy with the popularity of social media. Want to know what I do? You can Google me or check out my LinkedIn profile or  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/andrewlacivita\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Facebook author page </a> . It couldn&rsquo;t be easier.</p><p> Whether you decide to make people aware in-person, over the phone, or online, you simply need to make sure to do it. Let the world know what you offer. The best approach is to do it everywhere.</p><h3> Two: Quantity is important, but diversity is more critical.</h3><p> <br/> The best type of professional network isn&rsquo;t necessarily the largest one. It&rsquo;s actually the most diversified one. You can imagine how a diversified network is fantastic for supporting your career. Beyond professional reasons, a strong, diversified network is just as beneficial for day-to-day personal needs&mdash;finding a good lawyer (not an easy thing), getting a reference on a contractor, or discovering a great restaurant.</p><h3> Three: You help first and you ask for help second.</h3><p> <br/> As a recruiter, I get several hundred (not a typo) calls and emails everyday. Want to guess the number of people on the other end of the phone or keyboard who contact me for the sole purpose of offering me something? How many do you think need something from me?</p><p> I have been operating milewalk for eleven years. During that time, I have not had one single person call and ask me something such as, &ldquo;Hey Andy, I thought I&rsquo;d just check in and say &lsquo;HI.&rsquo; I was calling to see what you were working on (job search-wise) to see if I know any people that might be good fits for your opportunities.&rdquo; Of course, people in my network will help me network after I ask. Rarely, if ever, will anyone offer without needing something for him or herself.</p><p> If someone actually called me and said that, I would not only frame a picture of him or her on my office wall, but also drop everything I was doing the next time they needed something just so I could help him or her. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want that type of relationship capital in her bank? The most laughable point is that my lifetime affection and help would be granted for five minutes of her time&mdash;when she needed nothing.</p><h3> Four: You do it continually, not solely when you need it.</h3><p> <br/> There is no single formula for effective networking and relationship building. One thing is certain; it&rsquo;s something you do over time as opposed to a single event. My best suggestions would be to allocate time each month reaching out (or preferably meeting with) individuals or groups that are important and of interest to you. Ask them about others you should meet. Even if you happen to need something at that moment, that will at least provide an avenue to extend your network. Want a bigger bang for your time? Join a business or social club. Too expensive? Join a running club. Hate to run? Join a free networking group. Don&rsquo;t know any? Google &ldquo;networking group [insert your topic of interest here].&rdquo; You get the picture. Once you get the ball rolling, you can extend your network from there.</p><h3> Wonder whether your network is strong enough?</h3><p> <br/> Test it! If you had to contact someone for professional reasons, how many people would you feel at ease calling? Fewer than 50 indicate your network is too small. The number itself, however, is only one metric. The more important indicator of its health is likely its diversity. A small network of deep ties is nice, but the best constellation combines the nucleus of strong ties with a well-balanced complement of secondary relationships. This level of quantity along with greater diversity flat out gives you more options and access to the people or things you need to more easily operate your life.</p>",

    "title": "10 Ways to Improve Employee Engagement Through Your Onboarding Process",
    "link": "10-ways-to-improve-employee-engagement-through-your-onboarding-process",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Did you know that 90% of employees make their decision to stay with a company during the first six months of employment?&sup1;  Despite spending an increasing amount of money and time on recruiting efforts, many firms ignore the imperative impact new employee onboarding provides.</p><p> In today&rsquo;s economy, coupled with the diminishing workforce supply, increased competition for first-rate talent, and expectations from the next generation, an onboarding program is crucial.</p><p> During recruiting, interviewing, and hiring, candidates typically express enthusiasm, but are not yet engaged with your firm. It&rsquo;s important to facilitate opportunities where employees can participate in activities that redirect enthusiasm to high-level engagement.</p><p> The results of a well-planned onboarding program will help you ward off expensive turnover costs, increase revenue, and develop higher levels of engagement and loyalty from new employees. Incorporate these ideas  <strong>  before </strong> , <strong>  during </strong> , and  <strong>  after </strong>  you select a new employee.</p><h3> 1. Start an Onboarding Process during the Recruitment Phase</h3><p> <br/> Onboarding starts long before you hire a new team member and is more than a day or two of orientation. Candidates make a decision whether or not to apply to your firm based on how they perceive you. Incorporate a process that is attractive to potential new hires by ensuring your career site, website, and your company LinkedIn page are welcoming, inviting, and reflect your culture.</p><h3> 2. Provide a Realistic Job Preview &ndash; No Surprises</h3><p> <br/> I once was hired by a company only to find out after my start date that the job I thought I was hired to do was completely different than what I was actually doing. Misrepresenting a new position destroys trust which is extremely difficult to rebuild, if not impossible. Show candidates a realistic look at your organization and the job you are hiring them to do. Use job descriptions, videos, and a written plan detailing objectives, strategies, and expectations. Include messages from upper management with descriptive statements that tell new hires how to succeed in their new role.</p><h3> 3. Hold Multiple Interviews</h3><p> <br/> If your interview process is sloppy, candidates will be turned off in a matter of seconds and find new opportunities. Start by assessing candidates and hold at least two or three follow up interviews. Seek input from other team members by including them in the hiring decision. Peer interviews help new employees engage with other team members once they are hired.</p><h3> 4. Email Relevant Updates Prior to Start Date</h3><p> <br/> Send new hire welcome messages and company updates before their first day. This provides a jump start to employee engagement and is a win-win for both your firm and new employee. Automate as much of the orientation process as possible: share welcome videos from senior leadership, company history, mission, vision, and code of ethics statements, training tutorials, and your policy and procedures manual.</p><h3> 5. Provide Important &amp; Meaningful Experiences On Day One</h3><p> <br/> Welcome new team members on the first day by spending less time on paperwork and more time building a relationship. Let them know how their role contributes to the success of your firm which is a vital piece to the engagement puzzle. Have new employees complete a few small tasks that are important and meaningful.</p><h3> 6. Provide Career Paths</h3><p> <br/> It is essential to understand the desired career path of your team members and provide a map with defined steps, actions, and time frames to move from point A to point B. Ask new employees how they view their career path within your firm. Based on their response, along with identifying personality traits, education requirements, leadership potential, and skill set, create a career path that will empower team members to achieve success, build loyalty to your firm, and reach their full potential.</p><h3> 7. Create an Employee Directory Handbook</h3><p> <br/> Give new team members a chance to get to know others with an employee directory. Include photos, roles within the firm, and some fun facts about each team member. This is a great way to start building connections with peers.</p><h3> 8. Assign a Mentor</h3><p> <br/> A coach or mentor provides employees face-to-face time with someone that can teach them the ropes and help them adjust to the culture in your firm.  Typically, new professionals are uncertain of specific practices and may feel uncomfortable asking upper management questions pertaining to their job. A mentor will guide and bridge that gap. Be diligent when choosing a mentor; the wrong mentor can teach bad habits, while the right mentor will uphold your firms&rsquo; values. Mentoring new employees helps shape behavior, improves retention rates, and is a top driver of employee engagement.</p><h3> 9. Utilize Gamification</h3><p> <br/> Many adults agree that making every day activities more like a game are fun and rewarding. Studies also show that gamification leads to an increase in engagement metrics. You may be asking, &ldquo;What is gamification and how can I incorporate it?&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification\" target=\"_blank\">   Wikipedia  </a> </u>  defines gamification as the use of game mechanics and rewards for non-game applications in order to increase engagement and loyalty.</p><p> Use games to teach business lessons. Consider holding a scavenger hunt to help new hires learn where to find things in your office. Ask them to take pictures with their phone showing where important documents, resources, and supplies are located in their physical surroundings. Invite them to take cultural pictures that represent client service, team work, or images that validate your firms&rsquo; vision, mission, and values.</p><h3> 10. Measure Onboarding Results</h3><p> <br/> Measuring the new employee experience is a critical step in your overall process. Solicit feedback by utilizing a survey and then use the information provided to ensure your process creates a consistent loop that engages people with your firm.  Create ranking surveys using a scale from 1 to 10, or utilize open-ended questions that encourage new hire perceptions in further detail.</p><li> Was my supervisor ready and prepared for my arrival?</li><li> Did everyone on the team welcome me?</li><li> Did the recruiting process describe my job appropriately?</li><li> Was the training effective?</li><li> What materials did you find the most valuable? <br/>  </li><p> You cannot expect employees to perform their best without full integration and suitable acclamation to their new role.</p><p> As the recruiting process becomes more and more challenging, a solid onboarding program is critical.

    "content": "<p> Written by: Robert Bartenstein | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WashWealth?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwashwm.com%2Fblog%2Ffinancial-advisors-prepare-for-a-successful-transition&amp;profile_id=432725751&amp;tw_i=611213761345515520&amp;tw_p=embeddedtimeline&amp;tw_w=555386654169374720\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Washington Wealth Management  </u> </a></p><p> In the great 80&rsquo;s movie &ldquo;Trading Places&rdquo; Dan Akroyd&rsquo;s character Louis admonishes his miserly uncle who scoffs at the size of the payroll checks to be signed, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get around the old minimum wage, Mortimer.&rdquo; The same could be said of your transition from a wirehouse to independence. There&rsquo;s simply no &ldquo;easy way&rdquo; to get it done. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a charlatan or has never performed the delicate operation themselves. When it comes to making the move to independence the degree of difficulty you&rsquo;ll experience, whether more or less, is purely relative. With that said the lifetime of rewards that await more than justify the effort.</p><p> Finding the right partner will solve much of the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;where,&rdquo; the mechanics if you will. What advisors must do for themselves is prepare. Prepare your mental attitude, prepare with training, and prepare with planning. With these bulwarks in place, anyone can make the move to independence efficiently and effectively. Here&rsquo;s what I mean:</p><li> <strong>  Prepare with Mental Toughness: </strong>  When you imagine independence; with your name on the door of a great office, your own brand, your website and legions of adoring clients who&rsquo;ll follow you to the end of the earth, you&rsquo;re right. What your big box firm imagines is you machine gunned at a toll booth like Sonny Corleone, your bullet riddled body slowly rolling to a stop in the street while the henchmen drive away with your livelihood. <br/> <br/> Make no mistake, there&rsquo;s going to be a gunfight, so you need to be mentally tough, evangelical even, about your cause. Get your mind right. Before the shooting starts you have to know with certainty why you&rsquo;re doing what you&rsquo;re doing, for whom and over what time period it will be done. It will feel a lot worse than it is. Statistically the odds are very much in your favor. A recent Fidelity/Cogent study revealed that 86% of breakaway advisors said they took all or most of their clients when they made the move to independence. Our experience echoes that number. Buckle your chin strap and welcome the battle, you&rsquo;re going to win.</li><br/><li> <strong>  Prepare with Training:  </strong> Being mentally tough is a form of preparation but it alone won&rsquo;t get the job done. You need to know how things work at your future destination. A strong transition partner will set you up with an in-depth timeline and get you and your team trained on the new systems and procedures BEFORE your move. A good place to start is with a thorough understanding of The Protocol, aka The Protocol for Broker Recruiting. Understanding what you can and cannot take with you is crucial. In simple terms, you can take; client names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and account titles of the clients you served while employed by the losing firm. Most advisors prepare two copies of a &ldquo;Protocol Spreadsheet&rdquo; one for your employer to demonstrate what you are taking and one for yourself to provide a concise record of that data. <br/> <br/> Next, focus on the systems of your new broker dealer and custodian. Each company has its own way of doing things and without proper instruction you&rsquo;ll feel like you woke up in a foreign country where no one speaks your language. As you get down to the account level detail focus on margin rate and security based loan rate matching, the various streams of trail revenue you may have on things like life insurance and annuities, and lining up other services you&rsquo;ve been offering clients like RMD&rsquo;s, for example. These can be particularly tricky to get correctly mapped, don&rsquo;t be afraid to provide too much detail. Most of all, ask questions until your satisfied that the answers are consistent and accurate. Independent broker dealers and custodians don&rsquo;t necessarily use the same language and terms you&rsquo;ve grown up with, check and double check- and always beware of the half answer. Specifically, my experience dictates the following action steps are worth detailing: <br/>   <li>  Ensure all positions, money managers, alternative investment strategies and outside investment accounts can transfer to your new broker dealer or custodian. </li> <li>  Spell out each account&rsquo;s activities, RMD&rsquo;s, checking, direct deposits, etc. </li> <li>  Detail discounts on loan rates or other priced assets ahead of time, discuss in advance. </li> <li>  Design your client contact plan and content. Role play it.  <br/>    </li> <br/> Given the stress of being found out, your antipathy for the firm you&rsquo;re leaving and the late hours required to conduct all of this business in secret, you&rsquo;re quite likely to want to let the training slide, DON&rsquo;T! If there&rsquo;s one lesson our teams would universally share, it&rsquo;s that the level of training prior to the move is directly proportional to the smoothness of the transition itself. This is where teams have a distinct advantage over individuals as partners&rsquo; energy levels ebb and flow it&rsquo;s easier to stay on task, stay optimistic and hold each other accountable. Stay mentally tough, take advantage of the training and you&rsquo;ll hit the ground running.</li><br/><li> <strong>  Prepare with Planning:  </strong> This may seem redundant but we read stories all the time about transitions gone wrong and it&rsquo;s obvious that what happened was due to a lack of planning or a weak plan that failed. The first rule of transition is that you should not be in a hurry. Speed kills, as they used to say, and when teams are in a hurry, the first thing that suffers is the plan. Too often there is a temptation to try to say &ldquo;Pass&rdquo; as if you&rsquo;ll come back to that or figure it out later. Bad idea. You&rsquo;re in a gunfight, address the threats in front of you systematically and don&rsquo;t rush. There&rsquo;s a reason the military mantra of &ldquo;slow is smooth, smooth is fast&rdquo; never goes out of style. Planning the delicate mapping of all of your valuable and value-added services will prevent otherwise costly relationship stress with clients when you need it least. <br/> <br/> Last, plan your resignation and grand opening. Resignation is straightforward when handled properly. This is not the time to play Jerry Maguire or Spartacus. You can come back for everyone later, if you choose. Draft your resignation letter (one paragraph) and get on to the business of opening your new office. Proper planning will have allowed you to test and retest all aspects of your technology; phones, computers, copiers, fax lines, access cards, website, etc. Launch your press release, flip the switches and get on the phone with your best clients. <br/> <br/> In the middle of the battle, take time to smile when your clients start to ask, &ldquo;What took you so long?&rdquo; Louis was right, you can&rsquo;t get around the old minimum wage, but the wages of courage are glory. Enjoy the fight.</li>",

King  </a> </u> , the &ldquo;King of Blues&rdquo; family members are disputing his estate in court.</p><p> B.B. King&rsquo;s family filed a family court suit prior to his passing, <strong>  claiming that King was receiving inadequate care and that over one million dollars was missing from his bank accounts. </strong> Moreover, the family accused King&rsquo;s longtime manager, Laverne Toney, of this alleged elder abuse; at the time, Toney had  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/powerofattorney.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Power of Attorney  </a> </u>  for B.B. King.</p><p> Currently, the family is accusing Toney of poisoning King to death. As King&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Executrix  </a> </u> , Toney can receive fees for her work. Toney is also suspected of being a  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   beneficiary  </u>    </a> of King&rsquo;s Will.</p><p> On the other hand, B.B. King&rsquo;s family members are claiming that Laverne Toney is a &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer_rule\" target=\"_blank\">   Slayer  </a> </u> &rdquo;; a person who murders a loved one in order to inherit under the victim&rsquo;s estate.</p><p> If Toney did murder the legendary B.B. King, can she still act as Executor? Can she still inherit under his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Will  </a> </u> ?</p><p> In one of the first cases of this kind, the New York  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riggs_v._Palmer\" target=\"_blank\">   Riggs v Palmer  </a> </u>  case, a grandson murdered his grandfather and tried to keep his grandfather&rsquo;s inheritance; the court definitively decided that Slayers cannot inherit from their victim&rsquo;s estate. In New Jersey, Slayers are treated as if they predeceased the victim. In this way, an inheritance can still pass to the Slayer&rsquo;s innocent children and heirs, but not to the Slayer himself.</p><p> Though the verdict isn&rsquo;t out as to whether Toney murdered the celebrated B.B. King, it is not uncommon for family members to think a caregiver murdered their loved one. When families have strong evidence to suspect foul play, a criminal case is started so that a police investigation and coroner&rsquo;s autopsy can commence. Additionally, families retain  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estate planning  </a> </u>  attorneys to assist them with the execution of the will, or an administration of the estate if there is no will.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Change is hard. Don&rsquo;t believe anyone who tells you it&rsquo;s not. Ideas, dreams, wishes, that&rsquo;s easier. Sitting on your couch thinking big, who hasn&rsquo;t done that?</p><p> &ldquo;I should quit my job and become a location independent blogger. I&rsquo;d love to travel the world.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I always make people laugh. It would rock to perform at Second City someday.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I could write a book that&rsquo;s better than this one. In fact, I should.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need this many headaches. I&rsquo;m totally going to quit my job.&rdquo;</p><p> Whoa. Before you quit you job tomorrow, it&rsquo;s important to understand if you&rsquo;re a Wisher, Persister or a Succeeder on this particular dream. What? Haven&rsquo;t you heard those terms before? Okay, I made them up, but I use them because they&rsquo;re a great guide for getting clear on where you currently stand and how to achieve your goals.  </p><p> Wishers, Persisters and Succeeders all have opportunities to make focused changes in their approaches. It&rsquo;s all about figuring out a next step that&rsquo;s meaningful, intentional and will drive desired results.</p><p> Most people don&rsquo;t fall into one category in all areas of their life. In fact, chances are, you&rsquo;ve been all three at one time or another. For example, you may be a Wisher when it comes to writing your book, a Persister when it comes to running a marathon, and a Succeeder with starting your own business. </p><h3> How to Achieve Your Goals for Wishers, Persisters, and Succeeders</h3><p> <br/> Instead of thinking of this model as a series of landing points, consider them doors that you open with your actions. The keys are confidence, creativity, and growing competence over time. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look. </p><p> <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/how-to-achieve-your-goals.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"How to achieve your goals for wishers, persisters and succeeders\" src=\"http://breaktheframe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/how-to-achieve-your-goals-300x225.png\"/> </a></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Nobody+leaps+from+Wisher+to+Succeeder+without+a+lot+of+persistence+in+between.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/how-to-achieve-your-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nobody leaps from Wisher to Succeeder without a lot of persistence in between.  </a> </u></p><h3> WISHERS</h3><p> <br/> This is where we all start, and some of us get stuck, forever. </p><h3> What are some of the telltale signs of a Wisher?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Shifting Dreams </strong></p><p> Wishers think big, but one of the hallmarks of Wishers is that the dream is constantly morphing. At least that&rsquo;s the way it seems on the surface.</p><p> I swear one of my clients has a new business idea monthly that they are &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; going to do. From the outside, the ideas are seemingly unrelated with the only commonality that my client is 100% gung ho. </p><p> Finally, we dove into the deeper work of what he truly wants. It&rsquo;s not to start a drop ship business on eBay, shocker; it&rsquo;s to create a business and a life where he can work fewer hours and be with his family more. Aha. </p><p> <strong>  All Talk, No Action (or half-hearted at best) </strong></p><p> When it comes to talk, Wishers don&rsquo;t play small. In fact, they often have significant goals and ideas. They also talk about them all the time. </p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m going to do.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Have I told you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Yep. You&rsquo;ve told me and everyone else too. </p><p> I don&rsquo;t want to categorize all Wishers as exclusively big talkers. Some Wishers do take  action, but it&rsquo;s usually to back up their excuses instead of moving the dream forward. </p><p> &ldquo;I tried to get a new job. I put my resume on Monster, but nothing came of it.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I was going to run today, but I&rsquo;m still sore from my run a few days ago. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Let Fear Rule </strong></p><p> People who are forever wishing and taking limited action to make their dreams a reality are often secretly afraid. What if they&rsquo;re not talented enough, smart enough, connected enough? What if they&rsquo;re found out for being imposters, stepping too far too fast? </p><p> Wishers start to believe the devil on their shoulder and replace potential action with longing. The &ldquo;what if&rsquo;s&rdquo; erode confidence to the point where the dream is a great one&hellip; for someone else. </p><h3> Homework for Wishers</h3><p> <br/> 1) Uncover what you want at the core. Is it to be a blogger or to have a location independent business or to travel more. When you know what your big vision is, it becomes your guiding star for all of your ideas and actions. </p><p> 2) Stop worrying about what you&rsquo;ll do half-way to your goal. Take the first step, your next step, to turn your dream into reality. If you stand still, so does your dream. </p><p> 3) Turn your fear into energy. Start with positive self-talk. You may feel silly at first but until you believe in yourself, you&rsquo;ll never move forward with confidence.</p><h3> PERSISTERS</h3><p> <br/> No more thinking, Persisters start doing and keep on going. </p><h3> What are some of the telltale signs of a Persister?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Action is Your Middle Name </strong></p><p> Persisters are in motion, no longer wishing; they&rsquo;ve moved to creating. However, not all action is created equal. </p><p> I know a few coaches from my coach training days that wanted to be able to support themselves full time through their practice, so they started blogging, a lot. They&rsquo;ve been very busy blogging almost daily for years but still have very limited clients. They are clearly Persisters, but their challenge is they&rsquo;re not sure what else to add to their current action to move forward. They don&rsquo;t know their next step. </p><p> <strong>  Focus on the Vision </strong></p><p> Remember the vision the Wishers had for homework? Most Persisters have it down. They know what they want, and they&rsquo;re going after it. All activity centers on achieving their goal. </p><p> Persisters are also great at blocking out distraction and suffer far less from &ldquo;shiny object syndrome&rdquo; than Wishers. Smart Persisters know that they can&rsquo;t write their novel while watching TV or play Candy Crush while facilitating their team meeting. </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Persisters+prioritize+focused+action+over+busywork.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/how-to-achieve-your-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Persisters prioritize focused action over busywork.  </a> </u></p><p> Distractions are always present, but Persisters are unlikely to be easily knocked off course. </p><p> <strong>  Push Through Even When You Want to Stop </strong></p><p> Not everything you have to do to achieve a goal, even one you strongly desire, is going to be fun. In fact, not everything you do is going to be perfect. Persisters recognize that just because they went off their diet on Tuesday, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that Wednesday is shot as well. </p><p> Persisters push through pain, setbacks, and frustration because the big vision keeps pulling them forward. Difficulty doesn&rsquo;t mean giving up. </p><h3> Homework for Persisters: </h3><p> <br/> 1) Remember, variety is a Friend. If you&rsquo;re having mild to moderate success with your current techniques, change it up and challenge yourself to try something new. You never know when a small tweak to routine can yield big results. </p><p> 2) Don&rsquo;t hang in there indefinitely. I know that the commonly issued advice is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t give up!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s time to add &ldquo;too soon&rdquo; to the end of that thought. It&rsquo;s not a failure to learn from your efforts and shift your energy towards a new goal after giving it your all. </p><p> 3) Put in some hustle to multiply the impact of your effort. It&rsquo;s okay to have good days and bad days, it&rsquo;s human. Look up hustle in the dictionary and you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;a state of great activity.&rdquo; Keep turning up the volume to reach your max potential.  </p><p> The next doorway is the Succeeders. It&rsquo;s not a secret club of super lucky people who got a big break.  They worked for it, hard. Persisters understand taking a wish, putting it into action and working hard towards a goal. Nevertheless, some Persisters do give up before success but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to failure. For some, their dream has shifted, or their passion has waned. Others discover that their dream doesn&rsquo;t bring them joy and is simply one more thing on their to-do list they despise.  </p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=It%E2%80%99s+okay+to+let+go+of+one+dream+to+reach+for+another.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/how-to-achieve-your-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   It&rsquo;s okay to let go of one dream to reach for another.  </u> </a></p><p> If you stop before success, after giving it your all, it&rsquo;s not failure, it&rsquo;s a choice. </p><h3> SUCCEEDERS</h3><p> <br/> Achieving goals and celebrating accomplishments. </p><h3> What are some of the telltale signs of a Succeeder?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Risk is a Friend </strong></p><p> Succeeders don&rsquo;t shy away from risk.  They&rsquo;re also experts at discerning between unnecessary risk and smart opportunities that require significant fortitude. While others may resist stepping into the discomfort of the unknown, Succeeders thrive on the edge. </p><p> Energized and most alive when pushing themselves to the limits of their capabilities, Succeeders relish a challenge.</p><p> <strong>  Whatever it Takes &ndash; Within Reason </strong></p><p> Focused, driven, and energized, Succeeders are willing to push themselves to the limit to achieve their goals, but not beyond. They know themselves well enough to know that it&rsquo;s not only this single goal that matters but where it fits in their full life. </p><p> Yes, people who have a mantra of &ldquo;whatever it takes&rdquo; often do create some level of success in a particular area. However, Succeeders recognize that each goal is a part of the whole picture,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/break-out-of-your-comfort-zone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a single spoke on a larger wheel  </a> </u> . </p><p> <strong>  Never One and Done </strong></p><p> Succeeders rarely achieve their goal and go back to their old ways. They&rsquo;ve made success a habit and thrive on the adrenaline rush of meeting big goals. Most marathoners I know train for one, and the next day are already looking towards their next. </p><p> Similarly, the people who make the greatest impact at work not only share their ideas but take on the challenge of moving the work forward. They&rsquo;re constantly working on special projects because they suggest them and raise their hands&hellip; and it gets noticed.  </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Never+shying+away+from+a+challenge%2C%C2%A0Succeeders+make+excellence+a+habit.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/how-to-achieve-your-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Never shying away from a challenge, Succeeders make excellence a habit.  </a> </u></p><p> Some Succeeders become addicted to bigger, bolder and more aggressive goals yet still struggle with figuring out their next step.  They know where they&rsquo;ve been and all they&rsquo;ve done to get them to where they are, but need support on what&rsquo;s next. The key is that once they find clarity, Succeeders are on their way. </p><h3> Homework for Succeeders:</h3><p> <br/> 1) Never stop dreaming. When you stop being creative, innovating and dreaming, you&rsquo;re done. Continue to build on your success by allowing yourself to dream about what&rsquo;s next, play with concepts, and bring them to life. </p><p> 2) Continue to stretch and grow. Just like you need to expand your goals, you should also continue to work on yourself. Take on new challenges, focus on learning and personal development. </p><p> 3) Chase the butterflies.  Safety didn&rsquo;t make you a Succeeder.  You took risks to get where you are.  When you feel the butterflies, you know you&rsquo;re headed in the right direction. Continue to find things that excite and energize you to be and do your best. </p><p> Where do you fit? Do you recognize yourself across all three? </p><p> <strong>  Ask yourself: </strong></p><p> Where am I a Wisher? At work? With my fitness goals?</p><p> Where am I a Persister? With my business? With my relationship?</p><p> Where am I a Succeeder? Travel? Blogging? Writing? Running?</p><p> Now ask yourself, what&rsquo;s one step, no matter how small it may seem, that I can take to move forward?</p><p> In my practice, I love to work with Wishers who are ready to open the door to success by finally taking action despite their fears. I also challenge Persisters to change up their game and break the frame to create higher levels of success. Lastly, Succeeders don&rsquo;t need me to push them but instead turn the spotlight within to continue to expand.</p>",

    "content": "<p> It is becoming more obvious that <strong>  stress plays a major role in insomnia. </strong> The development of insomnia is largely determined by <strong>  how we react to stress&ndash;both psychologically and physically. </strong> We all may experience what we refer to as transient insomnia after a stressful event. However, for some of us, stressors such as <strong>  illness, work schedule changes, and interpersonal conflict can lead to chronic insomnia </strong> . The question is&hellip;why?</p><p> We know that those most vulnerable to stress-induced insomnia seem to have the poorest coping skills. They are more likely to ruminate and suffer frequent mental intrusions, especially around bedtime, about the stressful events of their lives. As a result, they present to sleep specialists such as myself with the classic complaint of &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t shut my mind down.&rdquo; This makes it very difficult for them to fall or stay asleep.</p><p> Many of us with chronic insomnia seem to be not only psychologically ill prepared to deal with stress, but physiologically as well. We know that many with chronic insomnia experience an overproduction of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Several studies have demonstrated that those predisposed to stress-induced insomnia have an overactive sympathetic (fight or flight) nervous system as well as a hyperactive HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) axis resulting in the overproduction of stress hormones. As a result, sleep is severely impaired and disrupted.</p><p> Even more bothersome is the fact that deep slow wave sleep is known to reduce the levels of these stress hormones and decrease the activity of the HPA axis. Wakefulness, on the other hand, increases its output. Thus, insufficient sleep tends to promote a vicious cycle resulting in ever-increasing levels of sleep-inhibiting stress hormones.</p><p> Finally, add to this the fact that <strong>  high levels of cortisol can decrease levels of melatonin, a major sleep-promoting neuro hormone </strong> , which results in an even poorer environment for sleep onset.</p><p> <strong>  Fifteen percent of Americans suffer from chronic insomnia with a majority experiencing it because of chronic stress. </strong> Therefore, stress coping skills are crucial. First, lifestyle changes needed. Regular daily exercise coupled with the elimination of nicotine and caffeine is a good start. Cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, hypnosis, and in some instances seeing a therapist can help diminish arousal levels and intrusive thoughts. There are also sites online that offer help in coping with stress and insomnia.</p><p> It is important to recognize that your lack of sleep may very likely be related to how you deal with stress. The reason so many insomniacs relapse when they stop taking sleeping pills is that they fail to deal with the underlying problem. That problem is their inability to manage stress. Learn to manage your stress. If you need help, get it. If you do, you are more likely to reap the benefits of uninterrupted deep sleep.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Lauren Davis </u></p><p> Social media has transformed the way people communicate with each other and how brands represent themselves. With today&rsquo;s social tools, a reputation can be tarnished instantly by a spiteful client. We&rsquo;re no longer judged as a book is by its cover, but rather by the social media pages that comprise our brand identity.</p><p> One wrong turn on social media could put your business in jeopardy. This is especially true for RIAs. Even if you&rsquo;re not trying to expand your business, simply maintaining clients requires a thoughtful, active social media strategy.</p><p> When implementing a social media strategy, make sure you avoid these common &ndash; albeit costly &ndash;mistakes.</p><li> <strong>  No presence. </strong>  The biggest mistake is not having a social media presence. Nowadays, clients and prospects are researching you before even shaking hands, and most people start with social media. To many, it&rsquo;s suspicious if they don&rsquo;t find a social media profile &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, YouTube, etc. &ndash; representing your company. <p>  At the very minimum, set up an account on the most common social media networks &ndash; it&rsquo;s the equivalent of hanging a sign outside your door letting people know you&rsquo;re open for business. </p></li><li> <strong>  Not blogging. </strong>  At  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u> , we believe that the foundation for a strong social media campaign is a blog. It&rsquo;s an easy way to control your content and create a central hub connecting all of your company&rsquo;s social media platforms. <p>  With a blog, you have the freedom to write about whatever you want. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to opine about the news, offer advice and showcase your expertise. From there, you can utilize Facebook, Twitter, etc., to drive traffic back to your blog and your web site. </p></li><li> <strong>  Canned posts. </strong>  There is a reason it&rsquo;s called social. Users and brands alike are expected to interact with one another. If someone visits your social feed and notices nothing but dry and, worst of all, obviously canned updates, it comes across as artificial. Social media is a way to show your firm&rsquo;s personality and expertise. It&rsquo;s certainly fine to plan your posts and updates ahead of time, but pay attention to current headlines and trends. For instance, if there is significant market activity, find a way to acknowledge it. <p>  Lastly, never, ever ignore users that are trying to connect with you to complain, whether it&rsquo;s via a post on your wall or tweeting at you. Ignoring them makes it look like you and your staff are unwilling to deal with and correct criticism. </p></li><li> <strong>  Lacking LinkedIn. </strong>  Did you know that more than  <u>  50 percent of financial advisors </u>  who utilize LinkedIn as a prospecting tool successfully attract new clients? In almost one-third of those cases, the resulting increase in AUM is more than $1 million. LinkedIn is the new networking happy hour. It&rsquo;s where deals begin, contacts are introduced and people go to find influencers. <p>  In addition to offering a very robust and increasingly popular publishing platform, LinkedIn is a virtual resume. It&rsquo;s a chance to showcase your credentials and win new business. As an RIA, you should be putting forth your best foot on this channel. </p> <p>  If you&rsquo;re like me and consider LinkedIn the online equivalent of a networking event, then it&rsquo;s perfectly admissible to send or accept an invitation to or from someone you don&rsquo;t know personally (note: this does not condone spamming). If you have no problem going up to someone new at a conference or networking event and handing them your card, then you have justification to connect with new people on LinkedIn&mdash;just be sure to personalize your note and why you are looking to connect.  <br/>    </p></li><p> As social media infiltrates more and more of our lives and business dealings, it&rsquo;s critical to get your strategy right. Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all formula to implementing a social media campaign, which is why it&rsquo;s important to watch out for the landmines and constantly refresh and update your presence.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Having just finished my new book about Mercedes-Benz and given that I recently spent time with Mercedes-Benz dealers at their annual conference in Las Vegas, I took the liberty of modifying a popular children&rsquo;s logic puzzle by inserting a Mercedes-Benz E class.  Can you solve this puzzle in 20 seconds?  What parking lot number is under the Mercedes-Benz? <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/21.png \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/21.png \"/> </a> Of course the answer is: ________________If for some reason that answer isn&rsquo;t obvious, you must not have turned the puzzle upside down.  Had you done that, the correct answer becomes abundantly clear.The puzzle, like so many of its kind, requires a simple shift of perspective.  The same type of flip that makes the number 87 pop is esential to achieve sustained success in today&rsquo;s customer-driven world.  Too often we look at our businesses from our side of the counter and not through the eyes of our customer.  It is through strategies like the &ldquo;Customer Walk&rdquo; at Starbucks (baristas take turns during each shift to walk from the parking lot looking at the experience from the customer&rsquo;s vantage point) that businesses help their people develop a core competency around seeing customer pain points and creating solutions to produce customer delight.  <strong>  What are you doing to flip perspective and see your business from your customer&rsquo;s point of view? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Many financial advisory firms strive hard for their teams to work together efficiently in order to accomplish desired goals. Unfortunately, the reality is often otherwise.</p><p> The question is, what key factors constitute strong teamwork? What differentiates successful teams from those that flounder and fizzle? Let&rsquo;s take at the six key elements that can be undertaken by a financial company leader to make their teams more effective:</p><h3> Success</h3><p> <br/> Senior financial advisors should clearly define what success means to their advisory firm. Start by identifying the success criteria in conversations with your team. Once defined, write it down and then distribute to everyone. Take the steps to ensure that all team members have a similar vision of success.</p><h3> Clear Plan</h3><p> <br/> Implement a clear cut plan, which includes deadlines and responsibilities, for all the team members to avoid confusion. This plan should address the who, what, when and how. Moreover, it will help each member see what each team member is responsible for and can serve as a mechanism to track each member&rsquo;s progress and help ensure accountability.</p><h3> Ground Rules</h3><p> <br/> Define ground rules for your team. Teams need to operate with rules that encompass factors such as, agendas for meetings, scheduled meeting times and duration, communication method, etc. Remember to determine the ground rules for your team early on.  Similarly, every team is different and has different team rules. There is no one-size-fits-all formula for teams so work together to figure out which ground rules are most important to yours.</p><h3> Communication Styles</h3><p> <br/> Identify the communication styles of all your team members and assign roles accordingly. Who should be the leader, the facilitator or the minute taker? Assess and openly discuss each member&rsquo;s communication strengths and assign their roles depending on their natural capabilities. The more aligned people are with what they naturally do, the better they will perform and the better the team can operate together. Complementary styles work but only when a proactive plan is in place to utilize them.</p><h3> Obstacles</h3><p> <br/> Identify potential obstacles to success. Surface them and organize them according to what the team can control, what they can influence and what is out of their control. The team can then work together as one unit to resolve the ones they can control and can influence with a dedicated focus. Conduct regular meetings with the purpose of identifying and discussing potential problems. Once organized, the team can brainstorm ideas and solutions to address the ones under your control or influence.</p><h3> The &ldquo;I&rdquo; Factor</h3><p> <br/> Be cognizant of the fact that each individual within a team is going to be concerned about their own experiences, viewpoints, values and contributions, despite working efficiently as a unit. Keep this in your mind and your team will prosper. Give people space for them to learn and grow at their own pace within a team, while focusing on the advisory firm&rsquo;s desired goals.</p><p> Working within a team can maximize results for an advisory firm if the leader follows these six essential elements.  <u>  <a href=\"http://advisorssalesacademy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Click here  </a> </u>  to learn more about teamwork and organizational success.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  The greatest challenge for start-ups is hiring the right people into the right positions. </strong> Many times, when you have limited people on a team, <strong>  hiring individuals with broader knowledge and experience who will do anything to get the job done will be far more important than hiring specialists. </strong></p><p> As the leader of a start-up or young company, you need people who dance/jive/contort as the organization needs them to&mdash;people willing to constantly innovate, willing to roll-up their sleeves, get their hands dirty, and not be set in their ways. <strong>  Leaders need to hire people they can guide and people who want to grow with the organization. </strong></p><p> I was a consultant for a company that had grown according to plan and after three years revenues were at a point where they supported hiring a Business Development Manager (BDM).</p><p> The company established some processes and procedures, but as young as it was, the company did not yet have a &ldquo;we do things a certain way&rdquo; mentality. Innovation was a constant. Thus, when adding staff, finding the right type of person to fit the culture was an unspoken must. New hires needed to be open-minded, flexible, and comfortable with change or so it seemed.</p><p> The person hired for the position came from a long-established, large organization. The hiring executive thought hiring someone with 20 years of industry experience would bring a treasure trove of knowledge and ideas to their young organization. It was assumed this newly-hired BDM would operate independently, allowing others in the company to continue building the brand and executing the marketing plan while he brought in new business.</p><p> The problem was that while this new hire was knowledgeable of the industry and had extensive business development experience on paper (with proven results), one vital question was never asked during the hiring process: <strong>  &ldquo;How did you achieve your results?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Within three months of the BDM&rsquo;s hire, it became obvious that he was accustomed to delegating most activities. In his previous position, he had the luxury of working with specialists and support staff, and had never done many of the administrative functions related to business development. In his new position, it was clear he had neither the desire to &ldquo;get into the weeds&rdquo; nor the knowledge to be efficient in many such activities.</p><p> His desire to delegate all activities not directly associated with business development, increased the stress levels of a handful of people within the organization to whom he routinely turned for support. As a result, everyone began to see this business development manager as combative and inflexible. He was viewed as someone who complained rather than offered solutions, and as an individual contributor rather than a team player.</p><p> All or most of the hiring manager&rsquo;s assumptions had been incorrect. Signs of &ldquo;bad hire&rdquo; who was &ldquo;not a cultural fit&rdquo; began to surface.</p><p> People began to avoid this manager and work around him. This increased their own challenges for getting things done and lowered efficiency across the company. Resentment set in and the manager became isolated. He no longer got the support he needed to grow new business. A &ldquo;me-versus-them&rdquo; mentality began to dominate the company culture.</p><p> If you are a leader in a young company, or a company that has major growth as its strategy, <strong>  hire people who </strong> :</p><li> Have experience working in start-up or other dynamic environments.</li><li> Have &ldquo;do what it takes to get the job done&rdquo; attitudes.</li><li> Understand how their actions affect others and company goals.</li><li> Can work with others in a team environment.</li><li> Are more concerned with company goals than they are with adding lines to their resumes.</li><li> Are more concerned with upside potential three or four years down the road than they are with their current compensation levels.</li><li> Are independent decision-makers who can prioritize their activities.</li><li> Never blame others for failures and are able to learn from their mistakes.</li><li> Are willing to take on new challenges and new ways of doing things.</li><li> Have expectations of the position that are reasonable and that align with your own.</li>",

    "content": "<p> My friend  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NiklasMyhr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Niklas Myhr  </a> </u> , the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://niklasmyhr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Media Professor  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; recently blogged about something I&rsquo;m very passionate about,  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesocialmediaprofessor.com/social-media-quality-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Media and Quality Management  </a> </u> . In his post he discusses tapping your social advocates early on in the product and/or service development phase, listening to what they have to say and learning more about what they want and how you can deliver it to them.</p><p> I think there&rsquo;s room for much more of this type of thinking. The old concept of keeping things close to the vest until they&rsquo;re launched is not only short-sighted, it puts brands at a severe disadvantage in today&rsquo;s hyper-competitive world. And yet, if you look around, there are still many brands that stubbornly refuse to change. I think that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not thinking about advocacy from the inside out.</p><p> The socially nimble company tasks its employees with &ldquo;opening their listening ears&rdquo; and tapping into  <u>  community intelligence </u>  (both the company&rsquo;s and the employee&rsquo;s communities), then acting on what they&rsquo;ve learned. This can put you in a much better position than your competitors in two ways: 1) getting a well-focused product to market much faster, and 2) earning a higher level of marketplace trust and identification with your brand.</p><p> Everybody knows that the faster you can innovate and get things moving, the better&mdash;and every brand wants to build trust&mdash;but identifying and listening to social advocates is still not considered a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; in much of the corporate world, much less empowering employees to take advantage of opportunities outside the company&rsquo;s social community. Instead of looking at social advocacy from a &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; standpoint, brands would be much better served to adopt &ldquo;learn-learn,&rdquo; as their social philosophy.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t the same thing as crowdsourcing. Some big brands are investing and experiencing success in crowdsourcing. PepsiCo increased its initiatives by more than 300 percent in 2014, and Reckitt-Benckiser (a leading pharma brand), bumped theirs up by 200 percent. But you don&rsquo;t have to invest in crowdsourcing platforms in order to listen and learn from your communities. It can (and should) be done on the individual level, because companies aren&rsquo;t faceless business machines&mdash;they&rsquo;re made up of individuals&mdash;and in any community, people like to interact with other people.</p><p> I think it comes down to changing your brand&rsquo;s social goals and habits from the top down. Everyone from C-suite execs to customer service employees can practice listening and reaching out to individuals to expand conversation and deepen relationships. There&rsquo;s no substitute for this. While there are enterprise advocacy platforms out there (just Google the term and you&rsquo;ll get around 1,500,000 results), anyone can invest a few minutes a day practicing focused listening on any social platform. We&rsquo;re just not making it a priority. Why? It comes down to the old ROI argument, and that&rsquo;s where I think many brands are falling short. They&rsquo;re still trying to silo social listening within marketing and sales departments (and measure effectiveness in terms of sales, versus relationships), when it should be a company-wide practice that envelopes all business functions.</p><p> Every business function depends on the quality of the human relationships needed to perform that function. The more we practice using social to learn more about who makes up our communities and how we can serve them better (at every level), the more in-tune we&rsquo;ll be and the more harmony we can create both inside and outside our companies.</p><p> <strong>  Want your brand to be more successful? Wrap social around every business practice. And while you&rsquo;re doing so, ditch the win-win mentality, which denotes an ending&mdash;not a continuation. Embracing learn-learn increases the value of relationships for all parties. </strong></p>",

As we continue our journey into the many discourses that explore how we as leaders manifest certain body dispositions, lets look at one known as the King or Queen archetype, the Analytical, or the Stability body. In this body we see the following:</p><p> <strong>  Overall view of the world: </strong> This is the body of the scientist, the analyst, the deep thinker that allows individuals to stop and remain calm and grounded in the body in uncomfortable situations. It is the body that thrives when there is methodical and systematic work to do. This is the body that does not get caught up in the moods or emotions of the event or interaction. While this can be helpful at times, the body can create challenges where action is required, due to its propensity to stay in one place.</p><p> <strong>  Moods and emotions: </strong>  Because this body remains grounded and calm at all times, moods and emotions are not near the surface in this body, nor do others readily see them. This body allows the person to see the facts and data surrounding the situation, as opposed to the perceived unpredictable and unreliable moods and emotions. The moods and emotions may be present and intense, but this body does not allow them to be shown to the world. In many instances, the body may not allow its owner to feel the mood or emotion, but rather keeps the person methodically and steadily moving along. Whether the situation is negative or positive, others may see this person as uncaring, cold, stoic, or unmotivated because of the perceived lack of moods or emotions that others presume should be present. At its core, when in this body, logic and correctness rule the day, much like a stately and regal King or Queen &ndash; hence the name.</p><p> <strong>  How it manifests in the body:  </strong> The body is controlled and methodical, preferring to stay the course or maintain a position rather than take quick action. The face remains non-committal, the quintessential poker face, not showing what mood or emotion of the wearer. The mouth is neutral, betraying no hint of next steps. Feet are planted firmly on the ground, as if roots are growing, not in any hurry to move from the current reality. The knees are not locked. The arms and hands are at one&rsquo;s side, ready to move as needed, but not mimicking, through movement, the energy of other body styles. The energy and movement of the body is minimal, only committing to change when there are logical reasons to take action. The body allows the owner to remain calm in the storm, and perhaps to expand their command out over vast lands, the monarch of a kingdom.</p><p> <strong>  The Mantra of this body: </strong>  The mantra that arises in this body is &ldquo;everything is right and correct in my Kingdom!&rdquo; or &ldquo;slow and steady leads to a correct and secure future.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Where this body might serve or hinder you:  </strong> The advantages of the king/queen body dispositions are that they allow one to remain calm and steady in turbulent times or situations. It allows logic, history, and process to overrule chaos and emotions in times of uncertainty or change. The body does not get caught up in the latest fad or flavor of the week, but rather relies on what is known and proven. Where this body can create challenges is in situations where there is not a proven process or history, but rather an ability to make quick and decisive changes is required. This body also creates challenges in situations where the perceived lack of ability to show emotion delegitimizes a situation, causing others to feel this person is cold, uncaring, or lacks passion.</p><p> At work, being the King/Queen can have very powerful effect on the team and an organization&rsquo;s ability to get the correct answer, systematically approaching problems from a grounded and proven methodology. With it though, comes the downside of a body that is challenged by change and flexibility, and unresponsive to the immediate need to take quick action and show the intense emotions that the situation may require.</p>",

    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s always a good idea to evaluate your industry&rsquo;s competitive landscape. You&rsquo;ll probably learn a lot in the process and might gain a competitive advantage over your peers. However, rather than just reading about the robos from third party sources, it&rsquo;s important to do some first-hand research for yourself to truly understand the value proposition of online automated financial advice platforms. Below is a list of automated financial advice platforms to visit that provide a good snapshot of the players in the space and might also provide some helpful tips for online marketing for your practice. <strong>  Robo Sites to Visit: </strong> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sigfig.com/site/#/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SigFig  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Betterment  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.learnvest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LearnVest  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.wealthfront.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wealthfront  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Personal Capital  </a> </u> As you visit these sites, take note of the following characteristics that the robos share:Visuals: The sites have a clean design and limit the number of links so that they can guide the visitor to take action by either learning more or signing up.Language: The web sites use positive language delivered in a results-oriented fashion. They seek to help visitors feel smart and in control of their finances, and you don&rsquo;t need a degree in finance to understand what they are saying.It&rsquo;s important to note that a 2014 Money Market Institute survey showed that the #1 thing high-net-worth clients wanted from financial advisors was help making smart decisions with their money.1Cost: None of them hide from fees. In fact, they highlight them on their sites and often offer tiered service plans.</p><h3> Why Do the Robos Warrant Attention?</h3><strong> Consumption Habits Are Changing</strong>Think about the last time you wanted to buy a car. Did you go straight to the lot or did you do some homework first, researching your options, prices and customer reviews?According to <u> <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HubSpot.com </a></u>, &ldquo;The trend can&rsquo;t be ignored any longer: Buyers are more informed and self-sufficient than ever before. They can do all the research they want about a particular product or service on the company website, and even buy online if the option is available.&rdquo;2 The internet and the digitalization of information have given buyers more power than ever to access the information they want and to buy on their own terms when they are ready. The robos capitalize on their ability to provide customers what they want when they want it. However, they currently lack the ability to provide more sophisticated financial planning services and they certainly are not adept at talking clients off the ledge in difficult market environments.<strong> Trust in the Financial Services Industry Is Lacking</strong>Is it possible for someone to trust a machine more than a human? Maybe, if the industry ranks at the bottom of the list of all industries in terms of trust. According to the 2015 <u> <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/252750985/2015-Edelman-Trust-Barometer-Executive-Summary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Edelman Trust Barometer </a></u> study, the financial services industry ranks at the bottom of the industry sector trust list, with only banks and the media being less trusted. Many clients have had bad experiences with advisors, but it is more likely that the media has played a part in promoting the negative impression that vexes our industry. The fact that asset managers have traditionally focused on product performance rather than specific client needs hasn&rsquo;t helped. Our industry should see this as an opportunity to re-focus our efforts and become client centric. &ldquo;Products are transient; basic needs and consumer groups endure forever&hellip; viewing businesses in terms of customer needs can suggest additional growth opportunities.&rdquo;3<strong> The Robos Provide Ideas for Enhancing the Client Experience</strong>Realistically, we will all read more articles about robo advisors, but it&rsquo;s important do so after taking a look at the subject matter for ourselves. The world is embracing digital advancements in every industry, and by embracing new ideas, advisors just might uncover the next great idea and identify new opportunities. These are early days for robo advisors. As automated investment platforms continue to evolve, they may ultimately give rise to a more digitally savvy financial advisor. By combining human collaboration with cutting-edge technology, we may be able to increase the likelihood that clients reach their financial goals.",

    "content": "<p> It has happened and will happen to every professional who deals with clients: something goes wrong or your client gets upset about something you've done or said. Here are eight tips for dealing with an unhappy client and starting the process of resolution:</p><li> Respond rapidly. If a client is unhappy, deal with it  immediately . Your willingness to drop what you&rsquo;re doing to urgently discuss your client&rsquo;s concerns will by itself improve the situation.</li><li> Listen without being defensive. When someone is upset, emotions are like facts. Listen deeply, and thank your client for sharing their concerns with you.</li><li> Say you&rsquo;re sorry.  Even if you think the blame is equally spread, apologizing can help to defuse the situation and begin a new dialog. It&rsquo;s hard to keep kicking someone when they apologize to you.</li><li> Collaborate on the solution. Don&rsquo;t jump too quickly to a solution (&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put a new project manager in immediately&hellip;&rdquo;). Involve your client in developing it, and only do so after thoroughly understanding all of their concerns and the actual circumstances.</li><li> Offer amends.  If in fact you have fallen short in some way, it can help to restore trust if you offer amends, e.g., doing a small piece of value-added work for the client, or reducing an invoice.</li><li> Avoid excuses.  It&rsquo;s very natural to want to explain to the client all the reasons why you are not completely at fault, and why they may share some of the blame. But save that for later&mdash;if ever. </li><li> Rebuild trust through small, frequent, confidence-building measures.  When trust is lost, you must increase transparency and communication, and show you can deliver on small, discrete, agreed-upon follow-up steps.</li><li> Get things out into the open.  When negative emotions are kept in the dark, they fester and grow. When you get them out into the light of day, they shrink and often disappear. This is illustrated in the opening stanza of William Blake&rsquo;s famous poem,  A Poison Tree: <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  A Poison Tree </strong></p><p> by William Blake  (1757-1827)</p><p> I was angry with my friend:</p><p> I told my wrath, my wrath did end.</p><p> I was angry with my foe;</p><p> I told it not, my wrath did grow.</p>",

Among the findings is that <strong>  blacks and, to a lesser extent, Latinos have difficulty trusting planners. </strong></p><p> Past research shows trust can play an important role in financial decisions. People who trust the stock market, for example, are more likely to invest in stocks. But black Americans start out with generally lower trust levels: nearly half reported &ldquo;low trust,&rdquo; compared with only about one-quarter of whites, according to the survey data used by three finance professors in their study last year.</p><p> The researchers then assessed whether trust levels affected two specific behaviors: hiring a financial planner and saving for retirement.</p><p> A lack of trust reduced the likelihood an individual will engage a planner by 18 percentage points, compared to individuals who tend to be more trusting. The surprising result was that <strong>  blacks were actually more likely to hire a financial planner than were whites with similar incomes when the researchers controlled for trust &ndash; meaning the controls eliminated differences in behavior related to individual trust levels. </strong></p><p> Another finding was that while blacks have less retirement savings than do white Americans of similar incomes, this difference virtually disappears when the analysis controls for the difference in their trust levels.</p><p> If black Americans could get past their inherent lack of trust and get good advice or good financial products things might be different, said one of the study&rsquo;s authors, Terrance Martin, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas-Pan American in south Texas.</p><p> &ldquo;You might see less of a difference between black households&rsquo; accumulated retirement saving relative to white households,&rdquo; Martin said.</p>",

    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> One of the most common questions that companies have about a website redesign is: &ldquo;How much does it cost to build a website?&rdquo;</p><p> While I&rsquo;ll give you some  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-website/#actualcost\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   actual numbers below  </a> </u> , as well as some  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-website/#considerations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pricing considerations you may not have thought of  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-website/#prof\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   some circumstances that warrant more spending on a website  </a> </u> , I have to start by saying that the cost of redesigning your website can vary.  It depends on if you plan to do it yourself or if you have a website design firm build a custom website for you.  Other factors can affect cost, too.</p><h3> Factors That Affect the Cost to Build Your Website</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s why the cost to build a website varies so much.  Building a website is a lot like building a home. You can build a small 3 bedroom, 1 bath starter home on a small lot, and that&rsquo;s going to cost a lot less than a 4 bedroom, 2.5 bath family home in a nice neighborhood or a much larger home with a pool on a golf course.</p><p> You get the picture. So here are some factors that can affect the cost of your website redesign:</p><li> Will your website have a &ldquo;custom&rdquo; design that&rsquo;s unique to you, or will it be a templated design that may be strikingly similar to other websites?</li><li> How many pages will your website contain?</li><li> Will you need multiple designs to choose from?</li><li> Will your new site be optimized for search engines?</li><li> Will your website be  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/what-is-responsive-website-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   designed for phones, tablets and computer screens  </a> </u> ?</li><li> Will you need someone to organize pages into sections and determine appropriate linkages between pages?</li><li> Will your website be used to provide a steady flow of business opportunities?</li><li> Will you define your ideal customer so you know how to write and organize your website?</li><li> Will you  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/website-content-development-planning-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   write your own website  </a> </u>  or have a professional do it for you?</li><li> Will your website have a blog?</li><li> Will your website include detailed reporting and analytics?</li><li> Will your website require any specialized features, like a quoting system, maps, payment processing, logins, linkage with a CRM, etc.?</li><li> Does your web server have nightly backup and a server engineer on call in case of an outage or problem?</li><li> Will your website have an &ldquo;open source&rdquo; (free) or commercial  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-content-management-system-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content management system  </a> </u> ?</li><li> Will you want a training workshop to show staff how to update the website? <br/>  </li><h3> The Cost of Having Your Website Professionally Built</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;re a web design company, so I&rsquo;ll focus this article with the assumption that you&rsquo;re at least researching the option of having a company professionally build your new website. I&rsquo;ll also say that the prices below are our prices, and that some firms charge a lot less than we do, and some charge a lot more.</p><h3> Base Cost of a Website Redesign</h3><br/>According to a survey, the average cost of a website redesign is $38,572.<p> <strong>  The &ldquo;base cost&rdquo; for a professional website redesign is $15,000. </strong>   A $15,000 website is intended for small businesses and would include the following:</p><li> Basic target audience research</li><li> One custom website design that&rsquo;s a unique, one-of-a-kind website designed from scratch</li><li> Roughly 10-15 pages</li><li> A mobile friendly, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/what-is-responsive-website-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   responsive design  </a> </u> &rdquo; that is so critical for good exposure on Google</li><li> A content management system that&rsquo;s customized to suit your staff&rsquo;s technical abilities</li><li> Recorded training session to show you how to use and update your website <br/>  </li><p> As I mentioned earlier, the more options and requirements that your website has, the more the website costs to build (just like in the example of the house). I&rsquo;ll also say that very few websites will fall under the &ldquo;base price&rdquo; you see above, so let&rsquo;s explore some other pricing details below.</p><h3> Average Cost of a Website Redesign</h3><p> <br/> So if a base website costs $15,000, then what&rsquo;s the top end of a professional website redesign?</p><p> <strong>  Very few of our website redesign projects exceed $60,000, with a vast majority falling in the price range of $25,000 &ndash; $40,000.  </strong></p><p> What makes these websites different from the $15,000 website?  Here are a few &ldquo;options&rdquo; that we typically would build into a new website, which in turn raises the price:</p><li> Detailed research on your ideal customers and their needs</li><li> A commercial content management system that not only lets you manage your website easily, but also lets you store in-depth information about visitors for marketing and sales reasons</li><li> One or more professionally-written detailed guides/e-books/whitepapers that you can use to generate sales leads</li><li> A content strategy/roadmap of future additions to your website to attract and convert visitors</li><li> More than 10 professionally-written pages <br/>  </li><p> Of course, companies that pay extra for these things tend to get more business opportunities on a monthly basis than those that don&rsquo;t.  Spending a little more up front can pay big dividends over the life of the website, as the information on your website produces results month after month.</p><p> What you see above is our pricing, so here&rsquo;s some outside perspective on cost. According to HubSpot&rsquo;s &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/file-13222061-pdf/docs/ebooks/science_of_website_redesign_presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Science of Website Redesign  </a> </u> &rdquo; webinar and report that surveyed over 100 small and medium-sized companies, <strong>   the average cost of a website redesign (2013 data) was $38,572. </strong></p><h3> Ongoing Costs </h3><p> <br/> Just like you may pay for maintenance on your home, websites generally have some ongoing costs that you should consider in any price discussion.  Here are some of those ongoing costs that you&rsquo;ll need to factor into your budget:</p>Budget itemWhat is this?CostWeb hosting (required)You pay for a server that&rsquo;s connected to the web 24/7/365, and your website lives there. This includes nightly backup and an on-call server engineer.$50 per month &ndash; $150+ per month depending on the complexity of your websiteSupport and training (optional)You may need help updating certain things on your website that are more design-oriented. You may also need someone to walk you through making changes from time to time.$250 per monthContent creation (optional)Get help writing your blog or adding/improving web page writing.$1,200 &ndash; $3,500 per month depending on volume.Search engine optimizationTaking steps on a regular basis to make sure your website is visible and optimized for search engines.$1,000 &ndash; $2,000 per month<h3> <br/> The Cost of Building Your Own Website</h3><br/>On average, you&rsquo;ll spend 28% less on a do-it-yourself website redesign.<p> In the spirit of presenting the other side of this story, I want to explore what it might cost to build your website yourself (in-house using your own employees). Hopefully this will provide enough information to help you decide which route is best for your company.</p><p> Rather than rely on speculation, let&rsquo;s again look at HubSpot&rsquo;s &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/file-13222061-pdf/docs/ebooks/science_of_website_redesign_presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Science of Website Redesign  </a> </u> &rdquo; report for answers on how much it costs to build your own website.  <strong>  The reported cost of a website redesign that&rsquo;s done internally is $30,106. </strong></p><p> <strong>  On average, you&rsquo;ll spend 28% less on a do-it-yourself website redesign. </strong></p><p> Also keep in mind that the ongoing costs mentioned above also apply if you are building your new website internally.</p><p> You might think that if your company employees build your new website, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;free.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not always the case, because most small and medium sized companies don&rsquo;t have a dedicated web person that&rsquo;s paid just to work on the website.</p><p> In most internal website redesigns, a committee or small group is formed to do the work. This responsibility is in addition to normal work responsibilities.</p><h3> Pitfalls to Building Your Own Website Internally</h3><p> <br/> Because I&rsquo;ve personally managed a few internal website redesign projects, I speak from experience when I say there are some &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; that you might not know about at the beginning of the project:</p><li> If you are rewriting, updating or editing your existing website, it takes time to gather information from the expert sources at your company. They may not be on the web team you&rsquo;ve assembled, so they may have difficulty devoting time to updating website information in addition to their normal responsibilities. As a result, only 49% of websites are completed on time (according to the report mentioned above).</li><li> When delays occur in any part of the website redesign project, management may become impatient. The focus then becomes &ldquo;getting it done,&rdquo; not doing it right. The customer experience then suffers as a result, which can affect sales or the number of new business opportunities.</li><li> It takes much longer to write web pages that you may think.  In my experience, websites take 4x longer to write when you write your own web pages.</li><li> The cost of not communicating properly to your customer can cost tens of thousands (if not more) over the life of the website. Internally written websites, while often factual, tend to be written more for the company than with the customer in mind. <br/>  </li><h3> Website Cost Considerations You May Not Have Thought Of <h3>  <br/>  Is Your Website Really Ever &ldquo;Done?&rdquo; </h3></h3><p> <br/> Your website isn&rsquo;t a brochure. When you design and print a brochure, you hand them out until they&rsquo;re gone. You can&rsquo;t make a change &mdash; they are already printed.</p><p> A website is exactly the opposite. You have a plethora of ways to measure your website&rsquo;s effectiveness and make changes to it.  In fact, I would challenge you to change/test something on your website every month.</p><p> Once you complete the website redesign, you can&rsquo;t just forget it and never update it. If you are building your website as a sales engine and customer resource, you should be constantly adding information. This is true regardless of if your website is designed internally or outsourced to a design firm.</p><h3> &ldquo;Financing&rdquo; a Website Redesign</h3><p> <br/> When we complete a website redesign, we offer two different payment options.  You can pay for the website in three payments, or you can divide the cost of the website over 12-36 months and pay a flat monthly fee.  Paying $1,000 per month for 24 months might be more budget friendly for your company than paying $24,000 over the course of the typical 4 month project.</p><h3> Marketing and Sales Software Costs</h3><p> <br/> If you are looking to attract business from your website, you may choose to include marketing/sales software that runs your website but also serves other functions. This software can range from $99 per month to $2,500 per month in addition to the cost of building the website.</p><h3> &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; Approach Versus &ldquo;Incremental Redesign&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> You may think that completely overhauling your website all at once is the only way to update your website, but there&rsquo;s also an option to incrementally redesign your website.  For example, you can redesign your website in 4-8 weeks &mdash; updating the look and the words on the homepage, but keeping all other information the same.  In subsequent months, you&rsquo;d revisit, re-write, optimize and restructure all of the other pages.  This may take several months to complete, but because it&rsquo;s done in small chunks, it&rsquo;s easier to make progress and build on results over time.</p><p> As the new website evolves from old to new, pages are tested and improved using performance data. With an approach like this, you get incrementally better results as you improve and add features that your customers can use.</p><h3> When is the Extra Cost of a Professional Outsourced Website Justified?</h3><p> <br/> There are certainly  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.squarespace.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   do-it-yourself options  </a> </u> , you can  <u>  <a href=\"http://themeforest.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   buy a template  </a> </u>  and customize it, or design a custom website with an in-house designer or team.</p><p> But since you&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;re likely researching how the cost of building your own website compares to the cost of outsourcing the work to a professional firm.</p><p> When you are evaluating website redesign cost,  <strong>  there&rsquo;s more to the decision than the one-time or monthly cost. Another factor to consider is how many new business opportunities a new website might win for your business. </strong></p><p> So when is the extra cost of outsourcing worth it?  Here are some legitimate reasons you might consider paying more for your website:</p><li> Your company is seeking growth but you haven&rsquo;t used your website to deliberately get that growth in the past.</li><li> The website needs to educate to sell, not just talk about the company.</li><li> You want to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/website-accountability-profit-center/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   make the website accountable for business results  </a> </u> .</li><li> Your company needs to satisfy investors that are concerned with business performance.</li><li> Other sales tactics like trade shows or advertising have gotten too expensive or not producing the outcomes that your company needs.</li><li> From a sales perspective, it&rsquo;s critical that your company communicate well with your target audiences. <br/>  </li><p> There you have it &mdash; the complete guide to how much it costs to build a website.

After all, without the dark we wouldn&rsquo;t have the light!</p><p> Most of us don&rsquo;t realize that there are patterns to how we fight&hellip;and make-up if we so choose to work at it. Ask yourself:</p><p> Are you having the same fight over and over again?</p><p> Your arguments might be more common than you think. Can you relate to this awesome video?</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Fio7T6mjCbI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-16-at-10.55.02-AM.png\" width=\"851\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><h3> The Science of Fighting</h3><p> <br/> According to Marriage and Family counselor Dr. John Gottman, a true expert in this field, 69% of marriage conflicts are never solved. Yes, 69%!</p><p> That means that we are often having the same fight over and over again.</p><p> This is actually good news. Why? If we have similarities or patterns to our fights it means a) we are not alone and b) we can study, predict and course-correct our arguments before they explode.</p><p> Dr. John Gottman has over 40 years of research with over 3,000 married couples. He calls these unresolved issues &lsquo;gridlocked&rsquo;. Watch this video for more:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fCM4L2ll0YM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-16-at-11.02.52-AM.png\" width=\"848\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> Gridlocked Issue: A common topic that comes up for a couple that cannot be resolved and typically devolves into a nasty argument.</p><h3> The Top 5 Issues Couples Fight About:</h3><p> <br/> What do most couples fight about? Here are the 5 most common issues:</p><li> Free Time</li><li> Money</li><li> Housework</li><li> Physical Intimacy</li><li> Extended Family</li><h3> Fighting Solutions:</h3><p> <br/> Here are some ways you can use the science of couples to help your relationship:</p><p> <strong>  1. The New Mindset </strong></p><p> How to Fight Better: I want us to shift the focus to fighting &lsquo;better&rsquo; as opposed to fighting less. Why? Fighting better is about having discussions, not arguments. It is about respectfully hearing the other person when perpetual problems come up. It&rsquo;s also a lot of pressure to try to fight less. We all want to fight less, but the point of this article is to deepen understanding and that can mean discussing more.</p><p> <strong>  2. Identify Your Issues </strong></p><p> One of the most interesting discussions I have ever had with my husband was identifying our &lsquo;perpetual issues&rsquo;. We sat down and thought about the problems and topics that have come up recently and looked for patterns. Did any of them fall into the top 5 above? Were there any common threads or underlying themes to our arguments. The answer&mdash;yes. We didn&rsquo;t realize it at first, but we were basically having the same 3 arguments over and over again with different dressing.</p><li> Sit down with your partner (or with a journal by yourself) and review all of the arguments you have had recently or any big blow-up fights over the last few months. Try to identify the patterns under the arguments.</li><li> Once you have identified your patterns, clearly delineate each partner&rsquo;s side of the argument. Do this in non-judgmental terms. For example, an issue could be &lsquo;spending.&rsquo; Husband likes to treat himself to little dinners out regularly, whereas Wife likes to save up for big treats. Neither is &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; but this way you know where you both stand.</li><p> <strong>  3. Localize Don&rsquo;t Globalize </strong></p><p> One reason that little arguments can erupt so quickly is because a small disagreement can be tagged onto one of your larger arguments and immediately explode into the big fight. You already know your issues and where the other stands, so it is very important to keep small arguments compartmentalized and specific to the situation. This can help you focus on the issue and keep the discussion as just that&mdash;a discussion. Since you know you have fundamental differences on the larger argument, there is no reason to bring it into everyday discussions.</p><li> Try to avoid globalizing the other person or their behavior. Try not to say &ldquo;You always do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is your pattern&rdquo; or &ldquo;You never&hellip;&rdquo;</li><li> Don&rsquo;t call up past arguments or offenses. I know it&rsquo;s hard, but it will only exacerbate an issue that is gridlocked (devolving into a larger fight).</li><p> And by the way, you aren&rsquo;t the only couple who fights about your issues:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SRMXzq3bN_8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"468\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-16-at-11.06.46-AM.png\" width=\"845\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> <strong>  4. Start with Agreement </strong></p><p> If a gridlocked issue comes up on a daily basis and you need to approach it, start with agreement. Dr. Gottman noticed that successful couples who have been together for a long time master gentleness. They present issues in a soft way by never starting with criticism. In fact, starting with agreement is the best way to avoid an argument and start a discussion. Find something you can agree upon and start there.</p><li> For example, if you have family coming in for the weekend and Wife wants a hotel, but Husband wants house-guests, Wife could say, &ldquo;I know we can agree that family time is important and I know we can both get a little annoyed when we are overrun with nieces and nephews. Let&rsquo;s try to think of a way to make this weekend work.&rdquo;</li><p> <strong>  5. Look Underneath the Argument </strong></p><p> This is the hardest one, but the most important. Sometimes there are underlying issues beneath the gridlocked issue. I want you to think about what&rsquo;s happening behind the argument. Are there value-based differences? You might actually be arguing about basic philosophical concepts like someone&rsquo;s sense of self, power, freedom, care, what family means, what home means or control. Look at your gridlocked issue and ask the question &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; 5 times. *Be sure to get buy-in to do this from both people, so it is exploratory not antagonistic. For example:</p><li> Wife: I am very upset right now.</li><li> Man: Why?</li><li> Wife: I need more help around the house.</li><li> Man: Why do you feel that way?</li><li> Wife: I feel overworked and overwhelmed with the stuff that needs to be done.</li><li> Man: Why do you feel overwhelmed?</li><li> Wife: It just feels like it all lands on me at the end of the day.</li><li> Man: Why do you feel it all lands on you?</li><li> Wife: I don&rsquo;t see you offering to help and that makes me frustrated.</li><li> Man: Why does that happen?</li><li> Wife: It makes me feel under-appreciated. <br/>  </li><p> Ok, now they are onto something! Yes, help around the house is great, but it all boils down to feeling under appreciated. If the husband were to make the wife feel more appreciated&mdash;perhaps thanking her for what has already been done, that might be even more beneficial than helping. Combining help and gratitude could be the ultimate healer in this fight.</p><p> <strong>  6. Acceptance </strong></p><p> Knowing your issues and where you stand can help prevent you from having the argument over and over again. Agreeing to disagree and naming the issue can prevent arguments in the future. For example, I was walking a couple through this exercise and this process happened:</p><li> Common Issue: Vacationing with the in-laws. Husband doesn&rsquo;t like to vacation with his in-laws, Wife does.</li><li> Localize: Trip to Hawaii over Thanksgiving</li><li> Agreement: We both know we need a vacation and we are due for an in-law visit.</li><li> Why&rsquo;s: Wife learns that the reason Husband doesn&rsquo;t like to vacation with the in-laws has nothing to do with them. He loves the in-laws! But he wants more couple time. &ldquo;We are so busy during the work week that our vacations are the only alone time we get together.&rdquo;</li><li> Acceptance: This is a difference in preference&mdash;it is not an attack on the in-laws or a desire not to vacation together. A possible compromise to recognize the underlying need for alone time could be to go on vacation a few days early before the in-laws arrive.</li><li> Success!</li><p> <br/> You want your perpetual issues to be more like the crazy uncle who shows up unannounced and less like the hidden rabid dog in the closet. In other words, the more your issue is talked about, tolerated and discussed, the easier and less trap-filled it will be.</p><p> Sometimes it feels like talking about the nitty-gritty side of romance is taboo, but I think when we explore the issues we learn and benefit. Let&rsquo;s bring the light to the dark.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Mitch Avnet | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/C_R_Concepts?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fcompliance-risk.com%2Fauthor%2Fmitch-avnet&amp;profile_id=1154957834&amp;tw_i=610849645674283008&amp;tw_p=embeddedtimeline&amp;tw_w=310017503185207296\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Compliance Risk Concept  </u> </a></p>As a Former Chief Compliance Officer, I am frequently asked by my clients to help them find /understand where the &ldquo;risk&rdquo; is in their compliance programs / throughout their organizations.   For me, a huge part of an organization&rsquo;s risk profile comes down to the quality of their surveillance protocols and the quality of information gleaned from these processes.As most Compliance Officers within Financial Services recently saw in the widely publicized insider trading case involving the Ex-JP Morgan Banker and his father &ndash; the two were able to devise a scheme utilizing &ldquo;golf-related code&rdquo; in their illegal emails, where &ldquo;tips&rdquo; were provided, enabling the Banker&rsquo;s father to earn over $1 million in illegal profits.In case you missed this, read it here: <u> <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-90.html\" target=\"_blank\">  http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-90.html </a></u><h3> Know the Code?</h3>The following &ldquo;coded&rdquo; emails were pinpointed and referenced by the SEC in their case. Do you think your electronic surveillance platform could have surfaced these communications?Based on the answer I&rsquo;m sure most of us would be afraid to utter, Compliance Officers should be pondering if their electronic surveillance platforms are doing all that they can to help detect, prevent, and <u> <a href=\"http://compliance-risk.com/company/turning-risk-into-reward-the-electronic-flipbook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  mitigate the risk </a></u> associated with deceptive communications.<h3> Searching for a Needle in a Stack of Needles</h3>Within the Financial Services vertical, electronic communications surveillance has become an area where most firms / Compliance officers have become &ldquo;accepting&rdquo; of their process. It has almost become an area where firms /individuals rest on their laurels &ndash; assuming their process will pass muster with the regulators, satisfying the <u> review and retention requirements</u> stipulated by FINRA and the SEC.This &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; leaves firms exposed. Since most electronic surveillance technologies are based on key word / key phrase searches, they often come up short in terms of their overall utility to an organization. In fact, most individuals charged with the supervisory responsibility of reviewing emails often complain about the redundancy in the process / the amount of false positives &ndash; and the valuable time wasted reviewing and approving emails that have no applicability nor present any true risk to their organizations. Truthfully, I&rsquo;ve heard the process described as worse than &ldquo;finding a needle in a haystack&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;finding a needle in a stack of needles&rdquo;.<h3> Is There a Better Way?</h3>As fraud-detection technologies have evolved, better solutions have emerged. Now, technologies exist that are policy driven, relying on complex algorithms to identify &ldquo;behaviors&rdquo;. As these technologies improve, they will actually learn from the behaviors you don&rsquo;t want to see versus the ones you do.The Ex- JP Morgan Banker case presents an interesting dilemma for firms. Do you still rely on <u> <a href=\"http://compliance-risk.com/egrc/dont-hate-automate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  antiquated technology </a></u> &ndash; or do you use this as an opportunity to test the waters for improved surveillance /detection systems that can help better defend your firm from these types of outcomes.<h3> Is There a Business Case Here? Something All Compliance Officers Should Ponder&hellip;</h3>In the end, nothing can protect a firm against an employee driven fraud. Fraudsters are smart &ndash; and will always devise schemes that allow them to penetrate company defenses. The question is &ndash; how quickly can you catch these individuals and mitigate against reputational risk, regulatory issues and financial loss.It&rsquo;s a very interesting problem and dilemma to contemplate. In the end, it is my opinion that when these market events occur, Compliance Officers have a limited window of opportunity to improve their company&rsquo;s defenses &ndash; and they should seize the opportunity!",

    "content": "<p> Working with teams for many years, I have learned that no two are alike and each one has its own personality and style. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the team chooses for its culture or style as long as it&rsquo;s high performing and resilient. Where the challenges come in is when a team isn&rsquo;t propelling forward or is stuck in second gear.</p><p> Some helpful questions that may realign a derailed team are:</p><p> Are we dealing with a process issue?</p><p> Do we have the right and diverse talent we need?</p><p> Do members have a clear understanding of their responsibilities?</p><p> Are we incorporating our vision and mission?</p><p> How are we encouraging idea sharing?</p><p> Questions are always a great way to begin a team discussion as long as the team leader is a skilled facilitator. People always know when their input is considered valuable versus when their suggestions are belittled or deemed lack luster.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Lead+by+asking+others+for+their+valuable+insights.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/06/15/five-strategies-to-pulling-a-team-together/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Lead by asking others for their valuable insights  </u>  . </a></p><p> <strong>  Here are five strategies to &ldquo;up&rdquo; your facilitation skills and pull a team together:  </strong></p><h3> 1. Have a Game Plan</h3><p> <br/> Before any change or forward motion can take place, it is key to choose a direction. It doesn&rsquo;t mean there is no room for additional tributaries to flow into the team river, it just means setting the course.</p><li> Include the team&rsquo;s or organizational vision in the plan</li><li> Clearly explain why this choice was made, including the benefits and disadvantages</li><li> Spell out each team member&rsquo;s responsibilities to themselves and each other</li><li> State this is the beginning of the plan&rsquo;s formation and the importance of the team refining their path <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Commit to Trying Something New</h3><p> <br/> This strategy can be the most difficult to embrace if we don&rsquo;t believe there may be a better way to achieve the team&rsquo;s goals. Try saying this to yourself before meeting with the team:</p><p> &ldquo;I am keeping an  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2014/05/19/why-curiosity-is-a-leadership-gift/#sthash.HO4mvdXV.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   open mind  </a> </u>  to new possibilities and will not put-down different perspectives that didn&rsquo;t work in the past.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;We really need to approach this challenge in a new way.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;This team is capable of innovation and creative problem solving.&rdquo;</p><h3>  3. Leave No Idea Behind </h3><p> <br/> According to Patrick Lencioni in his powerful book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership/dp/0787960756\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team&rdquo;  </a> </u> , commitment cannot come unless every suggestion is considered and mulled over. What this also implies is that a team leader needs to carefully facilitate the brainstorming piece.</p><li> Give each team member the opportunity to offer input by creating an environment of active listening without interruption</li><li> Validate each idea offered with a reason for its merit</li><li> Encourage team members to add to suggestions being shared with additional perspective</li><li> Maintain a supportive and kind atmosphere of acceptance, rather than judgment <br/>  </li><h3> 4. Include the Team in the Implementation </h3><p> <br/> Facilitating a team&rsquo;s new direction means never doing it alone in promoting the change. Each person should find their role and voice in launching the team forward. Decide together on individual expectations and put up the action plan on a whiteboard or Google drive for everyone to refer back to.</p><h3> 5. Follow Through with Gusto </h3><p> <br/> A good facilitator knows that keeping track of the team&rsquo;s progress is essential to any new choice or course. Set up  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2012/10/22/how-to-unlock-your-feedback-style/#sthash.NnIZQZnZ.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   feedback  </a> </u>  chains with specific timeframes and goals. Ask the team what is a reasonable date to achieve each of their contributions. Send out periodic check-in emails, offering to help with any bumps they may hit. Share with the team your challenges along the way too.</p><p> <strong>  What strategies have worked for you to pull a team together? </strong></p>",

    "title": "What Is Undue Influence and How Can It Lead to Financial Abuse?",
    "link": "what-is-undue-influence-and-how-can-it-lead-to-financial-abuse",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Have you ever heard the term &ldquo;undue influence&rdquo;? from time to time, Most people don&rsquo;t really understand what it means.  Is it just some weird legal thing? Or should you understand it? When it comes to seniors and financial abuse, the term becomes very important, because undue influence can readily lead to financial abuse. The legal concept of undue influence goes way back in history to the 1600s.  A lot of our law in the US is based on what our British ancestors did.  And sure enough there is an old case in which a woman pretended to love an older man and pressured or influenced him to give her all his money and property on his death. She didn&rsquo;t love him. She was married to someone else. The elderly man changed his will and left everything to her, and not to his own family.  His family sued, she lost and they got the estate he would have left to them if he hadn&rsquo;t been under the influence of this woman. And the English court found that she had used undue influence on him to get him to change his will.Centuries have passed but the same problem exists today.  People use their relationship with someone to get them to give money or property to the influencer.  We hear about it all the time at  <u>   AgingParents.com </u>  where we work with families helping them deal with issues about aging loved ones.  The struggle in families about control over an aging parent&rsquo;s finances often comes about because someone thinks another family member is using undue influence over a vulnerable elder.  And sometimes it&rsquo;s true!Laws about undue influence vary from state to state. Where I live in CA, we have a really good definition that helps people prove when someone was under undue influence of another person.  Keeping it simple and non-legal sounding this is the essence of the definition:</p><p> <strong>  Undue influence is excessive persuasion that causes another person to act or refrain from acting by overcoming that person&rsquo;s free will and results in something that isn&rsquo;t in the influenced person&rsquo;s best interests. </strong></p><p> A person who is elderly, frail, dependent on others for care or who is undergoing a lot of stress is particularly vulnerable.</p><p> The influencer is usually in a position of trust, like a family member or a position of authority over the one being influenced.  The person in authority could be a professional, such as a financial advisor or lawyer, or it could be a caregiver.</p><p> What are some of the classic warning signs of undue influence?</p><p> Here are five of them:</p><p> 1.   <strong>  The victim is vulnerable </strong> , such as shortly after a spouse has died or because he or she has dementia and can&rsquo;t make good decisions.  But a person can be vulnerable just because of being lonely too.</p><p> 2.  <strong>  The influencer assumes power, authority or control  </strong> over the one being influenced. This could come from the relationship, where the one being influenced thinks the influencer can be trusted and doesn&rsquo;t question them.</p><p> 3.  <strong>  Isolation of the senior </strong> , and doing things in secret, in a hurry or because the influencer tells the victim that everyone else is against her.</p><p> 4.  <strong>  Sudden changes in a long standing estate plan, including a will and or trust. </strong> The so-called &ldquo;natural heirs&rdquo; or family are cut out of what they were going to inherit and it goes to someone outside the family as a result of the senior being influenced to make those changes.</p><p> 5.  <strong>  Something happens that is not fair or reasonable for the victim. </strong> For example, another seizes control over their assets and they can no longer choose what to do with them. Or the elder&rsquo;s home is sold and he is forced to go to a nursing home against his will. These are examples of harm or an unfair result to the victim. </p><p> Undue influence is legally related to financial abuse.  Harm to the elder in some way is the result and it it always involves money, property or an agreement that affects the elder&rsquo;s welfare.</p><p> We hope you have a good idea now of undue influence.  If you see any of the warning signs happening to someone in your life, to a client, family member or friend, speak up!  </p><p> Seek legal advice from and elder law attorney or report the harm you see to Adult Protective Services. </p><p> Working together, we can all do something to stop elder abuse.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Quick, think back nine years ago to June 2006. Can you recall what was happening then?</p><p> Let me give you some hints. Shakira&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hips Don&rsquo;t Lie&rdquo; was blasting from radios, and moviegoers were lining up to see The Da Vinci Code. The U.S. was deeply involved in Iraq, where Saddam Hussein was being held and awaiting trial. And with Windows Vista still in beta testing, Bill Gates announced he would step down as chairman of Microsoft.</p><p> That June also marked the last time the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates.</p><p> So when will they be raised again? This Wednesday the world will tune in to see if Fed Chair Janet Yellen can answer that question. Though it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess what she&rsquo;ll say, there&rsquo;s no denying that many of the economic indicators the Fed is keeping an eye on have sharply improved lately.</p><p> This has huge implications for investors, a topic I touched on during my recent keynote address at the Canadian Investment Conference in Vancouver. You can watch a brief segment below. <br/> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/B-9frXHJIK8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-16-at-11.24.28-AM.png\" width=\"847\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><h3> More Jobs + Better Wages = Increased Spending</h3><p> <br/> The U.S. jobs market in May was strong on several fronts, indicating that the economy has indeed turned a new corner. Businesses added 280,000 jobs, beating estimates by more than 50,000, while jobless claims stayed below 300,000 for the fourteenth straight month.</p><p> Hourly wages rose 0.3 percent in May, 2.3 percent for the year. This is pulling people back into the labor force and has helped stabilize the still-low participation rate.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-US-Labor-Force-Participation-Rate-Finally-Stabalized_06122015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Labor Force Participation Rate Finally Stabalized\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-US-Labor-Force-Participation-Rate-Finally-Stabalized_06122015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> Among those finding work are young people, whose employment rate has risen over 10 percent in the last five years to add three million new workers. Investment banking and research firm Evercore ISI estimates that this trend will be sustained for the rest of the decade.</p><p> As the firm points out: &ldquo;This age group drives economic growth.&rdquo;</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-Young-Adult-Employment-up-10-over-the-past-65-months-06122015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Young Adult Employment up 10% over the Past 65 Months\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-Young-Adult-Employment-up-10-over-the-past-65-months-06122015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> All of this is good news for individuals and businesses alike. I said in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11360\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a recent Frank Talk  </a> </u>  that businesses should see job creation and wage increases as opportunities to build a new demographic of consumers and investors. We&rsquo;re seeing this unfold, as consumer spending is way up. Retail sales climbed 1.2 percent in May, while car and light truck sales grew 8 percent, leaving estimates in the dust. So far, 2015 is turning out to be a stellar year for automakers such as Ford, held in our  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11361\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   All American Equity Fund (GBTFX)  </u>  , </a>  as they aspire to reach the psychologically important 17 million units sold.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-US-Auto-and-Light-Truck-Sales-Accelerate-to-2007-High_06122015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Auto and Light Truck Sales Accelerate to 2007 High\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-US-Auto-and-Light-Truck-Sales-Accelerate-to-2007-High_06122015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> To meet supercharged auto demand, Ford plans to reduce the number of days its assembly plants are shut down this summer, from two weeks to one week.</p><h3> $5.6 Trillion in New Aircraft Orders over the Next Two Decades&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Airlines are also positioned to benefit handsomely from an improved U.S. economy. Last week, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that it expects the industry&rsquo;s net income to ascend to a record $29.3 billion this year, an increase of 80 percent from 2014. The group also projects that return on capital will exceed borrowing costs, an industry first.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-Surge-US-Economy-Expected-Help-Airlines-Achieve-Record-Income.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"The Surge in the U.S. Economy is expected to help airlines achieve record income this year\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-Surge-US-Economy-Expected-Help-Airlines-Achieve-Record-Income.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Airlines are so optimistic of sustained economic momentum that a staggering $5.6 trillion in new aircraft orders are expected to be placed over the course of the next 20 years. That&rsquo;s according to Boeing, which we hold in our  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11362\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Holmes Macro Trends Fund (MEGAX)  </u>  . </a>  In its latest outlook report, the aircraft manufacturer says that commercial jet fleets will more than double over this period, from 21,600 units to 43,560 units. Close to 60 percent of these new aircraft will be to accommodate growth in global air travel demand.</p><p> Check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.worldpropertyjournal.com/news-assets/Boeing-Global-Market-Forcast.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this infographic  </a> </u>  of Boeing&rsquo;s current market outlook, courtesy of World Property Journal.</p><h3> &hellip;And $6 Trillion in Business Deals over the Past 16 Months</h3><p> <br/> In the past 16 months, businesses have authorized over 1,000 deals&mdash;including mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), initial public offerings and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11363\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   stock buybacks  </a> </u> &mdash;for a total of $750 billion as of May. The biggest M&amp;As right now are chemical producer BASF&rsquo;s $35 billion bid to buy Syngenta&rsquo;s seed business, and the possible acquisition of T-Mobile by Dish for the same amount.</p><p> To fund these and other deals, businesses are increasingly turning to banks, which recently lent out $16 billion in a single week. This year, loan amounts are expected to surpass the previous record, suggesting that banks are gaining faith in borrowers&rsquo; ability to make payments.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-US-Bank-Loans-Return-to-Pre-Recession-Peak_06122015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Bank Loans Return to Pre-Recession Peak\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM-US-Bank-Loans-Return-to-Pre-Recession-Peak_06122015.gif\"/> </a></p><h3> Think Longer Is Always Better? Think Again</h3><p> <br/> Everything seems to point to a rate hike&mdash;if not this year, then within the next 12 months. The idea might worry some investors, but it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that rate normalization from current levels indicates that the economy is improving.</p><p> For municipal bond investors, this means staying with or moving into quality, shorter-term munis&mdash;the very kind our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11364\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Near-Term Tax Free Fund (NEARX)  </a> </u>  invests in&mdash;as their prices are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11365\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   less susceptible to rate fluctuations  </a> </u>  than longer-term bonds are.</p><p> As you can see below in the hypothetical example using a two-year, 10-year and 30-year Treasury, the further out the maturity date and higher the rate hike, the more your security would be affected. Again, these are Treasuries, not municipal bonds, but munis could be similarly affected.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM_The-Longer-the-Maturity-the-Greatr-the-Price-Volatility-06122015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"The Longer the Maturity, the Greater the PRice Volatility\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-12/COMM_The-Longer-the-Maturity-the-Greatr-the-Price-Volatility-06122015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> One last thing to be aware of: After a stellar performance in 2014, munis have traded sideways lately as investors await news from the Fed. The challenging nature of the bond market right now should not change your overall diversification strategy if it has always included fixed income.</p><p> And when rates do rise&mdash;whenever that might be&mdash;our team will be able to reinvest our maturing bonds in bonds that pay higher yields.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I recently invited several successful tech-entrepreneurs to a workshop to critique a business I&rsquo;ve been working with as an investor. The day was full of insightful feedback and heated discussion, as you&rsquo;d hope for when bringing together strong-minded business people with a record of success. One comment, made early in the day, stuck with me. <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deanmcevoy?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dean McEvoy  </a> </u>  is one of the Australian startup scene&rsquo;s success stories. He was a driving force behind the growth of the group buying industry in Australia and, more specifically, Spreets (spreets.com.au). His advice is relevant to anyone seeking not just financial success, but a deeper enjoyment of their business or career.His advice was simply; <strong>  find the reason why you are passionate about what you&rsquo;ve chosen to do, and make that reason something bigger than yourself. </strong> Case in point. At a cursory glance, Spreets might appear simply to sell goods and services to deal-loving consumers at volume discounts. However, that wasn&rsquo;t what inspired Dean to commit the time, money and faith into building a business that he later sold for $40m.The reason he found to be passionate about what he was doing was:  <strong>  to inspire people to try new and interesting things in their city. </strong> It&rsquo;s so simple, yet so compelling and easy to get behind. No doubt a reason why people loved and hugely supported what he was doing.So, what has this got to do with advice businesses? Well, I meet a lot of business owners who are not happy in their business. I meet a lot of employees that are demotivated, underutilized and occasionally deliberately counter-productive. The common thread in many cases is a focus on objectives that fall low on  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs\" target=\"_blank\">   Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy  </a> </u> ; pure profit, greater revenue, getting more clients in the door, working fewer hours or even the meaningless &ldquo;being the best&rdquo;.Targets are important. Without them, you&rsquo;re leaving much of success to chance. With them you can wilfully build a better business. However, what Dean highlighted to me is to build an extraordinary business (if that&rsquo;s what you want to do), and to generate the kind of team performance that most only read about in magazines, you need to find your reason.If you are in the business of advice, it could be a myriad of reasons bigger than simply &ldquo;build a profitable business&rdquo; or &ldquo;help people&rdquo;, such as:</p><li> Assemble a team of financial advice experts who understand what it takes to create the financial basis for a happy life, and equip them to turn that knowledge into outcomes for clients a hundred times over.</li><li> Help create happier relationships and closer families by removing the burden of financial stress and uncertainty from the lives of hundreds of Australians.</li><li> Ensure that the hard work of a generation provides the basis for an enduring legacy that benefits a family for generations to come.</li><li> Empower those who don&rsquo;t come from wealth to provide their children and their children&rsquo;s&lsquo; children advantages not bestowed upon them by society.</li><li> Support ambitious small business owners who support their local communities reverse the unacceptable trend of business failure.</li>Or it might be something completely different, unique to you.This all might at first seem hugely simplistic, possibly even &ldquo;fluffy&rdquo;, advice. As a natural born pragmatist, I often feel the same way when I read articles imploring us to &ldquo;believe in ourselves&rdquo; or &ldquo;dream the dream&rdquo; (drink the kool aid&hellip;). However, having sat in a room full of people who have achieved business success, watching them nod in agreement and express clearly and compellingly their own reasons, it&rsquo;s impossible to dismiss this out of hand.In an industry that continues to be weighed down with enforced complexity and uncertainty turmoil, maybe it&rsquo;s simple ideas like this that will enable more of us to reconnect with the enjoyment of a business or career with more purpose.",

Not sure about you, but if I&rsquo;m going to buy pretty much anything I go to Google and type some words in, refining my search.</p><h3> <a href=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-12-at-14-15-30.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-12 at 14.15.30\" src=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-12-at-14-15-30.png?w=300&amp;h=192\"/> </a> <br/> The C-Suite Still Make the Decision, Right?</h3><p> <br/> If you look at the research from Google, the C-Suite have Final Authority on 64% of decisions.

For example, there might be an overall Customer Experience Transformation project, but the individual software components that make that up, are purchased lower down the organisation.  Add to that in the new world of SaaS / Cloud, as software can be switched off as quickly as it&rsquo;s switched on and short timeframes of implementation, there may not be need for traditional IT involvement.</p><p> <a href=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-12-at-14-19-28.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-12 at 14.19.28\" src=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-12-at-14-19-28.png?w=300&amp;h=200\"/> </a> <br/> Based on Google&rsquo;s research the &ldquo;people in the know&rdquo;, 48% of them are 18- 34 and 24% are 35 &ndash; 44.

They are confident using mobile, in fact probably prefer it, when they do research on potential suppliers it is self-directed.  Google research also states that they are probably 57% of the way through a decision cycle before contacting suppliers.  Google also state that a researcher will do 12 searches until that point of engagement with a supplier.  Content that will be consumed includes video, blogs, customer comments etc.</p><p> Traffic to B2B websites has doubled in the last 2 years and this is because they have become a central point of research for potential customers.</p><h3> <a href=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-11-at-17-53-04.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-11 at 17.53.04\" src=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-11-at-17-53-04.png?w=660&amp;h=361\"/> </a> <br/> Zero Moment of Truth (ZMoT)</h3><p> <br/> If we go back to our own purchasing habits such as looking for a local plumber.  We might, search on the web, we also might seek references from friends, neighbours or relatives.  As we are all busy people, having a short list of more than 2 or maybe 3 is going to cause us a lot of work.  So while we might want to get &ldquo;several quotes&rdquo; that is a lot of time I need to invest, when I probably know which plumber I want to use from a short list of two.</p><p> Google found something similar for B2B purchases.  60% of customers only consider 2 brands, maybe your internal Purchasing department place on you the need to look at 3, for due diligence purposes.  Many organisations have an supplier option on a short list that nobody intends to use, just to make up the 3.</p><p> In Google&rsquo;s findings they found that people often search by Brand and not product or process.  Note to self:  It would be good to scoop these searches at the point of search on Google.</p><p> In 2011, Google came up with the term the Zero Moment of Truth (ZMoT).  In the past, when people purchased B2B products, they would go to the supplier and get all of the information from them, they would then make a purchase (First moment of Truth) and experience that product and service (Second Moment of Truth).  Now there is this new research phase, where people will do research on the product and service they intend to buy.  They will then move to purchase, having consumed content, blogs, video etc.  They may even have become pretty expert in the products or services they intend to buy.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll leave you with one last fact from Google&rsquo;s report &ndash; They reckon that in 75% of purchases a Millennial will make only one visit to your corporate website.  So you had better make it easy for them to use</p><p> There&rsquo;s a great two minute video on ZMoT from Google.</p>",

    "title": "Avoiding Women's Retirement Insecurity While Balancing Family & Career",
    "link": "avoiding-womens-retirement-insecurity-while-balancing-family-career-2",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Feelings of insecurity often pop-up women when the subject of women&rsquo;s retirement prospects come up. You are not alone.  The 2014 Aegon Retirement Readiness Survey, found this insecurity to be a global problem. Only 20% of women think they are on track to achieve their required retirement income and 40% state that they don&rsquo;t know. We offer some easy action steps to increase women&rsquo;s retirement preparedness.</p><h3> Why is women&rsquo;s retirement planning and saving hard?</h3><p> <br/> The path to retirement preparedness is cluttered with many obstacles. These often arise from a need to provide care for children, spouses or elderly relatives.  Women more often take career breaks and/or move toward part- time or contract working. Many employer sponsored plans do not extend retirement benefits to non-full time employees which consequently cuts out matching contributions and the higher savings rates they offered.</p><p> Women live longer and often marry spouses that are younger. If they happen to stay married this multiplies the longevity issue. Remaining single, partnered or divorced creates another set of unique challenges. For example, if your partner dies how will their economic contribution be replaced?</p><p> Often, women may believe that their spouse or partner is taking care of it. Expectations of pensions and savings and investment returns can create overly optimistic thoughts. It is natural on focusing on today&rsquo;s needs believing that long-term goals can be put off until later. Then suddenly later becomes today.</p><p> Women&rsquo;s lack of retirement preparedness contrasts sharply with otherwise confident and engaged behavior in deciding household budgets. The vast majority of women (80%) are actively involved in managing their households&rsquo; budgets and finances. Women attach a high priority to managing household finances, and this is an area where 71% feel financially confident. The need for working mothers to concentrate on short-term finances is clear.</p><p> Not surprisingly, women feel dependent on their spouse&rsquo;s income in later life. Over half (54%) of women who are married or living with a partners say that their spouse/partner will be &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; important as a source of financial support during retirement. Further, only 12% of women say that they do not expect their spouse to be an important source of retirement income. It should be noted that while a spouse/partner can provide a certain amount of support, a divorce or the loss of a partner can quickly and dramatically change a woman&rsquo;s financial situation.</p><h3> Turning anxiety into planning and action</h3><p> <br/> Women generally feel responsible for their own retirement income, are aware of the need to plan financially for their retirement and understand women&rsquo;s retirement planning matters. However, this does not often enough lead to action in the form of planning and saving. Only 10% of women say they feel &ldquo;very prepared&rdquo; for retirement and are confident they are already saving enough.  Over twice as many women (23%) say the opposite: that they feel &ldquo;much unprepared&rdquo; and are hardly saving at all.</p><h3> One simple step to improving women&rsquo;s retirement preparedness</h3><p> <br/> The most important factor in explaining the retirement preparedness of women is their attitude toward savings. Overall, just over one-third of women (36%) claim to be dedicated savers whose approach is always to make sure they are saving for retirement (which is not necessarily the same as &ldquo;saving enough&rdquo;). The priority must be to create a retirement planning model which fits around women&rsquo;s lives. This must recognize the dual role performed by women, who increasingly find themselves as both breadwinners and caregivers.</p><p> Clare an interviewee from The United Kingdom said:</p><p> &ldquo;It might help if I had some professional financial advice to help me plan more effectively.&rdquo;</p><p> We agree. One size fits all advice does not fit all women who may be single, married, divorced or partnered. Such a customized plan should preferably also provide for a back-up plan to cover for unforeseen events. If you aren&rsquo;t single Irma, an interviewee from Hungary said,  &ldquo;It is good to know that my spouse will contribute to our retirement financially, because it is much easier together. It is important for your partner to have standalone savings because anything can happen.&rdquo;</p><p> Why go it alone? Use the help of a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER to help with both a savings plan and an action plan. If your workplace offers one use it. If not, you can go to the Find a Planner search on the Letsmakeaplan.org website to find one in your area or Contact Us. Does your workplace offer advice from a CFP or advisor that is legally working in your best interest? A CFP&reg; will be able to help you determine how much you need to save, given your risk tolerance and expected retirement date (See SAT). More importantly, they can be a sounding board to learn about the particular goals and obstacles that are uniquely yours. This may include a customized plan to decrease debt, lower spending or using pay raises to fund retirement. That may include such things as disability, long term care insurance and insurance to replace the economic contribution of your spouse or partner</p><p> No time for the paperwork? You can ask them to help you with the paperwork at work or separately set-up an IRA if needed.</p><p> Increased financial literacy is always a solid investment in calming the nerves of financial uncertainty. Clients of Envision Wealth Planning receive a personal website that includes extensive videos and resources on retirement planning, college planning, estate planning, etc. It&rsquo;s also available on your smartphone. We recognize your life is hectic and want you to be able to access the information when it fits your schedule. This Life In a Box video will give you some quick insight into your personal financial planning organizer. Let us know if you would like a test drive.</p><p> I hope that this will help you find your path to retirement confidence.</p><p> The opinions voiced in this material are for general information only and are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations for any individual.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Certainly we all face challenges in life. But not all challenges are the same. What would you do if someone close to you, like a spouse or child committed suicide? Could you get over something like that? Would you die along with the person, condemned by that event, and forever defined by it? How would it impact your physical, mental, and spiritual health?</p><p> Not too long ago, Mellissa&mdash;British, born in Kentucky, but raising her family in Belgium&mdash;faced a devastating loss. Her husband and father of their three young children, publically committed a violent act of suicide.  I first learned of this when she contacted me on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fb.com/CoachMD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.fb.com/CoachMD  </a> </u>  very shortly after the event.</p><p> At the time of this blog, it has been about eighteen months since the event and I have remained in touch with Mellissa. She and her family is not only surviving, but thriving. I asked her to share the secrets to her ability to move on. The first six in the list below are some of the things she has done. The others I have added taken from my personal and professional experience and observations.</p><h3> 1. Get back to routine ASAP</h3><p> <br/> Her kids went back to school the very next day.  She went back to work a week later. They did sports, they did what they usually did, even attending children&rsquo;s birthday parties. Because you cannot change what has happened. Being in a routine helps pass the time, because time goes by very slowly...and you must have a routine to pass the time.</p><h3> 2. Surround yourself with support </h3><p> <br/> In other words, children, family, in laws, neighbors, colleagues, friends who can be there with you 24/7 when the shock of the situation comes flooding back.  She could literally call out of her bedroom window at 3am and her neighbor(s) would come running over.  Her colleagues waited for her every morning at 8am to have a coffee.  If she was not there by 8:30am they would phone and come looking for her. </p><h3> 3. Open discussion about what has happened with your children</h3><p> <br/> No, they are not too young and will respect you for being open with them and then in turn being open about their feelings. No sugar coating.  Open dialogue.</p><h3> 4. Start making a list of the good things you still have in your life</h3><p> <br/> Mellissa said this was the key for her. After all, isn&rsquo;t that the power of gratitude?  At first her list was just 1: her kids. But then 2 came: her health. But now...her list is over 30+.  She carries this list with her everywhere she goes.  She keeps it on her desk at work, and whenever she feels a bit &lsquo;wobbly&rsquo; she reads the list, and even adds some more.</p><h3> 5. Have a good therapist one who specializes in victims of suicide </h3><p> <br/> She had never know violence in her life, until her husband&rsquo;s suicide, so the violence of this mental illness and the publically violent action of killing himself was uncompressible to her. Talking to a psychiatrist trained in this area helped her to understand and come to terms with it.</p><h3> 6. Time</h3><p> <br/> Although the memory never fades, time does lessen its effect as long as you do the work.</p><h3> 7. Let go fully and completely</h3><p> <br/> This means letting go of any guilt, resentment, or anger&mdash;much easier said than done. The tendency is for you to feel as though you contributed to the person&rsquo;s death or that you could have done more to prevent it. But it happened and there is no going back. You may feel extreme anger or resentment. Yet, again, there is no going back. Unless you are to die along with the person, your only option is to stop replaying the past, let go, and move on.</p><h3> 8. Permit yourself to be happy again</h3><p> <br/> The fact is, when you begin enjoying anything in life, thoughts will creep in to try to steal your happiness&mdash;as though, &lsquo;how could you be happy?&rsquo; Your brain will try to pull you from being happy again, because it processes happiness has something causing vulnerability. Don&rsquo;t follow its lead but continue to follow the steps above. Make sure you say to yourself that there is &ldquo;no danger, there is no threat&rdquo; when you find yourself retreating from happy times.</p><p> Sometimes life deals us very serious blows, often blindsiding us. But these events need not destroy us. While we are alive, we owe it to ourselves to keep living. Mellissa has made a choice to do that and you can too. I&rsquo;m not saying it will be easy, but I am saying that you can make a choice to keep living, growing, and thriving even when faced with the most devastating life challenges.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Sometimes the best lessons we can learn about how to make our offices more inclusive of others, is to <strong>  look outside of the office </strong> . I think this point is especially true when we look at unconscious bias, and how easy it is to spot in society. It&rsquo;s so prominent, and yet, because it&rsquo;s so common, sometimes we miss it. We forget to look for the signs because it&rsquo;s simply how something has always been.  </p><p> Occasionally, an event occurs when unconscious bias&mdash;and the status quo&mdash;are called into question, and when that happens, we should listen. Such is the case of the McKinney Pool Party incident that took place in Texas recently. Jen&eacute;e Desmond-Harris&rsquo; article, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/the-only-good-news-about-the-mckinney-pool-party-is-the-white-kids%E2%80%99-response-to-racism/ar-BBkSwx0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The only good news about the McKinney pool party is the white kids&rsquo; response to racism  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; describes the seemingly unwarranted behavior of police officers toward black teens.</p><p> What&rsquo;s notable about the situation is the commentary from two white teenagers who witnessed the event. One teen, Brandon Brooks, 15, filmed the scene and uploaded the video to YouTube. In an interview with BuzzFeed, Brandon says: &ldquo;Everyone who was getting put on the ground was black, Mexican, Arabic. [The cop] didn't even look at me. It was kind of like I was invisible.&rdquo;</p><p> Another brave teen, Grace Stone, 14, said in an interview that she and her friends overheard the discussion between older, white adults that started the whole incident. Both Stone and Brooks took a stand in their interviews by pointing out their perceptions of just how wrong this treatment was.</p><p> An interesting phenomenon that can occur with unconscious bias, and which this situation illustrates, is the idea that <strong>  when a minority group cries out that they&rsquo;re experiencing discrimination or harassment, people don&rsquo;t seem to pay attention. However, when someone from the majority group points out discrimination/bias toward people in the minority group, everyone listens. </strong></p><p> This is exactly what happened in the event of this pool-party-gone-wrong. Had black individuals spoken out about this mistreatment, many might have looked the other way. But, because two white people&mdash;and white teenagers at that&mdash;pointed out the unfairness of the situation, everyone decided to listen.</p><p> But bias shouldn&rsquo;t prompt outrage simply because members of the majority group call foul! We need to all train ourselves to make sure that we&rsquo;re listening to all inputs and insights, regardless of where they come from and especially if they&rsquo;re coming from a minority group.  This is as true in the workplace as it is, in this case, at a pool.</p><p> This is a compelling wake-up call for all of us. Inclusive leaders need to be alert to the damage inherent in unconscious bias, as well as the tendency for all of us to fall prey to it. Keep in mind that <strong>  unconscious bias also isn&rsquo;t just an issue of race. Women in your office may feel that their input is valued less than men in meetings. Staff members with disabilities may feel marginalized. Employees from different generations may feel they are being treated differently than others. Introverts may feel they are being judged as inferior to, or less prepared than, their extroverted colleagues. </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re a male leader, you should take a female employee&rsquo;s concerns seriously, even if you don&rsquo;t see her point because you don&rsquo;t experience the bias shown to her. It&rsquo;s the same if you&rsquo;re a white supervisor listening to the concerns of a black employee&mdash;just because you don&rsquo;t experience the same biases this employee has, that doesn&rsquo;t mean his or her concerns aren&rsquo;t valid.</p><p> The road to becoming an inclusive leader starts here&mdash;be aware of unconscious bias. Be inclusive!</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Dear Boss,</h3><p> Hey, I hope you&rsquo;re having fun on vacation and this email reaches you on the sandy beaches of &ldquo;Riviera wherever you are that I couldn&rsquo;t afford.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t worry about responding to this, just wanted to send you an email to say we&rsquo;re having a minor issue. It&rsquo;s not really that important and can certainly wait but I like to send emails to people when it&rsquo;s hanging over my head so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it anymore. I know you like to do the same. Not that I want you to worry about it so don&rsquo;t read this and worry about it. Just because it&rsquo;s your company and the fate of our collective livelihood shouldn&rsquo;t mean that you should read this. I mean, come on! Have fun! But just know that we&rsquo;re having an issue back here that we can&rsquo;t resolve. Just wanted to let you know :)!</p><h3> Dear Employee,</h3><p> I hate you.</p><h3> Why Your Torture Plan Will Surely Backfire</h3><p> <br/> Thinking your boss isn&rsquo;t checking their messages while on vacation is as sound as your belief that you aren&rsquo;t annoying your boss with your emails. Bosses can&rsquo;t stop being the boss even if they want to. Your need to make sure your bases are covered or to cross something off of your to-do list without respect for someone else&rsquo;s R&amp;R only serves to piss off your boss (and really everyone else you do this to).</p><p> When our phone indicates we have a message waiting it sends a signal to one of the two most powerful parts of our brain: the reward center. That message says to the reward center, &ldquo;Yay, you have a friend, someone likes you!&rdquo; That message triggers the dopamine cycle, which releases dopamine, the feel good drug in the brain. Dopamine is also triggered when we eat a piece of chocolate cake, smoke a cigarette, drink alcohol or have sex. Not surprisingly, we are all dopamine addicts. Not obsessively checking your technology puts you through the same withdrawal, and requires the same amount of discipline as refraining from any pleasurable activity that triggers dopamine.</p><p> So what&rsquo;s the outcome of these annoying emails that you can&rsquo;t control yourself from sending? As humans, we like to hold onto annoyances over pleasantries, bad things over good things. Your boss will always remember you ruined their vacation, despite the million great things you do on a daily basis.</p><h3> Maybe Try This Instead?</h3><p> <br/> Fight the urge. Fight it hard. Unless it&rsquo;s an emergency put that annoying email on hold and save it for when your boss returns from vacation. You will prove to your boss that you can hold down the fort, and there&rsquo;s no better feeling for a boss than that. Your boss will return from vacation refreshed, and will like you more for not annoying them.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The decision to hire an SEO expert is the easy part, especially when your website is not bringing in the level of traffic you want or growing exponentially over time. Stagnation happens to the best of us, but usually occurs when a company is not progressive enough about adapting to changes in search algorithms and evolving trends. Frankly, keeping up with the times is a BIG job! That&rsquo;s why finding a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/hire/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   dedicated SEO consultant  </a> </u>  can be the biggest asset to your digital marketing team.</p><p> Yet, this industry in particular tends to attract a lot of fly-by-night type people who look for ways to deliver quick results, without doing a whole lot of work. Unlike other industries that have certifying bodies or industry standards, there is no such animal for SEO. It is up to &ldquo;buyer beware&rdquo; to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.affiliatemarketertraining.com/black-hat-seo-strategies-still-work-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recognize and avoid &ldquo;black hat tactics&rdquo;  </a> </u>  that hurt search engine placement and brand reputation in the long run. Once you understand what you don&rsquo;t want, here are a few qualities you should expect from a reputable SEO professional&hellip;</p><h3> Top 8 Traits to Look for When Hiring an SEO Specialist</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Experience</h3><p> &ldquo;Anyone can set-up an &lsquo;SEO agency&rsquo; overnight and call themselves an SEO expert,&rdquo; SEO Expert Jill Whalen told  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2400260/careers-staffing/top-10-things-to-look-for-in-an-seo-expert.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CIO Magazine  </a> </u> . &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they know what they&rsquo;re doing. There are hundreds of little things that go into the bigger picture of doing SEO and it takes many years of experiencing what works and what doesn&rsquo;t to truly do a good job.&rdquo; She explains that people who are new at SEO may try all the same tactics on every site until one of them is marginally successful, whereas the most seasoned SEO experts understand that each individual business requires a different set of SEO tactics to succeed and knows just where to funnel the most resources for maximum effect.</p><h3> 2. The Whole Enchilada</h3><p> Search engine optimization involve is more than coding a webpage. Fixing technical, structural issues is still important in removing road blocks for search spiders to crawl and index your content. However, the best SEO experts also have a comprehensive understanding of technical SEO,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/on-page-seo-checklist/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   on-page optimization  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/off-page-seo-checklist/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   off-page optimization  </a> </u> . As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2400260/careers-staffing/top-10-things-to-look-for-in-an-seo-expert.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Taylor Pratt  </a> </u> , VP of marketing for  <u>  <a href=\"http://8waysin8days.com/raventools\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Raven Tools  </a> </u>  says, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want a one-dimensional SEO. You need someone who will approach their strategy from all three angles to maximize success.&rdquo; In addition to three-dimensional SEO expertise, the best SEO professionals are the ones who have a thorough understanding of digital marketing and branding as a whole and how it relates to the end user. You can have numerous #1 rankings in Google, but if users don&rsquo;t resonate well with your website and content, those #1 rankings are worthless.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://ontargetwebsolutions.com/insights/seo-digital-human-experience-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   OnTarget.com  </a> </u>  has a great infographic on SEO and the human experience:</p><p> <img alt=\"SEO Human Experience infographic\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SEO-Human-Experience_infographic-674x1024.png\"/></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=85%25+of+clicks+in+Google+are+organic.+%23SEO+%23Infographic&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/top-8-traits-seo-specialist/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   85% of clicks in Google are organic. #SEO #Infographic  </a> </u></p><h3> 3. A Proven Track Record</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for references and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/search/case+study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   case studies  </a> </u>  to weed out the leaders from the pack. You want to see tangible results and improvements from your interaction with the SEO firm that justify the expense. It&rsquo;s easy for companies to present themselves in a professional manner and come off as having a good understanding of SEO. Yet, it&rsquo;s another thing to have a history of happy clients.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/testimonials/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Testimonials  </a> </u>  are good, but references who are willing to speak to you and vouch for the SEO expert&rsquo;s validity are better. Ask for three current clients you may contact for more information.</p><h3> 4. Content Expertise</h3><p> Modern SEO goes well beyond computer engineering degree work like link building and website tinkering to gain rankings. The phrase &ldquo;Content is king&rdquo; still reigns supreme as it helps businesses reach larger goals beyond simply hauling in web users in mass droves. What good are pairs of eyes on your copy if they&rsquo;re wholly uninterested in what you have to offer and leave your site seconds later, with no meaningful interaction? The best SEO professionals are able to write  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/content-marketing-services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   engaging and SEO-friendly content  </a> </u>  (or have reliable access to a pack of ravenous writers at their disposal). People are flooding the search engines not for a website, but for an answer &mdash; one that the SEO pro must know how to effectively promote and deliver! SEO is as much about marketing, social media, content, and psychology as it is about indexing, linking and pay-per-click ads. The more your SEO consultant understands about the different factors that come into play, the better your site will perform in terms of conversions, not just traffic.</p><p> Check out this helpful infographic on SEO-friendly blog posts from  <u>  <a href=\"http://envisionitagency.com/blog/2015/03/guide-to-seo-for-blog-posts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   EnvisionITAgency.com  </a> </u> :</p><p>  </p><p> <img alt=\"SEO-infographic-for-blog-posts\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SEO-infographic-for-blog-posts-791x1024.jpg\"/></p><p> Tip: We recommend creating blog posts that are 1,000 words or more</p><p> You might like:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-b2b-content-marketing-trends-consider/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8 B2B Content Marketing Trends to Consider  </a> </u></p><h3> 5. Strategic Thinking</h3><p> SEO is just one part of the digital marketing pie. The temptation may be to think, &ldquo;Well, if someone can do everything, then he or she must do nothing particularly well!&rdquo; However, that is simply not true in this industry. Conversely, you want someone who either has extensive knowledge in digital marketing as a whole &mdash; or someone who has assembled a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/meet-digital-marketing-consultants/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   team of professionals  </a> </u>  in all aspects of digital marketing, including content, social media, and paid advertising. A strategic thinker can look at your company goals for traffic, sales, brand reputation, target market, product development, competitive angling, and growth &mdash; and translate it to a series of moves that will get you where you need to be, starting with delivering prospects from the search engines to your websites.</p><h3> 6. Amiable Attitude</h3><p> The smartest search engine optimizers are not always the best fit. Frankly, some are downright arrogant and insensitive, while others seem harried, scatterbrained and poorly organized. Ultimately, what makes an SEO professional a good fit for your company is a  <u>  <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/02/21-ways-to-define-a-positive-attitude/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   positive attitude  </a> </u>  and favorable individual communication style. Your initial consultation should leave you with a good feeling and the sense that this person fits in with your corporate culture. SEO professionals will need to communicate their ideas clearly with IT personnel, the C-suite and your internal point-people to lobby for changes that need to be made and build consensus for the strategy moving forward. Good SEO firms keep you updated on the content calendar and all work being done, so you&rsquo;re never left in the lurch, wondering what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes or who this &ldquo;nut&rdquo; that you&rsquo;ve hired truly is.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Top+8+things+to+look+for+when+hiring+an+%23SEO+expert.+%238ways&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/top-8-traits-seo-specialist/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Top 8 things to look for when hiring an #SEO expert. #8ways  </u> </a></p><h3> 7. Passion</h3><p> There are many personality types in the SEO industry. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll find someone with the passion and drive to accomplish your company goals. You want someone with a real &ldquo;can-do&rdquo; attitude, who thrives on finding solutions to obstacles and roadblocks that may pop up along the way. It&rsquo;s relatively easy to find old grizzled veterans who have been in the industry for many years.

    "content": "<h3> Inspiring Change</h3><p> Henry David Thoreau&rsquo;s words serve as a strong reminder that only through changing ourselves do we change our circumstances. Just as leaders are not born, but are built by day-to-day behaviors, so are the changes in your organization. When you develop and encourage your employees, they become the change that you desire for your organization.  The attention you give, the support you provide, and the example that you set shines as a beacon, inspiring change, one person at a time.</p><p> So, how can you inspire others to change?</p><h3> Vision</h3><p> The Dalai Lama said, &ldquo;In order to carry a positive action we must develop here a positive vision.&rdquo; If you want to inspire in others the desire to change as individuals, in order to spur change in your organization, you must put forth a strong, vivid vision that they can buy into. Everyone needs a clear understanding of where the organization is headed and how their activities contribute. You must create a sense of inclusion where every employee understands the role they play in working towards a worthwhile, positive vision.</p><h3> Engagement</h3><p> Rupert Murdoch believes, &ldquo;In motivating people, you&rsquo;ve got to engage their minds and their hearts.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t bully or manipulate people into lasting change. They must follow you through thick and thin because they want to, because they are engaged, and they believe in you. Help your employees find their calling, engage them in using their talents for the good of the organization. Make their work meaningful. Build trust, help them develop their skills, and then give them control over their own work tasks. Help them succeed and then give credit for a job well done. When you invest in and engage employees, they become better and, as they become better, your organization becomes stronger.</p><h3> Opportunity</h3><p> Albert Einstein told us, &ldquo;All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual.&rdquo; Only when you give others the opportunity to develop and grow as individuals will they become more valuable. And, only through increasing the value of individuals, can you bring about true and lasting change. Give employees the opportunity to be involved. Encourage them to dig deeper and challenge the status quo. As a leader, give of your time, sharing your knowledge and experience with employees to help them to grow and become the best they can be.</p><h3> One Person at a Time</h3><p> Change is built and sustained through everyday action, one person at a time. When you invest in helping your employees become the best they can be, you will build a strong capacity for lasting change. Put forth a compelling, positive vision that each employee can be part of. Engage them in their work; provide them the skills and resources necessary and then give them control. Open the doors of opportunity so employees can continue to grow. If you want change, you must inspire it, one person at a time.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  When reviewing insurance needs - whether it&rsquo;s life insurance, disability, long-term care or even annuities - advisors need to consider possible costs in delaying a regular review of their client&rsquo;s products. </strong></p><p> There are two main costs of waiting that are commonly understood:</p><li> <p>  As clients get older, premiums go up. Waiting until a year or two to make the same change to insurance will result in higher premiums. While these costs will not increase astronomically, premiums are always a consideration. </p></li><li> <p>  Medical changes, however, can have an enormous impact. Waiting to review insurance could potentially result in going from being insurable to uninsurable. Even if your client remains insurable, they could experience a medical condition that changes them from a top-rated class to a standard class, resulting in significant differences in the price of insurance. No one thinks it&rsquo;s going to happen to them&hellip; until it does. </p></li><p> In addition to premiums and medical changes, there are other considerations advisors should be aware of.</p><p> The first is  <strong>  product changes </strong> . Remember that insurance companies are in the business of making money. The industry is very competitive, and companies use product changes to stay ahead of one another. The problem lies in products and features that are TOO competitive. For the carrier, this means that they are probably not making as much money on it, and for clients this means they will likely take it away.</p><p> Every year, new products get introduced to the market which are designed to be more profitable for the insurance companies. For example, in 2007, there were annuity products available with a guaranteed 7.2% interest rate for 10 years. Those products went away very, very quickly after the financial crisis.</p><p> Another example is guaranteed universal life insurance. These products offered low premiums, guaranteed for life, but with the low interest rate market and environment, insurance companies were not able to make much money with them. Those products are no longer offered as they were originally; now they are much more watered down and not quite as attractive. It took only a couple years for insurance companies to pull those products.</p><p> This doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything that is available today will be gone tomorrow, but understand that if there are opportunities and good products available now, they may not be available for long.</p><p> The second motivational tool for getting clients to review their insurance is  <strong>  irreparable damage </strong> . When products are purchased, and not purchased or structured in the right manner, as time goes by the available solutions become less. If someone buys a policy and problems are identified in the fifth year, there are many more options than there would be after 10 years.</p><p> By proactively looking at and reviewing insurance on an annual basis, advisors can find problems and present clients with multiple solutions rather than saying, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the only thing you can do&rdquo; - which a lot of times just means outlying a tremendous amount of money. </p><p> <strong>  What other costs have you found when waiting to review insurance needs? </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve always thought it would be helpful to read minds, then we&rsquo;d know.  We&rsquo;d know what people think and not have to worry about the whole assumptions-thing, and could actually deal with what is real.  But since people can&rsquo;t read our minds, we have to be mindful about sharing what&rsquo;s going on inside our brains and not assume that they know.</p><h3> Since people can&rsquo;t read our minds, we have to be mindful about sharing what&rsquo;s going on inside our brains and not assume that they know.</h3><p> <br/> A number of years ago I was working with a company in Chicago leading a series of sessions for a group of managers and all their direct reports.  During one of our conversations focused on recognition, a young guy, let&rsquo;s call him Jeff*, said &ldquo;You know Kimberly, I got a bonus last quarter and it really made me mad.&rdquo;  I could see the irritation written all over his face, but couldn&rsquo;t figure out why in the world someone would be upset about getting a bonus&hellip;  As he talked more, it all started to make sense.  You see this company had been going through some very difficult times.  Massive layoffs, a change in leadership, and a multitude of other issues had left the culture in tatters.  Their stock had tanked.  Morale was a mess.  Fear and mistrust were rampant.</p><p> Shaking his head in frustration, he said,  &ldquo;All year long I thought I was going to be the next person riffed. Over half our team got cut!  I kept working harder and harder, but my boss never said anything.  I had no idea that he was happy with my performance until the bonus showed up in my paycheck!  Why didn&rsquo;t he tell me he thought I was doing a good job?!  Going to work every day has been hell.  Eight months of sheer hell.  If I knew that he was happy with my work it would have made a huge difference.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to see how this can happen.  If we&rsquo;re to step into his manager&rsquo;s shoes (the middleman in a train-wreck-culture, who is trying to survive and prove himself like anyone else would be in that environment), we&rsquo;d probably be focused on the problems that need to be fixed.  We might think to ourselves, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to worry about Jeff, because Jeff is doing well.&rdquo; When bonus time rolled around it would make sense that Jeff would get one.  Jeff should know, we&rsquo;d think, that he&rsquo;s doing a good job.  He&rsquo;s still here after all!</p><p> Recognition is one of those things that many leaders consider a nice-to-have.  It often gets a bad wrap with folks who think that it&rsquo;s all about the numbers and that people with a true high-performance-mindset shouldn&rsquo;t need it.  But unless these folks are working with computers instead of human beings, they&rsquo;re sorely mistaken.  Human beings at work need recognition as much as they need a paycheck.  </p><p> Human beings at work need recognition as much as they need a paycheck.  </p><h3> Let&rsquo;s map this to Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs:</h3><p> <a href=\"https://onstageleadership.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/maslow-w-caption.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://onstageleadership.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/maslow-w-caption.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> In a culture where there&rsquo;s as much turmoil as the one I described &ndash; in which there are rampant layoffs &ndash; people don&rsquo;t feel safe - which makes up the foundation of our human needs.  When their work group is being decimated and they&rsquo;re not getting feedback from their boss, they don&rsquo;t feel like they belong, can&rsquo;t determine whether they&rsquo;re achieving, or what their boss thinks about them in terms of reputation.  And what we know from Maslow&rsquo;s work is that if the more foundational needs aren&rsquo;t met, then the higher-level needs like growth and fulfillment aren&rsquo;t even a possibility.</p><h3> If our more foundational needs aren&rsquo;t met, then the higher-level needs like growth and fulfillment aren&rsquo;t even a possibility.</h3><p> <br/> No one can be their best or do their best work in that environment.  If you have a high performer who is still hitting their metrics in the face of these crushing odds, imagine what s/he could do with a little recognition?</p><p> Simple acts of recognition would restore their sense of safety, of belonging, let them know they&rsquo;re on the right track in terms of achievement, that their reputation is in-tact, and allow them to focus on things that are adding more value to the company while experiencing a sense of growth and fulfillment.</p><p> Look, I know we&rsquo;re all doing the best that we can.  Most of us are carrying immense responsibilities and are giving a Herculean effort to get more done in a day than one person should ever have to do.  You are extraordinary.  And there are a whole lotta people in your life &ndash; at work, at home, in your community &ndash; who are also extraordinary &ndash; who need to be seen for the value they bring.  Don&rsquo;t assume they know.  Tell them.</p><p> &ldquo;What you do matters.  This is why it matters to me&hellip;.  Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p> Don&rsquo;t assume people know the value they bring.  Tell them.</p><p> You are far more powerful than you know.  It&rsquo;s amazing the difference a sincere &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; can make. If you think someone is doing a good job, don&rsquo;t make them read your mind.</p><p> *All names have been changed to protect those who should&rsquo;ve been recognized by more than a bonus check.</p> ",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;What makes you different?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Why should I choose your company over [insert competition]?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> These are the most common questions that are asked by prospective clients and tend to be the most difficult to answer. These questions shouldn&rsquo;t confound you, nor should they be answered with ambiguity or industry similarity. The question of differentiation is a challenge for any business and industry, but I think it is especially challenging for the professional services industries of finance, real estate and law.</p><p> If you find yourself in one of these camps, you are many in number. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are roughly 225,000 financial advisors; 1,275,400 accountants; 422,000 real estate agents and brokers; and 760,000 attorneys in the country. Just to put these numbers into perspective, there are 216,000 marketers and advertisers; 55,000 interior designers; 107,000 architects; and 147,000 dentists. You&rsquo;re swimming in an ocean if you&rsquo;re in finance, real estate or law and trying to overcome &ldquo;small fish&rdquo; syndrome isn&rsquo;t easy, understandably so when you see the numbers of people sharing your profession.</p><p> Here are ten easy ways to get clear on what makes you and your business different so that you can cut through the crowd and stand out uniquely all your own. These are the questions you must answer first so that you can answer the ultimate question of differentiation.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s first start with you and your personal brand. You are in the relationship business, so you yourself are both product and service.</p><h3> Personal Brand <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. What made your last client decide to go with you?</h3><p> <br/> Ask them. Really. And keep asking this question of every client you sign.</p><h3> 2. What do your clients like most about you?</h3><p> <br/> Phrase it however you like, but this is a question you should be asking after you&rsquo;ve worked together for some length of time.</p><h3> 3. How have you helped a client today/ What problem did you solve?</h3><p> <br/> Maybe you won a case, made a smart investment that performed well, or got your client&rsquo;s offer accepted&hellip; or maybe you answered a question they had or revised their tax estimate at no charge. Whatever it is that you do, big and small, to add value to your clients&rsquo; lives is important to note. What you do is more important than what you say.</p><h3> 4. What is it like to work with you?</h3><p> <br/> This question can go along with question #2 and only your client can answer this question. You can definitely not answer this question. You want to make sure you&rsquo;re providing great service, but don&rsquo;t lead your client&rsquo;s answer. Let them answer any way they like and listen carefully.</p><h3> 5. What else do you do for your clients, above &amp; beyond your standard services?</h3><p> <br/> Maybe you do nothing extra, but something tells me you probably are going above and beyond in some ways. Perhaps you share tickets to a concert with them or host an educational or social event. Some of you may act as quarterback with their other trusted advisors or connect them with resources after their engagement with you.</p><p> <strong>  Next, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at your business brand. You either own your own practice or you operate under the umbrella of a firm or broker. </strong></p><h3> Business Brand</h3><h3> <br/> 6. What do your clients say about your business?</h3><p> <br/> What is their perception of the larger business entity? Ask them and deploy some social listening tools if necessary. It&rsquo;s very important to know what your clients are saying about the brand when you&rsquo;re not in the room. If your firm has marketing resources, see if they can help you this this question with data and insights.</p><h3> 7. What are your clients&rsquo; favorite or least favorite part about being a client?</h3><p> <br/> You have to ask them to know this answer. try not to focus too heavily on the outliers: people that are either over the moon or hating your business. Focus more on the people in the middle who largely go unnoticed and unasked. I think it is wise for firms to develop a way to collect these answers on a yearly basis. When you know what clients like most about your brand, you can make sure you preserve that key element of your business that makes you different, and it may not be what you think!</p><h3> 8. What is most valuable to your clients and how do you deliver that to them?</h3><p> <br/> Do you know what your clients value most? And do not say, &ldquo;peace of mind.&rdquo; As a financial advisor, you may think they care about saving for retirement the most (your words), but maybe what they really care about is smarter spending so that they don&rsquo;t run out of money in retirement.  That is a different story than the one you may be telling and could differentiate you from all the retirement planning folks in town chirping about savings, savings, savings.</p><h3> 9. What is one thing your business does that your competitors don&rsquo;t?</h3><p> <br/> Do you know your competition? Visit their websites, call them on the phone and pose as a potential client. Ask some questions and learn about them the way your potential clients do. Find out what they say makes them different so you can better communicate what makes your company different.</p><h3> 10. Who do you serve?</h3><p> <br/> Who you serve can be a huge differentiator for your practice, especially if you have a niche. In the professional services industries you likely have more than one target audience. That being said, you need to be specific about which target audiences you serve. Otherwise, you sound like everyone else by just talking about what you do versus talking directly to your ideal client. Financial services tends to identify who they serve by financial minimums; that is not a target market, that is a minimum requirement that helps you qualify. Real estate segments by type of buyer: first time homebuyer, short sale and specialties. This is good, except nothing stands out. Law is similar to real estate in that it also segments by type of client legal issue and specialties. Your clients are the heroes of your story. Are you zeroing in on your ideal client or casting that wide net?</p><h3> Conclusion:</h3><p> <br/> Perhaps you have already observed a key element of the questions I have listed above. 60% of the questions posed above can&rsquo;t be answered by you. And the other questions require a little more thought and research. If you really want to know what makes you different, start with your clients. Their choice of financial advisor, real estate agent or attorney is highly personal. For that reason alone, you can&rsquo;t speculate these questions in-house and you may find that personality, tone, and culture are also determining factors.</p><p> As a professional service, SERVICE may be exactly what differentiates you the most. Not just what services you offer, but how you serve and who you serve.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Challenge: What is your process when you meet with a new ideal prospect or client?  <br/>  <br/>  Opportunity: Have a process to build trust through key questions and become a trusted advisor to high net worth clients </strong> <br/> <br/> We understand that your clients trust you. The question is how much do they trust you? On a scale from 1 to 100, what percent would you say your top clients trust you? How do you know if it is 100%? Bill Bachrach (Bachrach and Associates www.billbachrach.com) once said&rdquo; truth is that most financial professionals have little or no idea why their clients trust them or how to replicate high-trust client relationships. Trust is not something that should happen by accident. We understand that your clients trust you. The question is how much do they trust you&rdquo;? How do you get your clients trust meter to 100% and gain all of their business and referrals? <br/> <br/> How do you build trust? Besides gathering all the necessary information on paper on your client, what are the key questions to ask to build trust and understanding of the client&rsquo;s point of view. When you have the biggest potential prospect walk through your door with millions of assets to invest with you, what&rsquo;s the first thing that goes through your mind? &ldquo;Oh my gosh, what am I going to do or say to impress this person, what am I going to do differently to attract this client?&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Do you have a consistent framework or key process for each interview structured in such a way as to build trust and gather all of the relevant information to help this person? Years ago as an advisor I was taught to probe for hot buttons and ask all kinds of questions. Then one day I came across a book by Bill Bachrach called Values-Based Selling: The Art of Building High-Trust Client Relationships (Bachrach &amp; Associates Inc., 1996). <br/> <br/> Soon after I read the book I contacted Bill and his team about their processes. Since practice management is all about processes, I wanted to find out about how they do it. This lead into reading his next book&rdquo; Values-Based Financial Planning: The Art of Creating and Inspiring Financial Strategy by Aim High Publishing (July 2000) <br/> As Bill says about his process with clients and prospects&rdquo; In the grand scheme of things, money's not that important. It's important only to the extent that it allows you to enjoy what's important to you. And not worrying about your finances is critical to having a life that excites you, nurtures those you love, and fulfills your highest aspirations. If you want to make smart choices about money, based on what is important to you--your core values, this book is for you. <br/> <br/> Do your clients trust you enough to pay you a separate, up-front fee for planning and advice? Or do you under-charge or give away planning or portfolio reviews in the hopes of getting their assets or selling an annuity or insurance policy? <br/> <br/> Do they trust you enough to consolidate all of their assets with you and your custodian? Or do they have their money spread among multiple advisors and institutions? (This is NOT diversification!) <br/> Do they trust you enough to ignore the noise in the media and the talking heads on TV about the economy, the markets, politics, and chaos around the world? <br/> &ldquo;Everyone has an imaginary &lsquo;trust dial&rsquo; embedded in their subconscious and everything you say and do moves the needle on that trust dial&hellip; one direction or the other.&rdquo; Bill Bachrach. It&rsquo;s in the best interest of both the advisor and the client for the needle to move from the middle to the maximum. The question is, &ldquo;how do you do that?&rdquo; <br/> <br/> <strong>  How do you speak the language of trust? Bill believes it boils down to three things: </strong> <br/> <br/> 1. Know the right questions to ask, when to ask them and how to ask them. <br/> 2. Listen with empathy. <br/> 3. When it's your turn to talk to be able to make an offer or give advice that is relevant for them, with confidence and conviction, and in a way that tends to inspire action. <br/> <br/> Building a system of trust is a process. Do you go deep enough in the questions you ask? Deep enough emotionally? To do this, you ask clarifying and expanding questions in response to the answers you get from your initial meaningful, important, significant and compelling questions. An effective clarifying question is, \"What do you mean by __________?\" An effective expanding question is, \"Tell me more about _______________.\" Clarifying questions provide more detail about their answers. Expanding questions give you more information about their answers. <br/> <br/> As Bill Bachrach says&rdquo; Impact questions are some of my favorite questions. They take what you have discovered during a conversation that's gone emotionally deep from someplace meaningful and bring it to a crescendo about the impact and results this will have on a client's life. Impact questions are questions like, \"And what impact will that have on your life?\" \"Once you have achieved ____________, what will be the result of that?\" <br/> <br/> You have asked good questions, gone emotionally deep with clarifying, expanding and impact questions, and listened with empathy, so what do you do now? It's your turn to talk. And what will be music to their ears when you do speak is if you make them an offer or give them advice that is relevant for them. How do you know what's relevant for them? That's what you discovered while you were listening to the answers to all of your excellent questions&rdquo;. <br/> <br/> One final question. Do you have a trust building process when you meet with a new ideal prospect or client?</p>",

    "link": "social-security-its-a-womens-issue",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s true: everyone should be taking steps to maximize their social security benefits. The findings of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College study estimating that more than $10 Billion in benefits are left on the table each year make this more clear than ever. And while this raises big questions about what can be done to get benefits into the hands of today&rsquo;s retirees, the concern about unclaimed benefits is even greater for women&mdash;many of whom could use an extra boost in Social Security income.  <br/> <br/> If you are a woman approaching retirement&mdash;whether you are single, married, divorced or widowed&mdash;it&rsquo;s critical that you review every option to be sure you&rsquo;re getting the most you can from Social Security. It may be the most important financial decision you make in planning for retirement. </p><h3> Why is maximizing Social Security benefits a women&rsquo;s issue? The statistics speak for themselves:</h3><li> Women earn less.  <u>  Women working full-time continue to earn just 77% of what their male counterparts earn </u> &mdash;a number that corresponds to an equal reduction in individual Social Security benefits. </li><li> Women have lower Social Security benefits.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/resource/women-and-social-security\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   On average, the Social Security benefit for women 65 and older is just over $13,000 per year, compared to $17,000 for men of the same age  </a> </u> .</li><li> Women rely more on Social Security. 30% of women 65 and older rely on Social Security for more than 90% of their income, compared to 23% of men of the same age. For unmarried women, including those who are widowed, divorced, or have never married, this number jumps to 36%.</li><li> Women leave the workforce more often to serve as caretakers.  <u>  <a href=\"https://caregiver.org/women-and-caregiving-facts-and-figures\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   As many as 75% of family caregivers are women  </a> </u> , making this group particularly susceptible to loss of income and lower personal benefits from Social Security.</li><li> Women live longer. A longer life expectancy requires an increase in retirement income to support additional costs for housing, medical, and long-term care expenses. </li><p> <br/> While there&rsquo;s no changing these numbers in the near term, the good news is that there are specific strategies that can help you boost your Social Security income considerably over the long term.  <a href=\"http://www.prudential.com/media/managed/wm/media/Pru_Women_Study_2014.pdf?src=Newsroom&amp;pg=WomenStudy2014\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yet a recent study from Prudentia </a> l found that only 33% of women seek professional financial advice&mdash;including advice for maximizing Social Security benefits. Isn&rsquo;t it time to change that fact and bring home the highest possible income during what may be the most financially challenging years of your life? <br/> <br/> While the ideal strategy is as individual as every woman, here are a few tips to get started on a path to a more comfortable retirement:</p><h3> Single Women: It&rsquo;s all about longevity</h3><p> If you&rsquo;re single, outliving your money may be your biggest retirement fear&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;ve never been married and must rely on your own savings and Social Security benefits. Despite the common misconception that living expenses will decrease with age, expenses generally rise as you get older due to the cost for long-term care and medical care associated with longevity, not to mention the rising cost of living that comes with inevitable inflation. To help combat these challenges, consider these options:</p><li> Delay distribution to boost benefits. While the majority of women claim benefits at the earliest possible date at age 62, waiting to file until age 70 can increase your annual benefits by as much as 76%. This jump includes an 8% annual increase, from ages 66-70, provided by Delayed Retirement Credits (DRCs). Benefits may also increase due to annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLA). </li><li> Turn to other savings first. Delay claiming Social Security benefits by drawing down on your other investments, such as a 401(k) or IRA. Unless these other funds are earning more than an 8% guaranteed annual return&mdash;the equivalent of the DRC&mdash;there&rsquo;s no reason to file before your benefits hit their maximum at age 70. <br/>  </li><h3> Married Women: Coordination is key</h3><p> When it comes to money, men have a tendency to focus on lump-sum payouts, whereas women focus more heavily on cash flow. This difference can prove to be critical when looking at Social Security benefits, since the goal is to ensure the highest possible monthly income throughout retirement. If you&rsquo;re married, distribution timing is still important, but you can also gain significant additional income from your spouse&rsquo;s Social Security benefits if you carefully coordinate your claims using these combined strategies: </p><li> Suspend benefits to collect spousal benefits first. Using a strategy called &ldquo;File and Suspend,&rdquo; your husband (assuming he is, in fact, the higher earner) can file for social security at 66 (full retirement age or FRA), butsuspend distribution of benefits to receive the 8% per year DRC up to age 70. Now that he has technically &ldquo;filed for benefits&rdquo; (even though they are suspended), you may begin receiving spousal benefits which total 50% (at FRA) of the your spouse&rsquo;s total FRA benefit amount. </li><li> Restrict benefits for the higher earning spouse. Using a strategy called &ldquo;File and Restrict,&rdquo; both you and your spouse are able to receive a benefit while one benefit amount continues to grow due to DRCs.  Using this strategy, you file for and receive your own benefit, while your spouse (again, assuming he has the higher benefit) restricts his benefit to a spousal benefit amount and defers his own benefit to age 70. This allows him to take advantage of the DRCs as well as any increases due to COLA on the higher benefit amount.</li><li> Take advantage of survivor benefits. If your spouse defers his benefit to age 70, not only is his benefit amount increased by 32% plus COLA, but his higher total benefit amount also represents your &ldquo;survivor benefit&rdquo; should he predecease you. Your survivor benefit is equal to 100% of his now higher benefit. If you pre-decease your husband, he will continue to receive his higher benefit amount throughout retirement. <br/>  </li><h3> Divorced and Widowed Women: The secret is in the sequence.</h3><p> If you&rsquo;re divorced, you typically can&rsquo;t count on the financial resources of a spouse. However, when it comes to Social Security benefits, you have more options than you may think:</p><li> Claim spousal benefits on an ex-spouse&rsquo;s earnings. If you&rsquo;re divorced but were married for at least 10 years and divorced for at least two years, you may be eligible to claim spousal benefits on your ex&rsquo;s earnings&mdash;but only if you aren&rsquo;t remarried. If you were married again, but your later marriage ended in the divorce or death of your new husband, you have the option of claiming spousal benefits from the highest earning ex. (Of course, you can only claim benefits on the earnings of one former spouse at a time!) </li><li> Re-married after 60? Collect survivor benefits. If you remarry after age 60 and your ex-husband dies, you have the option to claim survivor benefits on the earnings of your ex-husband, equal to 100% of his benefit amount.  <br/>  </li><h3> Women Need to Take Charge In Planning for Benefits.</h3><p> If you were out of the workforce for any period of time&mdash;to stay at home, assist a family member as a caregiver, or for any other reason&mdash;achieving an employment record of at least 10 years (40 quarters) is vital to be eligible for any individual benefits. It can sometimes be well worth the effort to take a full- or part-time job to complete the 10-year minimum. Also, note that even if you begin to collect benefits at 66, you may still be able to increase your benefit amount because it is based on the highest 35 years of averaged indexed monthly earnings, even if those earnings occur while you are receiving benefits.  <br/> <br/> Regardless of your marital status, as a woman, you likely face a longer lifespan and lower earnings than a man&mdash;both of which make maximizing your Social Security benefits particularly important. If you have not yet filed a claim for benefits, consider these strategies as a starting point, and talk to a qualified Social Security advisor to be sure you&rsquo;re doing all you can to ensure a more comfortable and secure retirement.</p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the biggest mistakes that I see made by well-meaning folks in an effort to shift organizational thinking toward a greater focus on customers is the inability to distinguish between  <strong>  customer service </strong>  and  <strong>  customer experience </strong> . <br/> <br/> \"There's a difference?\" You ask. <br/> <br/> Yup! And it's a big one. One that is well worth noting, remembering, and evangelizing. <br/> <br/> Why? <br/> <br/> When we use these two terms interchangeably, we cause confusion. We confuse employees, and we confuse the marketplace. It's important to know that they are not one and the same. <br/> <br/> I spend a lot of time talking to prospects and clients about how to sell the value of focusing on delivering a great customer experience  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/09/help-my-execs-dont-get-it.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   to their company leaders  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s so disheartening because it seems so obvious. Instead, I hear a lot of misplaced ideas and excuses; one that I hear often is: \"But we have a customer service department. We spend time and energy making sure we get customer service right.\" <br/> <br/> I also see job postings where titles erroneously refer to the position as a \"customer experience\" role. First we fight to get recognition for the CX  profession , and then everyone jumps on the bandwagon, making it trendy to put \"customer experience\" in every title, e.g., calling a call center agent or a retail sales associate a \"customer experience representative.\" Again, more confusion. <br/> <br/> They're not the same thing. <br/> <br/> What, then, is  <strong>  customer experience </strong> ? In its simplest definition, it is (a) the sum of all the interactions that a customer has with a company over the course of the relationship lifecycle and (b) the customer's feelings, emotions, and perceptions of the brand over the course of those interactions. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Customer service </strong> ? It's just one of those interactions or a type of interaction. It is just one touchpoint along the customer's journey with your organization. As Chris Zane says:  Customer service is what happens when the customer experience breaks down. I love that definition and way of distinguishing the two. <br/> <br/> Think about this: If you got everything else right, perhaps the customer wouldn't need to call customer service. The experience (the \"everything else\" plus service) starts long before the service event. Keep in mind, too, that not every customer experience even includes a service event. <br/> <br/> Another way to look at the difference? Customer experience is proactive, while customer service is reactive. Customer experience is proactive because we intentionally build or design the experience that we want our customers to have - and that they want to have. (Hopefully that means it's based on customer understanding - we understand who they are and what they are trying to achieve, which guides CX design.) Customer service is reactive in the sense that we're constantly responding to issues and needs as they arise. It's a bit like Whack-a-Mole, while customer experience is more like Monopoly. A sprint vs. a marathon. A point in time vs. a lifetime. <br/> <br/> Another approach: customer experience is what the  customer feels ; customer service is what the  company does  (for the customer). <br/> <br/> And one more: customer service is a department, while customer experience is not; it's a discipline.  <br/>    <br/> And finally, another consideration: think about the difference as a journey vs. a touchpoint. Customer experience is the journey; customer service is a touchpoint. Why is this viewpoint important? When we focus on the entire journey, not solely on individual touchpoints, we deliver a much better experience overall for the customer - and, as a result, for the business. When you just consider touchpoints and single moments of truth, you're focusing on transactional relationships, not on trusted, long-lasting relationships. <br/> <br/> Still not sure? How else can you tell the difference? <br/> <br/> Map the customer journey - from the customer's perspective - and plot all the ways in which the customer touches or interacts with your organization. Yea, the touchpoints. They are  parts  of the experience - a point in time - but they alone are not the  sum total  experience - a lifetime. <br/> <br/> Have you had to make this distinction to your co-workers, executives, or clients? How did you describe it? How do we get organizations to think about these two concepts in a different way? <br/> <br/> If we are not customer driven, our cars won&rsquo;t be either . -Donald Peterson, former CEO, Ford Motor Company</p>",

Banks will still make loans and give away toasters and try to sign you up for various financial products you don't need. But they won't be controlling transactions.</p><p> Right now, things like Apple Pay (and its imitators) are sitting clumsily in the middle of a cumbersome old-school transaction infrastructure, with banks and credit-card companies acting as the gatekeepers. But that's temporary. The endgame will be one in which peer-to-peer transactions, using  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29\" target=\"_blank\">   blockchain  </a> </u>  technology for trust propagation, will obviate the need for external gatekeepers.</p><h3> Your Apple Watch is your wallet.</h3><p> <br/> Once every month or so, you'll stash a cache of iCash in your wallet.

    "content": "<p> When I spend time with registered reps it&rsquo;s not uncommon to hear the lackluster response they have when the topic of compliance is brought up. Heavy Sigh&hellip;. Come on &ndash; it&rsquo;s not THAT bad&hellip;.right? Unfortunately, it can be for some, but for a variety of reasons on  both sides  of the subject. Let&rsquo;s discuss.</p><h3> Advisors &ndash; what can you do to be more compliant? </h3><p> <br/> The answer, in a nutshell, is:  A LOT. Compliance is a very serious topic whether you are a registered rep or not.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannabelbey/2015/06/03/finras-top-regulatory-priorities-for-financial-services-industry/?utm_source=followingweekly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20150608\" target=\"_blank\">   Joanne Belbey of Actiance recently wrote an article in Forbes magazine  </a> </u>  that discussed certain areas that advisors need to better understand the compliance needs associated with:</p><li> <p>  <strong>   Senior Markets:  </strong>    Beware and Be Aware! We&rsquo;ve all heard about this in our industry news, </p></li><li> <p>  but we just need to beware in general when working with the senior market and be aware of ways you can be more compliant. Period. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Cybersecurity and High Standards:   </strong>   I love the insight provided by Belbey when she quoted Susan Axelrod of FINRA which was, </p></li><p> &ldquo;&hellip;you should hold your third party vendors to your own high standards, or you will open your firm to venerability.&rdquo; Amen to this statement! We all need to be thinking this way!</p><li> <p>  <strong>   Best Practices:  </strong>    Your client&rsquo;s data IS your most important priority each day. Be sure only the right people are accessing data on an as-needed basis. Your clients will not only appreciate you more, but trust you. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Lead by Example:   </strong>   Setting a precedence of compliance in your office makes everyone feel it&rsquo;s an important topic. In my world of social media, for example, be sure that all registered reps are doing what compliance has asked and all questions about certain requirements are discussed as a group. One person may be reading a guideline one way while another interprets it completely different. </p></li><h3> Compliance &ndash; what can you do to help advisors? <br/>  </h3><li> <p>  <strong>   Listen to the full question.  </strong>    Advisors are lost in the language of compliance. Be patient with their questions and use layman terms and examples when they want a better understanding of why you want something a certain way. I don&rsquo;t think advisors (as a majority) want to be non-compliant. They want to understand &ldquo;why&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m finding that the proverbial answer of </p></li><p> &ldquo;&hellip;because I said so&rdquo; is not well-received.</p><li> <p>  <strong>   Review guidelines more often.  </strong>    Social networking platforms change&hellip;and they change a lot (it&rsquo;s the bain of my existence!) Be open to the possibility that certain platforms allow an advisor greater exposure (in a good way &ndash; don&rsquo;t go right into the negative risk aspect) to potential clients. Too many other industries are leaps and bounds ahead of those who are trying to make a difference and bring peace of mind through financial planning. Be sure you are giving them a chance to shine in their community. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Be expeditious in your reviews.  </strong>    If you take too long to review profiles or articles, the advisor loses trust in the compliance process. Have an expeditious review process that takes into consideration that you&rsquo;ve given the advisor the platform ability to use, they are likely paying for it through dashboards that monitor, so please be respectful in the review process. I believe this process has come a LONG way from where it once was, but I am still seeing some reviews take two to four weeks. Whether you want to hear this or not, that&rsquo;s not acceptable. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Accept mediation.  </strong>   There are social media consultants out there (yes, like me) who are wonderful advocates (like an ad litem) who want the best for both:  advisors and compliance. Allow these specialized individuals to help mediate the process to cut back on the frustration for both parties and assist in making sure the lines of communication are open and clearly understood. </p></li><p> Compliance is a necessary part of working well and being mindful of consumers and advisors best interests. I&rsquo;m definitely not a compliance poo-pooer by any means. I believe there is still a breakdown between the two worlds though and if I can do anything to help, please let me know.</p><p> Be Bigger, Better, and more BIONIC!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> My whole life I have wanted to own a dog, but my busy work schedule kept me from considering owning one. Then, three years ago, after much thought and soul-searching, I realized that by adopting a dog I would get daily, healthy exercise and I would have a very necessary reason not to work without interruption therefore reducing my stress level.</p><p> It's been a glorious journey. Adopting Rhondo, our male Boxer-Dalmatian-Who-Knows-What-Else Mix from the Humane Society has been one of the most rewarding and fun experiences of my life.</p><p> Not only is he one of the kindest beings I have ever encountered, full of love and joy, but also a compassionate and attentive companion. He pays attention to every move I make and his ability to tune into my mood and energy is quite stunning.</p><h3> Which brings me (of course) to my favorite professional topic.  </h3><p> <br/> My passion to elevate the reputation of sales and its practitioners. I know that consultative selling has become an overused term but for lack of a better expression that's what I have been focusing in on the last couple of years. Whether we call it consultative or mindful selling is really not the point. The point is that there are times when I feel that my dog has more intuition than many sales people out there. One of my friends sent me an e-mail the other day (she knows that I write a blog on selling) with the request to write about the lack of attention sales people pay to the people they call on.</p><p> My friend owns a PR agency and like most business owners gets solicited by sales people on a regular basis. According to my friend, the sales person mispronounced her name although she picked up the phone stating her name very clearly. It's often the desperation to get their pitch across that keeps sales people from paying attention and listening.</p><p> Then, the sales person immediately jumped into the pitch, never asking if it was a good time to talk or not. And here is where the comparison with my dog comes in.</p><p> My dog Rhondo hardly ever interrupts my thoughts or work because he intuitively feels when I have time to play or when I am focused on something else. It's the way I move and the way I sound that provides hints to my dog. Rhondo is in my office with me every single day. He never barks, never even makes a sound. He lies on the office couch (yes, he is spoiled!) and it is not until I put my headphones back into the holder, making a gentle click, signaling to him that I might be ready for a break. That's when he starts moving. But it's not until I get up and tell him that we are leaving the office that he actually leaves the couch to follow me.</p><p> Yes, granted, a telephone conversation is a bit different as you don&rsquo;t have visual clues, but if you take the time to listen and pay attention you will pick up on certain other clues to provide you with a roadmap on how to move forward.</p><h3> So here are Rhondo&rsquo;s 5 Sales Lessons:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1) Always ask if it's a good time to speak.   </strong></p><p> <strong>  2) Never, ever start off with a pitch, especially not when you have just mispronounced the person's name. </strong> It's not only unprofessional, it's also quite rude.</p><p> <strong>  3) Find a way to emotionally connect. Nobody wants to be sold to, no matter how attractive the offering is </strong> . If you cannot connect to a person emotionally, they will not listen to what you have to say. My dog had to learn it the hard way. He now knows that eagerness and barking will only result in being banned from the office couch.  </p><p> <strong>  4) Show authentic interest in your prospects. </strong> Sales people who don't focus on the human facets of conversations will not be able to sell successfully. Even worse, they will leave a bad impression. The sales person who called on my friend was trying to sell PR services (at least he was targeting the right person). It's not the lack of interest in those services that will keep my friend from buying. It's the lack of interest in her as a person that made her discontinue the dialogue. And on top of it, she shared the story with me and I am sharing it with all you fine people. Word of mouth is powerful. </p><p> <strong>  5) And finally, paying attention to your environment, to the people you are communicating with is crucial, whether you are a human or a dog. </strong></p>",

It&rsquo;s had such a profound impact on the way we produce, view and share video online that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the web without it.  </p><p> YouTube was fundamental in bringing video to the web - what's the next step in the relationship between the web and video?</p><p> We already see limited interactivity with YouTube Annotations where viewers are able to subscribe and follow links to other videos and websites.</p><p> But technologies like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.touchcast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Touchcast  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://popcornjs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Popcorn.js  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.zaption.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Zaption  </a> </u>  - to name just a few - claim that they are bringing the &lsquo;web to video&rsquo;. They allow producers to make their content interactive by enabling their viewers to click on the video to connect to related articles, videos and real-time data.  </p><p> Producers can also include quizzes, questions and collect audience feedback as well as detailed analytics.</p><p> Earlier this year, international news provider the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/video/what-you-missed-gop-gets-less-old-less-white/EEB9E565-0F83-4DCF-95FB-C53DB205E3D8.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Wall Street Journal began using Touchcast  </a> </u>  to create interactive video. They described it as one of \"the most important things they were going to be doing in 2015.&rdquo;  They are keen to tell the viewer that they now &ldquo;control the story&rdquo;. </p><p> <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/wall-street-journal-interactive-video-touchcast.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Wall Street Journal use Touchcast for their interactive video news content\" src=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/images/blog/wall-street-journal-interactive-video-touchcast.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> It provides a tailored experience to their audience as they can now access in-depth information directly from the news bulletin about the stories that interest them the most.   </p><p> Many producers have adopted a  <a href=\"http://www.raptmedia.com/project/deloitte\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &lsquo;  <u>   Choose Your Own Adventure  </u>  &rsquo; </a>  approach. Viewers can not only tailor their content but also benefit from feedback and responses to their input and decisions.</p><p> In February this year we saw the launch of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/MadilynBailey/ChooseYourView\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   YouTube&rsquo;s multi-angle editor  </a> </u>  which enables viewers to choose their own camera angle during a live or recorded performance.  </p><p> Thanks to 10 years of YouTube, viewers can now watch what they want, when they want and now they can choose how they watch it.</p><p> So far, interactive video is about giving more control to audiences and providing more than just a passive viewing experience.</p><h3> But what interests me the most is how video can become more integrated with the web.  </h3><p> <br/> As video becomes more interactive and clickable we will see the boundaries between web and video dissolve and the integration of the two becoming increasingly seamless.  </p><p> This could change the way we view video online as it no longer needs to be static and linear but something malleable and responsive.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GraceBluerock\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Grace Bluerock  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seekingincrease.com/before-you-leave-your-job/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Seeking Increase  </a> </u></p><p> Making the decision to start doing work you love is one of the most important decisions you will ever make in your life.</p><p> It can also be one of the most difficult decisions too, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be.</p><p> It is important to know the right questions to ask yourself in determining if now is the time to start doing work you love.</p><p> ​I have recently gone through the process of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seekingincrease.com/transition-to-work-you-love/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   transitioning from my job to doing my life&rsquo;s work  </a> </u> .</p><p> During that time, I could see many pros and cons of both, and I spent many sleepless nights going over the pros and cons, hoping that the answer to my question would become crystal clear.</p><p> That question, of course, was, &ldquo;Should I stay where I am or finally start doing the work I love?&rdquo;</p><p> Over time, that answer became more and more clear, and finding that answer within me actually came down to asking the right questions.</p><p> I want you to avoid the sleepless nights that can go hand in hand with making a major life decision. As you are contemplating continuing with your current job or making the transition to doing work you love, ask yourself these three questions.</p><h3> What do I value more, security or passion?</h3><p> <br/> There is no right or wrong answer to this question. Most people value both of these, but usually one of these will be more predominant, depending upon when in your life you ask yourself this question.</p><p> So, give some thought to this.</p><p> For me, this question caused me to inquire more deeply into myself, invoking the following self-inquiries:</p><p> How much longer do I continue to avoid a risk by staying comfortable? Do I stay in a situation that is not in complete alignment with my dreams, or do I step out to express my full potential by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seekingincrease.com/keep-your-dreams-moving-forward/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   following my dreams  </a> </u>  and helping others to do the same? Do I continue to limit myself to company rules and to state and federal guidelines, or do become my own boss and live and work by my own rules on my own schedule?</p><h3> Am I living my dream in my current work?</h3><p> <br/> Is your current work in alignment with your mission for your life?</p><p> Sometimes, you can bring aspects of doing what you love into your current work. You may have enough of what you love in your current work that you can be satisfied and fulfilled, or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seekingincrease.com/job-dissatisfaction/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   what you are currently doing may be the complete opposite of what you love to do  </a> </u> .</p><p> This is personal for everyone, and only you can answer this question.</p><p> Doing the work I love resonates loudly with my mission in a way that no job I have ever had has been able to. What motivates and inspires me in doing the work I love is helping others identify and start living their dream, not someone else&rsquo;s dream for them, but their dream. I am able to do this through the internet and thus can serve many, creating an unlimited potential to positively affect many lives.</p><p> On the other hand, my motivation in my job was about doing what my job description dictated and doing what others (boss, upper management, co-workers, clients) expected of me. By being limited to a particular job and job site, there was limited potential to positively affect many lives.</p><h3> When I am on my deathbed, will I be happy with the life I chose to live?</h3><p> <br/> I spent six years working in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hospice.org/hospice-care/what-is-hospice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   hospice  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://getpalliativecare.org/whatis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   palliative care  </a> </u>  and gained so  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seekingincrease.com/learned-from-the-dying/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   much insight from people who were dying  </a> </u> . As they looked back upon and evaluated their lives, there were two main themes I commonly heard:</p><li> &ldquo;I wish I had not been so afraid to live a life true to myself, instead of one that others expected me to live.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;I wish I had allowed myself to experience more happiness.&rdquo;</li><p> <br/> How would you look back on your life? Did you do all you set out to do? Did you live large? Were you fulfilled in your life&rsquo;s work? Did you make a positive impact of those around you? Did you leave a legacy behind? Do you have any regrets?</p><p> By looking at this question now, you have time to create a life that you can look back on someday and say, &ldquo;I lived my life to the fullest; I was true to myself; I was happy; I loved deeply; I experienced everything I wanted to experience; and I made a difference.&rdquo;</p><p> Answering the above three questions should give you more clarity and spark new insight into your decision about starting to do the work you love or staying where you are.</p><p> By giving deep thought to what you value most, to the extent you are living according to your mission, and what legacy you want to leave behind, you will be much closer to knowing the best and most fulfilling option for you.</p><p> <strong>  Are you ready to start doing work you love?  </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Whether we like it or not, most of us are spending more time with our coworkers each week than with our own families.</p><p> Peer relationships play a critical role in the modern workplace, something a recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://go.globoforce.com/rs/globoforce/images/Fall_2014_Mood_Tracker.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Globoforce survey  </a> </u>  examined in depth:</p><li> 95% of respondents in that survey said they&rsquo;d made at least one friend at work</li><li> 93% reported valuing the respect of their coworkers</li><li> Employees with even one friend at work are less likely to jump ship and more likely to be engaged</li><p> <br/> Coworker friendships aren&rsquo;t all just about dissecting the latest episode of Game of Thrones at the watercooler or sharing pictures of kids over email (although that&rsquo;s important too). Strong peer-to-peer relationships strengthen company loyalty, employee engagement, productivity, and overall workplace satisfaction.</p><p> But camaraderie between colleagues isn&rsquo;t created out of thin air; it&rsquo;s forged on the battlefield of everyday interactions, both professional and personal. What organizations can do is recognize the vital role that employee friendships play by fostering a work culture that promotes that camaraderie and hiring new employees who fit that culture.</p><h3> The Psychology of Work Friendships</h3><p> <br/> Human beings crave a common connection with those around us, so it&rsquo;s only natural that coworkers, who spend so much time with each other, break the barrier between acquaintances and friends.</p><p> Once these friendships are established, though, the way employees work together also shifts.</p><p> In an excerpt from his book  <u>  The Best Place to Work: The Art and Science of Creating an Extraordinary Workplace </u> , social psychologist Ron Friedman uses a study conducted by management professors to illustrate this point. Researchers at the Universities of Minnesota and Pennsylvania asked a group of friends and a group of acquaintances to complete different assignments.</p><p> Friedman reports that &ldquo;friends outperformed acquaintances on both tasks&rdquo; because they &ldquo;were more committed at the start of a project, showed better communication while doing the activity, and offered teammates positive encouragement every step of the way. They also evaluated ideas more critically and gave one another feedback when they were off course.&rdquo;</p><p> In contrast, acquaintances operated in silos and only engaged each other when it was necessary, so their lack of connection held them back in how they completed the tasks.</p><p> Simply put, work friendships don&rsquo;t just make collaborating more fun or easier, but they also transform the way in which colleagues interact with each other in the process and support each other.  </p><h3> Motivation to Go the Extra Mile</h3><p> <br/> Research tells us that friends work better together, but friendship also makes a positive impact on non-collaborative work by creating an overall culture of trust and loyalty.</p><p> Christine M. Riordan, a professor of management at the University of Kentucky, writes in the  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/07/we-all-need-friends-at-work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u>  that camaraderie is &ldquo;about creating a common sense of purpose and the mentality that we are in it together.&rdquo; This group loyalty then &ldquo;results in a shared commitment to and discipline toward the work.&rdquo;</p><p> Basically we are more motivated to work because we don&rsquo;t want to let down our friends.</p><p> Our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tinyhr.com/2014-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2014 Employee Engagement Report  </a> </u>  also found evidence to support this idea. When we asked what motivates employees to go the extra mile, peers &mdash; not money &mdash; came out on top, with 20% of those surveyed highlighting the importance of camaraderie.</p><p> When given the chance to elaborate, employees repeatedly highlighted the hard work and dedication of their peers.</p><p> Economists, too, have long studied the positive impact of peers on worker productivity. In one study of cashiers at a supermarket chain,  <u>  <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/text20.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   researchers from the University of California-Berkeley found  </a> </u>  that when employees saw their coworkers producing at a high level, they felt social pressure to improve their own performance.</p><p> Although workers weren&rsquo;t always motivated by altruism, these researchers concluded that &ldquo;when workers hold themselves accountable to their peers, workplaces have the potential to be cooperative environments.&rdquo;</p><p> In short, peers influence how employees perform &mdash; and friendships between coworkers take that influence to the next level, leading to improved productivity.</p><h3> Create a Culture of Camaraderie</h3><p> <br/> A positive workplace culture that encourages friendships and collaboration isn&rsquo;t a fluke thing that happens because the right people happen to work at the same place. It&rsquo;s built from scratch and begins with the hiring process. Here are a few steps to take:</p><li> <p>  Mine the interview: Ask questions that identify candidates who aren&rsquo;t just high performers but who can work collaboratively and engage openly with their peers. </p></li><li> <p>  Hire for attitude:   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241743\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Craig Cincotta   </a>  </u>  , the Vice President for Brand Development at Porch.com, contends an employee with a great attitude &ldquo;gets people focusing on the right behaviors, which ultimately leads to better business results and overall employee satisfaction.&rdquo; </p></li><li> <p>  Create a mentorship program: Partner employees with each other and not just at the supervisor-employee level.   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/23944_3___Peer_Coworker_Relationships.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Patricia Sias   </a>  </u>  , a professor of communication at Washington State University, notes that &ldquo;peer mentoring is important to an individual&rsquo;s career experience and profession.&rdquo; Mentoring shouldn&rsquo;t solely be a supervisor-subordinate relationship but one that also exists between peers on the same rung of the ladder. </p></li><li> <p>  Let employees recognize their peers: Our   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.tinyhr.com/2014-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    2014 Employee Engagement Report   </a>  </u>   found that when offered the chance, 44% of all employees will give each other recognition. Peer-to-peer recognition also works to create engaged, loyal employees who are there to support each other. Give employees the tools to recognize their peers for good work. </p></li><li> <p>  Set clear expectations but don&rsquo;t set boundaries: Teams need direction and an understanding of what&rsquo;s expected of them on the job, but they may not benefit from rules that separate personal from professional.   <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/104197/tenth-element-great-managing.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup  </a>   has long studied the impact of friendship on employee engagement, concluding in a 2008 report that &ldquo;companies do far better to harness the power of this kind of social capital than to fight against it.&rdquo; </p></li><p> With 7 out of 10 American workers reportedly disengaged, strong bonds between colleagues could be the difference between a disengaged workforce and a highly engaged workplace. Millennials, who now make up the largest share of the workforce, are especially keen to form friendships at work, which they say makes them feel happy, motivated, and productive.</p><p> <strong>  Encourage a friendly organizational culture by hiring people who will gel together, both on a personal level and in their professional dealings with each other. </strong> Your employees and your bottom line will thank you.</p> ",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Paula Taylor | <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Econnexx  </u> </a></p><h3> From Prospect To Client: Content creates a whole new world of Sales opportunities</h3><p> <br/> Inbound and content marketing is about attracting strangers from across the Internet and nurturing them to become delighted clients with the use of marketing automation processes.</p><p> But how do you attract these strangers, and then build the necessary credibility and trust that is essential to a long-term business relationship? The answer is content.</p><p> Content in all of its forms, e-books, white-papers, blogs, case studies, videos, and infographics are how organisations are capturing attention, building credibility, and eventually closing sales. In this blog post I would like examine how you can use specific types of content to positively influence the sales process at every level within Financial services.</p><h3> Mapping Content To The Buyers Journey</h3><p> <br/> To effectively use content throughout the buying process you must first understand the stages that your buyers go through when making a purchase decision. These purchase categories can be broken down into three basic levels:</p><li> <strong>  Awareness Stage: </strong> In the awareness stage the prospect realises that they have an issue that needs to be resolved. So they start researching to better understand and frame their problem.</li><li> <strong>  Consideration Stage:  </strong> In the consideration stage the prospect has a clearly defined idea of the problem. Additionally, they have researched all of the potential solutions to the problem that they are facing.</li><li> <strong>  Decision Stage:  </strong> This is where the buyer has evaluated all of the different solutions and now has to choose a vendor to help them solve their problem. <br/>  </li><p> Understanding the high level stages that your buyers go through allows you to better map content to each one of these stages. Individuals that are working through a purchase decision will be looking for different types of content depending on where they are in their research process.</p><h3> Content for the Awareness Phase</h3><p> <br/> In each stage your potential client will be looking for different types of information. As stated above, the awareness stage is when the prospect realises that they have a problem. Additionally, this is when the prospect starts researching the issue that they are facing.</p><p> At this point the prospect is looking for educational content to help them frame the issue. So it&rsquo;s essential for financial firms to produce content that will help the prospect better understand their problem. Content that helps advance the prospects goals at this stage are things like:</p><li> <strong>  eBooks </strong></li><li> <strong>  White-papers </strong></li><li> <strong>  Research Reports. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> This content helps to educate the prospect and brings context to the issue at hand. </p><h3> Content for Consideration Phase</h3><p> Once the prospect has a clearly articulated idea of the problem they are facing they move from the awareness stage to the consideration stage. At this point they are looking for content related to solutions.</p><p> The prospect wants to understand all of their options relating to their issue and what type of financial services will solve their problem.</p><p> It is important to produce content that resolve their issues. Such as:</p><li> <strong>  Service Specific Guides </strong></li><li> <strong>  Personalised Nurturing Emails </strong></li><li> <strong>  Service Related Video Content </strong> <br/>  </li><p> By producing this &ldquo;middle-of-the-funnel&rdquo; content we help further educate prospects on potential solutions.</p><h3> Content for Decision Stage</h3><p> <br/> The final stage in the buyer&rsquo;s journey is the decision stage. At this point in the buying cycle the prospects clearly understand all aspects of their problem, and potential solutions for helping them resolve their problem. It&rsquo;s the decision stage where the prospect makes a determination on the right firm to help them solve their problem.</p><p> In this phase firms need to be producing content that promotes their organisation and entices the prospect to make a decision and make contact:</p><li> <strong>  Granular Product Literature </strong></li><li> <strong>  Service Differentiator Material </strong></li><li> <strong>  Testimonials/Special offerings etc. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> This content will help you promote your service while demonstrating relevance to the needs of each prospect.</p><h3> The Bottom Line</h3><p> <br/> The shift in buying behaviour has mandated a shift in the way that financial services firms need to market and sell their services. Additionally, it has elevated the importance of content at every stage of the sales cycle. Smart organisations are taking time to clearly understand the purchasing decisions of their buyer persona&rsquo;s, while mapping highly relevant and educational content to each stage of the process.</p><p> If you would like to find out how we utilise content along with inbound and automated marketing to deliver significant results for financial firms?

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> According to a recent survey conducted by Buyersphere, although B2B buyers are, of course, interested in getting the best price for a product or service, there are many other factors that affect their purchasing decisions.</p><p> With that in mind, I recently read a useful article over on the B2B Marketing website that explored some of the lass tangible factors that can affect that all-important final decision. So, what does your buyer really really want from you?</p><h3> Someone who communicates well</h3><p> People like to buy from people, not faceless corporations. This means that the suppliers who communicate effectively and spend time building 1:1 relationships are the ones who'll be most successful at winning new business &ndash; which is where social media can be particularly useful.</p><p> The Buyersphere report found that these communication factors actually made more of an impact than price: suppliers who show that they understand the buyer's needs; suppliers who respond quickly with quality information; suppliers who communicate more frequently; suppliers who use email more effectively.</p><h3> Someone who understands them</h3><p> As well as business needs, the individual buyer will also have needs and motivations of their own. Understand their pain points, their persona, and how you can meet their specific challenges, before tailoring your communication in line with this information. This will make you stand out from the competition.</p><h3> Someone who reassures them</h3><p> Buyers are often anxious when making a purchasing decision that could affect their working life, as one bad move could impact their reputation, credibility or even their career. This makes them incredibly averse to risk, so they'll navigate towards the supplier who shows that they are reliable and is able to put their mind at ease. Confidence in the supplier was one of the most important factors involved in the purchasing decision. The old saying, \"Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM\" rings as true today as it's ever done, at least in terms of the principle that underpins it.</p><h3> Someone who is similar to them</h3><p> Cultural fit is also incredibly important, as B2B relationships are, hopefully, for the medium to long term. Therefore big brands tend to feel most comfortable dealing with other big brands, creative types want to work with other creative types etc.</p><p> As far as possible then, it makes sense to try to match your target client's approach in your tone, style and communications. This is not to say that you should pretend to be something you&rsquo;re not. But, just as you dress differently depending on the type of event you&rsquo;re attending or people you&rsquo;ll be meeting, so you can adapt your marketing and communications approach to fit the profile of your target buyer.</p>",

    "content": "<p> There are many research studies out there which demonstrate that the markets cannot be predicted by advisors and investors. The role of the advisor should be about managing the behavioral biases of their clients. The advisor is in a key position to influence the behavior of clients.</p><p> As human beings we all have certain decision-making biases that are hard-wired into us from early in life. These hard-wired behavioral biases can be predicted, as they are inherently part of our DNA which is scientifically measurable. The biases will usually reveal themselves in times of higher market volatility when a person is under more pressure or when a major life event takes place.</p><p> The key for investors is not to churn their accounts too much in times of volatility. For some advisors and investors whose DNA is more wired to be &ldquo;fast-paced,&rdquo; overtrading will be a greater temptation. As an investor, it is important to know how much your account is being actively managed. Active management can equate to overtrading and in the end could be costly or even destructive if not properly moderated.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog-pic-mm2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"blog pic mm2\" src=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog-pic-mm2.png\"/> </a></p><p> The other bias to recognize is that investors have a much greater aversion to losses than gains. Those investors whose DNA is more wired to be &ldquo;patient&rdquo; and &ldquo;risk-averse&rdquo; will feel the pain of losses much more; so managing their emotions in times of volatility is very important. These clients will need a portfolio that is very different from those that are higher risk-takers.</p><p> To know how to advise and communicate with each client uniquely in times of volatility, the Financial DNA Market Mood Dashboard will provide you with the insights for each client. Some clients will feel a level of exuberance in down markets since they see it as a buying opportunity and others will be fearful.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Blog-pic-MM.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Blog pic MM\" src=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Blog-pic-MM.png\"/> </a></p> ",

    "content": "<h3> Is it appropriate to share success with influencers?</h3><p> <br/> Or, to put it another way, should you share remuneration or the spoils of the sale with referrers?</p><p> It is actually just a little more complicated than that.  Before trying to answer the question of what to do with the harvest, I think it makes a lot more sense to put in the work thinking about how to create the harvest first.</p><p> Jumping straight to the question of &ldquo;what to do when this succeeds&rdquo; seems to come up continually when discussing the topic of developing referral Centres-Of-Influence (COI&rsquo;s), and it is a divisive one.  There are certainly some potential influencers who are definitely interested in getting a share of the spoils, and definitely some advisers who are very happy to share the revenue.  There appear to be a lot more as far as I can tell in both the influencer category and the advisory world who shun the idea &ndash; and I admit I am one of who doesn&rsquo;t think it appropriate to pay a COI for leads.  My perception of the mood in professional services generally on this topic is that the &ldquo;nays&rdquo; far outweigh the &ldquo;yays&rdquo;.</p><p> This seems to be especially true when talking with professionals from non-financial-services sectors, such as lawyers and accountants and bankers.  There is a strong ethical leaning away from the idea of sharing in the revenue for a professional referral. That feeling appears to be so strong much of the time that the suggestion of revenue-sharing is in itself a complete professional turn-off, to the point where they wouldn&rsquo;t consider providing professional referrals to someone offering to split revenue or pay spotters fees or anything similar.  So merely suggesting it is often dangerous and completely undermines an advisers efforts to create a COI relationship.</p><p> Yet, I continue to meet and speak with advisers who ask the question because they are willing to share revenue with those who do refer and they are keen to find ways to incentivise such referrals seeing as they believe incentives will generate the desired behaviour.  So it seems that this remains an issue, or a barrier, for many financial advisers trying to cultivate the right type of relationship with potential influencers.</p><p> I believe the appropriate thing to do is is to be transparent and show a willingness to share success, but in such a way that it doesn&rsquo;t compromise the professional position of the influencer.  Being transparent means being open about the fact that revenue is being generated from business referrals&hellip;they know that in principle of course, but often influencers have no real idea of what levels of revenue a new client may be worth.  My preference is to be open about the quantum&hellip;how much money is actually on the table.  There are three reasons for this:</p><p> <strong>  1.  I don&rsquo;t want someone to imagine there is more revenue being made than actually is. </strong> They do get influenced by headlines and media stories about the massive amounts of commissions, etc, etc that thieving financial advisers make on the sly.  I want to kill that perception as quickly as I can, and have us dealing with facts.</p><p> <strong>  2. I want them to know that I am being open about everything, including the often unspoken area of &ldquo;money&rdquo;. </strong>  Open-ness leads to trust, and that is a critical ingredient in building a successful professional COI relationship.</p><p> <strong>  3.  I want to be commercial about it. It is a business tactic, and I am not hiding from that. </strong></p><p> I want to prepare for a good harvest by putting in the right groundwork first.</p><p> When positioning with potential COI&rsquo;s then I suggest being quite open about the typical client engagement, and the typical revenue generated from that engagement.  While being open about it, be open also about the fact that this a key element of your marketing &ndash; and as a business person I have a marketing budget.  I have to spend money each year to continue getting clients&hellip;that is just a fact of business.  So too does the COI usually.  They get it.</p><p> Typically we would allocate some 10-15% of the firms revenue to prospecting type efforts over the course of a production year, wouldn&rsquo;t we?  Isn&rsquo;t this a prospecting effort?</p><p> If a COI relationship does provide good quality and well qualified business prospects then that is business I do not have to pay to find in the broader market place, and that is effectively a saving in marketing costs for my business.</p><h3> Doesn&rsquo;t it seem reasonable and fair to allocate that saved marketing budget elsewhere?</h3><p> <br/> There are a number of ways we could use it, and I give the COI the choice in how that might be done.  The opening suggestions are:</p><p> <strong>  a.  we can rebate it in some form directly to clients, either by way of a reduced fee or in some form of &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to them from both of us. </strong></p><p> <strong>  b.  we can allocate it to a charity or community organisation as a form of sponsorship from you or your firm, or even from the client potentially. </strong></p><p> <strong>  c.  we can do something else with it if you&rsquo;ve got a better idea&hellip;.. </strong></p><p> Option C of course does provide an opening for that occasional influencer who does want to discuss revenue sharing&hellip;but few do in my experience.</p><p> Option A fits neatly with most professionals views of what is appropriate, and it also provides a clear value directly to the clients which is a direct reflection of the COI&rsquo;s involvement.  In other words, the client gets a valuable discount or rebate simply because they are a client of the COI.  Everyone wins in that one.</p><p> Option B appeals to the truly altruistic, or those with a cause which is especially important to them.  It is also useful for those COI&rsquo;s who do have strong views on professional positioning and do not wish to create any sense at all of discounting or rebating expectations flowing from mutual clients back to their own business.</p><p> <strong>  As with so many things in professional services, the essential question asked at the beginning is actually a reasonable question. </strong>  Commercially it makes sense to consider the issue.  The adviser and any COI (usually) have commercial requirements&hellip;they are running businesses and need to generate revenue and make a profit if they are to keep staff employed and continue providing ongoing service and advice to clients.  Therefore it IS fair to consider how to do the business in a profitable way.</p><p> <strong>  But; as with so many things in professional services, the essential question is inter-woven with a host of other questions concerning ethics, regulatory expectations, statutory obligations, branding and professional images, customer perceptions and value&hellip;.and on it goes. </strong>  Somehow we have to balance all of these questions from all of the potential stakeholders (which is way more than just you and the COI who are having the actual conversation) and then be able to come up with a solution, or range of solutions, which meet the expectations of all stakeholders as well as achieving the commercial purpose.</p><p> So rather than approach the problem with a clumsy and inelegant offer to share, think about how you can help the COI and the COI&rsquo;s clients be better off while still acknowledging that we are in business and trying to create a mutually beneficial arrangement.</p><p> &ldquo;Mutually beneficial&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t just mean you and the COI&hellip;.it means something which works to meet ALL stakeholders expectations&hellip;the customer, regulators, staff, suppliers&hellip;everyone involved.  This is an area where the right outcome is one that scores a &ldquo;win&rdquo; for everyone.</p><p> It really is about sharing the harvest.  However, to get the crops in successfully means a lot of work beforehand.  You can&rsquo;t jump striaght to preparing for the feast&hellip;</p>",

    "content": "<h3> How Can They Become Part of the Business Process?</h3><p> There was a recent article in the Wall Street Journal about how the &ldquo;blue chips&rdquo; are blue because of poor sales and earnings growth and little stock market appreciation. The article includes examples of industry and category leaders like Caterpillar, Proctor &amp; Gamble, IBM, General Electric, AT&amp;T, Coca-Cola and  DuPont.</p><p> <strong>  I have been arguing for years that this should be no surprise, because society and business fail to recognize old paradigms and structures are failing: </strong></p><li> ​Large corporate structures, like print publications, big banks, and brick and mortar retailers, are all gradual losers, or even worse. <br/>  </li><li> Companies and society continue to do what they have done in the past, often with poor results.  Despite massive economic and political efforts, issues like income inequality, healthcare, and infrastructure investment will continue to hold back our economy. <br/>  </li><li> With little real attention to these changing trends and other factors, poor performance of many organizations is virtually a given. <br/>  </li><li> What is even more distressing is that it is the structure of these organizations that produces much of the results, rather than the typical financial discussions.  For instance, the long held propositions that bigness advantages, like economies of scale and utilizing expertise and marketing synergies, are simply false in many cases. <br/>  </li><li> Rather, these and other blue chips are seeing blue  because of the following limitations: <br/>   <li>  First, many large companies have tunnel vision, organizational constraints, etc., and ignore emerging technologies and opportunities. </li> <li>  Second, they lack the flexibility to respond to the needs of the market and use outdated solutions to new problems. </li> <li>  Third, they fail to allow the vision, entrepreneurship, and risk necessary to succeed, while heaping huge income growth on unproductive leaders. </li></li><p> <br/> What is even more perplexing is that we continue to ignore some proven models of success. Specifically, I just read a book by Walter Isaacson called The Innovators, about the digital, computer and internet revolution. One of the most interesting themes is the commitment, diversity, collaboration, and even friction, among diverse participants in almost every phase of the revolution, such as Jobs and Wozniak or Gates and Allen.</p><p> This is in direct contrast to the hierarchical structure of most traditional organizations (and especially Wall Street) whose priorities are primarily money and greed. For example, I read books on Goldman Sachs and McKinsey a few months ago. The contrast, in terms of their hierarchy, elitism, and closed environment, was clearly evident.  This was also confirmed by the head of Alibaba (which recently went public) who said the customer, employees, and then investors were his priorities.</p><p> I do not need to review the stock price growth of companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc., compared to the &ldquo;blue chips&rdquo; to demonstrate the success of a new model. And, remember, IBM and Xerox virtually gave everything away to Apple and Microsoft. </p><h3> The technology examples provide numerous opportunities for change:</h3><li> The success of smaller, more innovative companies shows that many organizations should get smaller, or act smaller, in order to effectively deal with today&rsquo;s environment.</li><li> Reducing layers and creating professional cultures are a start. Boards and management need to split up organizations, spinoffs, or create more independent groups. That may be what&rsquo;s really necessary to maximize the potential of both individuals and organizations. <br/>  </li><li> Large organizations say they want excellence, entrepreneurship, innovation, risk takers, etc., but, really, they tend to encourage mediocrity. For example, short term goals and reviews for both organizations and individuals actually inhibit the development of more positive cultural characteristics, rather than spur them on. <br/>  </li><li> Testing and failure, which are critical parts of innovation, are punished more than rewarded. Even sound risk taking is reduced, because of the fear of repercussions within the organization.  In short, organizations frequently ignore the advice &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t score if you don&rsquo;t take a shot.&rdquo;   <br/>  </li><li> Organizations need to be open to measurement and feedback. <br/>   <li>  Looking, understanding, and sharing financials, operations reports, and sales reports are the first step.  Simple research studies, social media, and other devices are additional tools. </li> <li>  Simple management involvement through tools, which might include just walking around or &ldquo;how am I doing?&rdquo; also work. </li> <li>  You need a commitment to open communication.  One of the investors on the &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; TV program had simple advice for an entrepreneur who wouldn&rsquo;t stop talking:  Stop talking and listen!  <br/>    </li></li><li> Open systems and collaboration are like winning the trifecta at the horse track <br/>   <li>  What is emerging today as a potential solution is the acceptance and reliance upon open systems and collaboration.  Open systems have been around for a long time, but are becoming the norm for success. They reject bureaucracy, authority, hierarchy, and closed decision making processes. They encourage participation, diversity, new rules, and to some extent, chaos. </li> <li>  Google, the Internet, Facebook, LinkedIn, smartphones, tablets, etc., are examples of enablers through open systems. Facebook and iPad may seem like play toys to some, but their inherent potential is just in its infancy.  The ability to quickly find information, engage participants, communicate, and see spontaneous actions and decisions, are all results of these new phenomena. </li> <li>  One of the biggest outcomes from open systems is the collaborative decision model. As decisions become more complex, the need for diversity, internationalism, innovation, and expertise are expanded. Again, collaboration, and things like &ldquo;open source&rdquo; programming, are among the key factors in the success of the digital revolution.   <br/>    </li></li><h3> New paradigms for success</h3><p> <br/> These new paradigms: cooperation, smaller can be better, and open collaborative systems, offer great hope for organizations.  While they involve new approaches to problems, the solutions are readily available. What&rsquo;s needed is to allow our organizations to be effective. To do so involves providing opportunity and education.</p><p> I strenuously argue that if we do not learn to accept and accommodate innovation and deviant behavior within and outside organizations, we cannot achieve excellence or change.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  How do you currently handle it when your prospect gives you the stall, &ldquo;I need to think about it&rdquo;?  </strong> If you&rsquo;re like most sales people, you might give a wimpy, half-hearted response and then ask when you can call them back.  That doesn&rsquo;t feel too good, does it?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s face it, whenever you get this objection &ndash; or any other stall that is similar to it like, &ldquo;I need to wait until next week/month,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get back to you it,&rdquo; &ndash; you know as well as I do that it means your prospect isn&rsquo;t sold and will probably not move forward with you.  If you don&rsquo;t believe me, just look at your won/loss rate when you get this objection. </p><h3> The way to handle this, then, is to deal with it when it comes up and get your prospect to reveal what is REALLY holding them back. </h3><p> <br/> The truth is, this objection (like so many) is usually just a smokescreen hiding the real objection&hellip;</p><p> Use any of these rebuttals to get your prospect talking to you, to get them to reveal what is really holding them back, and then maybe, just maybe, you&rsquo;ll have a chance to close the sale.</p><h3> &ldquo;I need to think about it&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Response One: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, obviously there is something that either doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you, or you need to check on something, I&rsquo;m not sure.  But procrastinating on this won&rsquo;t help make this decision easier for you.  Let me ask you this: What proof do I need to give you right now that this will work for you, to help you make that decision?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Response Two: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;You know ________, whenever someone tells me they have to think about it, it&rsquo;s usually because the price isn&rsquo;t exactly where they would like it to be &ndash; is that part of what you need to think about?</p><p> [If Yes]</p><p> Thanks for sharing that with me.  Let me tell you why we price this the way we do, and what you get for that pricing&hellip;</p><p> [Break down each part of your product/service and justify/build value in your price.  When done]:</p><p> You see _________, you get what you pay for with this and then some.  Let&rsquo;s go ahead and put this to work for you so you can start enjoying the benefits today&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Response Three: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;__________ I understand that thinking about it might make sense right now, but help me to understand something &ndash; what exactly is holding you back from this today?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Response Four: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________ let me ask you: if I could email you right now testimonials from other clients that describe how much success they&rsquo;ve had with this program, how much of a difference would that make for you right now?&rdquo;</p><p> [Listen carefully here.  If this won&rsquo;t get them to move forward, then]:</p><p> &ldquo;Then, please, I love to learn, what specifically is holding you back from deciding on this today?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Response Five: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, as you think about the reasons for either moving forward with this or not, I also want you to think about this:</p><p> &ldquo;How much has this been costing you each month by not getting it fixed?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;And tell me, how much time do you and your team spend on this each week?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;And how much more money could you (and your company/sales team/family) make if you finally found a solution that worked?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;And when you think about all the time and energy you&rsquo;ve already spent thinking about this, how much has THAT cost you so far?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;And if you continue to procrastinate, how much more do you think THAT will cost you?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;If you went with our solution and it worked for you, how much would you save/make?&rdquo;</p><p> THEN</p><p> &ldquo;As you can see, continuing to &ldquo;think about this&rdquo; has done nothing to fix it and it has only cost you time, money and energy!  So why don&rsquo;t you finally DO something about this today and starting reaping the rewards right now.  Here&rsquo;s what we need to do&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Response Six: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I understand that you&rsquo;re not quite ready to decide on this.  Out of curiosity, what factors do you still need to consider?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;And what kind of proof would you need to decide to go with us?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;And what else might hold you back from doing this with us?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Response Seven: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;If there was one thing that would get you to say yes on this today, what would it be?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Response Eight: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;__________, generally whenever I tell someone I need to think about it, one of three things is going on: One: I&rsquo;m either weighing other options and want to make sure I&rsquo;m getting the best deal, or Two: What I&rsquo;m looking at just doesn&rsquo;t fit exactly what I need so I want to keep looking, or Three: It&rsquo;s too much money&hellip;. </p><p> &ldquo;Which of those three things is happening for you right now?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Response Nine: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, how much is a new customer worth to you?&rdquo;</p><p> [Listen carefully]</p><p> &ldquo;And do you think what we&rsquo;re talking about here will bring you enough customers to at least pay for this?&rdquo;</p><p> [If No, then they aren&rsquo;t sold on your solution, and you&rsquo;ll need to build more value]</p><p> [If Yes]:</p><p> &ldquo;Then there is no downside here for you and each additional client will simply make you money.  So let&rsquo;s do this: let&rsquo;s sign you up for our introductory offer, and once you see how this WILL make you money, we&rsquo;ll adjust your subscription to make you even more&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Response Ten: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;________ tell me two things: Why would you NOT do this, and why would you DO this with me?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  [Hit MUTE and let them talk&hellip;] </strong></p><p> These rebuttals will work in a variety of situations if you take the time to customize them to your product or service, and then use them consistently.  Ultimately, what you&rsquo;ll find is that if you can get past this smokescreen to the real reason they&rsquo;re not moving forward with you, then you&rsquo;ll have the chance to either build value or clarify something they either don&rsquo;t understand or misunderstand.  And once you do that, you&rsquo;ll finally have a shot at winning their business.</p><p> If you found this article helpful, then you'll love Mike's Completely Updated and Revised eBook, &ldquo;The Complete Book of Phone Scripts.&rdquo; Now over 130 pages of powerful and effective scripts to help you easily get past the gatekeeper, set appointments, overcome objections and close more money!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Writtten by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ItsOnlyAllen\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Allen Quinn  </u> </a></p><p> Tweet Activity has been my addiction since it first came out in February 2015. This brand new Twitter feature was launched for mobile first and is now accessible on your desktop. It's not only extremely easy to understand; it will completely change the way you interact with your tweets and promote on Social Media. </p><h3> What Does Tweet Activity Do? </h3><p> <br/> Tweet Activity is connected with Twitter Ads and Analytics to provide users with instant analytics on their tweets. You can now monitor an individual Tweet and monitor how it is (or isn&rsquo;t) connecting with Twitter users. </p><p> Tweet Activity is represented by a bar graph button (below) that appears at the bottom of every Tweet. You can see this both on your desktop and on your cell.  </p> <img src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5420683ce4b0394ddbf6ffe9/t/556b5e73e4b0817b78d12582/1433100052564/?format=1000w\"/><p>  </p><p> <strong>  When you go to click on View Tweet Activity, you will see how your Tweet is measured, based on:  </strong></p><li> <strong>  Impressions: </strong> The number of times users saw the Tweet on Twitter (but didn&rsquo;t engage with it; just saw it in passing) </li><li> <strong>  Engagements: </strong> Interacted with the Tweet; this means clicking the full Tweet to read it, or if you have a photo/video, them clicking that to view it. </li><li> <strong>  Link clicks: </strong> This is the one that matters most. If you feature a link in your Tweet, Twitter Analytics will measure it and report how many users who engaged with the Tweet actually decided to explore more. </li><p> Oh, and did I mention that it&rsquo;s ALWAYS updating, so you can check regularly and see how it&rsquo;s changed. Another cool thing is watching it right when you Tweet out. I often will go and click the button the second I send out a Tweet, and watch the numbers increase in real time. You just don&rsquo;t get this on any other Social Media platform.  </p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-31 at 11.20.21 AM.png\" src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5420683ce4b0394ddbf6ffe9/t/556b5edbe4b0b179bd6c476e/1433099997480/Screen+Shot+2015-05-31+at+11.20.21+AM.png?format=1000w\"/><h3> How Does This Benefit Me &amp; My Buiness?</h3><p> <br/> How does it not?! This feature is a HUGE deal for businesses and those wanting to grow their brand and increase traffic to their site. You can see whether or not your Tweets are connecting with the public. Tweet Activity gives you and your business an opportunity to be aware of it, fix the problem, and stay on top of it once you have fixed what the problem is. You don&rsquo;t get this kind of opportunity on other Social Media platforms.</p><h3> My Engagement Needs Improvement. Now What?</h3><p> <br/> At the bottom of Tweet Activity (below), you will see &lsquo;Promote Your Tweet&rsquo;. You can set how much you want to spend to promote your particular Tweet. The estimated link clicks are actually quite accurate and unlike Facebook, I get REAL engagement from REAL people.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve experimented by putting $20 on a couple Tweets, and it actually exceeded the estimate given. If your Tweet is good and reaches the right people who engage with it, then you can actually pay very little and still get results as if you paid the higher amounts.  </p><img src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5420683ce4b0394ddbf6ffe9/t/556b5fe7e4b032d87ead9bd1/1433100294682/?format=1000w\"/><h3> I'm In! Where Do I Sign Up?</h3><p> <br/> Easy. Before you can access Tweet Activity, you got to head on over to Twitter Ads and enable it. Go to ads.twitter.com and/or  <u>  <a href=\"http://analytics.twitter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   analytics.twitter.com  </a> </u>  (I don&rsquo;t remember which I did because I was using it right when it came out and it&rsquo;s changed quite a bit). From there, log into your Twitter account and there you go! You should be able to return to your timeline and be able to click on the button and watch that engagement unravel at your fingertips.</p><h3> How Has Tweet Activity Changed The Way I Tweet?</h3><p> <br/> Tweet Activity personally has enhanced my Twitter experience for the better. Now I&rsquo;m not just posting things on Twitter and leaving it to chance. I&rsquo;m completely interacting and working with it. Tweet Activity has given me the opportunity to experiment and find what is the best way to get the most engagement and interaction from my followers, and what I can do differently to attract new ones. </p><p> The measurement of click links to my website is incredibly important, and for anyone or any business, this is your new best friend. I find if my engagement is high, but my link clicks are low then I need to change the way I introduce the link or try a different photo or a more enticing selling point. What&rsquo;s even better is I can view all this before even paying a cent. It saves wasting money so it&rsquo;s a really good investment.</p><p> I&rsquo;m very excited to see how this feature evolves over time. Twitter is always impressing me time and time again with their new features and updates. Facebook is still the champion, for now, but I think if Twitter continues doing what they&rsquo;re doing and providing simple, easy to understand and work with features, that Twitter will be the one who reigns supreme in the end.  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Expecting a visit from the stork soon or has it already dropped off a new bundle of joy? </strong> If so, you know the full range of emotions that come with a growing family. Along with the love and excitement you feel with a new baby boy or girl, comes the pressure of new responsibilities and additional financial obligations.</p><p> Babies change your life in many ways, including requiring large amounts of time and money. While you may already be thinking about childcare costs and options, or about paying the medical bills that accompanied your new child, there are several other &ndash; important &ndash; financial considerations you should be thinking about even before the new baby arrives.</p><h3> Evaluate Financial Priorities.</h3><p> It&rsquo;s important to consider both short-term and long-term expenses that come with the addition of a new family member. It is a natural impulse, for instance, to want to put your child first and redirect retirement savings into college savings. But remember, you can borrow for college but you cannot borrow your way through retirement. It&rsquo;s also important to balance long-term goals, like retirement and college expenses, with current financial needs, to help you allocate resources in an appropriate way.</p><h3> Update Insurance Needs and Your Will.</h3><p> With the expansion of your family, insurance needs can change significantly. Having enough insurance is important in feeling confident about your family&rsquo;s financial future. Adding your child to your health insurance policy can usually be done with a phone call. Making sure you have enough life insurance for both parents can help ensure you have the funds to raise your child if the unthinkable happens. Short-term disability insurance provides benefits if you have an accident that takes you out of work temporarily. Long-term disability insurance is critical in case a major accident has a permanent impact on your ability to work and earn. While some companies offer disability insurance, it can also be purchased independently.</p><p> Updating your will or creating a trust can provide care instructions for your child and allocate resources for their upbringing. Without a will or trust, if you and your spouse die, the state will decide who will raise your children. A will establishes your wishes for who will care for your child. A trust can direct funds specifically earmarked for raising your children and can be an effective way to cover financial expenses and provide for college expenses.</p><h3> Start Planning For College Early.</h3><p> The sooner you start the better. While it is impossible to know exactly how much you&rsquo;ll need to save &ndash; given that you don&rsquo;t know what kind of college your child will choose &ndash; consider that in 2013-2014 the cost of a moderate in-state public university was $22,826 per academic year and the cost of a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; private university averaged $44,750, according to a College Board survey. &sup1;</p><p> For new parents this means that college could cost over $100,000 for a public college and more than double that number for private school. Instead of trying to fund the entire cost of their education, determine how much you want to contribute. Having children be responsible for a part of their education is often a good lesson in work ethic, even if you can afford to pay for everything, and a critical life lesson if you can&rsquo;t.</p><h3> Keep Spending and Debt under Control.</h3><p> When you have an adorable child it&rsquo;s very easy to overspend. You want them to have the best of everything. Setting a budget and sticking with that can help you keep your spending in line with your established budget. This can also help you maintain the discipline needed to continue contributions to long-term financial goals like retirement and their college education. And remember, the best gift you can give your children &ndash; your time and attention &ndash; is free.</p><p> Another important consideration is debt. When you carry debt, you are paying today for yesterday&rsquo;s bills. Investing potentially allows you to pay today for tomorrow&rsquo;s bills. By keeping yesterday&rsquo;s bills settled and debt to a minimum, you lay the foundations for having enough to enjoy today with your children and plan for tomorrow.</p><h3> Teach Children About Finances At An Early Age.</h3><p> Finances are a part of our daily lives. When you involve children early on they gain an appreciation for what things cost and how to choose what we want and what we can live without. As soon as your child old enough, start helping save their pennies for something they really want, and teach them that work is part of the process of earning money. These skills, if taught early, can lead to a lifetime of responsible money management.</p><p> Parenting is an amazing adventure that changes the way you see yourself and the world. Keeping an eye on finances can provide you with the confidence you need to not only enjoy your growing family but help lay the foundations for a stronger future.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The term &lsquo;mid-life&rsquo; crisis was first identified by psychologist Carl Jung who described it as a normal part of the maturing process. A &lsquo;mid-life&rsquo; crisis has often been associated with depression but mental health experts now say that it&rsquo;s more likely to be called a &lsquo;mid-life&rsquo; transition. It can be a time when we take stock of where we are in life and make some adjustments to the way we live. It can also be a time of reflection: without making major life changes.</p><h3> &lsquo;Mid-life&rsquo; transitions are now looked on as a more normal part of life and might occur anywhere between 35 through to 60 years of age.</h3>The age that it strikes each of us will depend on many factors such as our lifestyle, relationships and how long we may expect to live. A &lsquo;mid-life&rsquo; transitions will typically occur around significant life events such as a &ldquo;zero&rdquo; birthday or when children finish high school or university. Other trigger factors may be <u> <a href=\"https://financialknowledgecentre.com.au/kclogin.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  stress </a></u> due to <u> <a href=\"https://financialknowledgecentre.com.au/kclogin.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  high levels of debt </a></u> or the loss of a parent or loved one.More often the term &ldquo;mid-life&rdquo; crisis has been associated with men but contrary to popular belief, both men and women are equally likely to experience a transition or crisis. However, the type of &lsquo;mid-life&rsquo; event or crisis is likely to look very different for both genders.Research shows that men are more likely to want to prove something and while the stereotypical purchase of a sports car may be synonymous with this; it&rsquo;s more often a case of men gauging their worth by their job performance.Women on the other hand are more likely to seek validity in their relationships and evaluate their performance as a <u> <a href=\"https://financialknowledgecentre.com.au/kclogin.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  mother </a></u> and wife.Both men and women may feel an urge to follow up on some <u> <a href=\"https://financialknowledgecentre.com.au/kclogin.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  dreams </a></u> that may be unfulfilled due to family responsibilities. It is typical for both men and women to be afraid of <u> <a href=\"https://financialknowledgecentre.com.au/kclogin.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ageing </a></u> or not attaining goals they have set themselves.A &lsquo;mid-life&rsquo; transition is an internal process and without proper understanding it can lead a person to make irrational decisions that they may regret later such as leaving a job, divorcing a spouse or making poor financial decisions.<h3> Here are our top 5 tips when it comes to dealing with a mid-life transition:</h3><strong> 1. Acknowledge it</strong>&ndash; Acknowledging the changes happening can help you find a way to move past it.<strong> 2. Think Before Making Any Radical Changes</strong>&ndash; Before quitting a job, buying an expensive car, or leaving a spouse, talk to family members and friends. Sometimes, having an outside opinion can provide a useful perspective.<strong> 3. Get Professional Help</strong>&ndash; There are many different kinds of personal coaching, therapy, medicine, and holistic treatments that can be beneficial.<strong> 4. Use new thoughts and ideas in a positive way.</strong><strong> 5. Talk About it with your Loved Ones. Be honest and open with your loved ones.</strong>A mid-life transition is not necessarily a negative thing as it can often lead to positive changes and motivation to take on new challenges or a different direction. However, the process will be different for everyone and can develop into depression or into an <u> <a href=\"https://financialknowledgecentre.com.au/kclogin.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  opportunity for growth </a></u> depending on many factors including the love and support of family and friends or guidance from a professional.",

    "content": "<h3> That buzzing you hear in the municipal market is the swaps nest. </h3><p> <br/> In early 2000s, many municipal issuers entered into IR Swap agreements because interest rates had fallen to, at the time, very low levels.  The idea was that funding costs would fall as interest rates rose because many municipal issuers were paying a fixed interest rate and receiving a floating interest rate.</p><p> As a reminder, an IR Swaps agreement is between two private parties where one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for another. For instance, a municipal issuer would engage a bank and exchange a fixed payment for a floating payment linked to an index, like LIBOR.</p><p> Well, interest rates did not rise but fell and have been held at the zero bound for almost seven years.  Mark-to-market pricing further excited the swap nest because as interest rates fell the fixed rate payer saw the value of the IR Swap decline. </p><p> The result was a potentially large reduction in balance sheet strength and increased leverage ratios.  Less balance sheet strength and more leverage is a credit negative. </p><p> Furthermore, IR Swaps can have specific covenants such as maintaining a minimum credit quality. If the covenants are breached then the counterparty can trigger a termination clause and require that the market-to-market value of the IR Swap be delivered.  These types of events can cause even more strain on liquidity ratios then the negative arbitrages of unbalanced payment streams and ultimately  a spiral into a default. </p><h3> The City of Chicago&rsquo;s recent turmoil is partially due to rating downgrades and subsequent IR Swap terminations. </h3><p> <br/> Chicago&rsquo;s termination event couldn&rsquo;t have come at a worse time because as the U.S. economy continues to improve the likelihood of the Federal Reserve removing easy monetary policies grows.  Many market pundits would argue that rising interest rates are bad for bond investors and credit quality for issuers that need to roll debt or borrow more because the costs rise. But in in the case of municipal issuers with outstanding IR Swap exposure rising interest rates can be a credit positive and help calm the swaps nest.</p>Source: Bloomberg; SNWAM Research",

Reading is something very few people do. Less than 42% of college graduates ever read a book after graduating. Simply becoming a reader will set you apart and differentiate you from the crowd. We are transformed by the renewing of our minds. Learn how to become a reader. Here&rsquo;s my recommended  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/essential-reading/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  reading list </a>  to get started.</li><li> <strong>  Wear a smile. </strong>  If you can&rsquo;t be happy all the time, at least learn how to appear happy when you are in public. Be positive, enthusiastic and passionate about everything you do. An upbeat, positive, professional attitude stands out. No matter what life throws your way, it&rsquo;s important to show that you can stay confident and upbeat. If you&rsquo;re not having fun , you&rsquo;re not doing it right! People generally enjoy being around folks who are pleasant, encouraging, and uplifting, rather than complaining, negative, and miserable.</li><li> <strong>  Be friendly. </strong>  You should always be the first one to greet others when meeting them. Do it in a musical, upbeat and friendly tone of voice with a firm handshake. Be open and approachable. Engage others and show a genuine interest in their lives and their thoughts. Find a mentor to help you get to know people. Build relationships based on trust. Let your personality shine through in everything you do. Be you!</li><li> <strong>  Communicate intelligently. </strong>  Be confident, respectful, and concise in all of your communication. The reasons effective communication is necessary are obvious. Pay careful attention not only in e-mails, but also in your social media posts, on the phone, and in face-to-face conversations. Give your full attention, maintain eye contact, and don&rsquo;t be glancing at your smart phone.  An attentive, respectful listener is hard to find. Developing great communication habits goes a long way towards standing out from the crowd.</li><li> Be outstanding in your field. Commitment, dedication and involvement stand out. Be more prepared than everyone else on your team. Do your research, gather your resources, and show up prepared and ready to work. If you&rsquo;re actively engaged and make a significant contribution to your team, it will be noticed. Volunteer to take part in charity events or be a part of activities that are outside your duties and obligations.</li><p> Question: How do you stand out from the crowd?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If a business partnership is a lot like a marriage, and there seems to be strong agreement that it is, staff members are the offspring and can be severely affected by partnership conflict.  Like in a family, sometimes staff will just sense underlying tension among partners, but often it is more direct: there are blow-ups, contradictory instructions, or persistent comments about the perceived shortcomings of the other partner that alert employees that there is trouble between partners.</p><h3> Once conflict is out in the open, staff members may align themselves with one or the other partner.</h3>These coalitions can assemble in all sorts of ways, beyond the specific issues in the conflict. They may not even fully understand the issues and base their alliance on partial information. Sometimes it is due to loyalty to who brought them into the organization, to protect their position or general affinity with one of the partners.The extent to which staff members react to partnership conflict can dramatically impact the overallhealth of the business. In a recent partnership conflict that we mediated the acrimony among partners had already caused the defection of a key staff member to a competing firm. This alerted the wider professional community to their internal conflict, affecting their reputation and ability to bring in new clients.  This added to the financial issues which had contributed to their initial conflicts.<h3> When workers begin to take sides and the conflict is no longer contained among the partners it becomes much more complicated to resolve.</h3>Once &ldquo;choosing sides&rdquo; begins, differences are bound to get dangerously entrenched. Actually, this phenomenon was identified by sociologist Friedrich Glasl in his Nine-Stage Model of Conflict Escalation.<img alt=\"\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-13-at-7.39.19-AM.png\" width=\"567\"/>In this model, Stage 4 is a key turning point; it&rsquo;s the stage where coalitions begin to build. This stage signals that &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; outcomes are less likely, replaced by &ldquo;win-lose&rdquo; outcomes.The advice that business partners seek help early on to resolve conflict in their partnership can be easy to ignore.  There are many priorities in a business and addressing conflict is often avoided until critical decisions cannot be made or external factors force a confrontation.  But conflicts are very hard to contain and the fault lines created by coalitions cannot help but make the business less stable and employees more prone to distraction, in-fighting and defections, all of which will have long-lasting negative effects on the business.",

    "content": "<p> As I was en route home from last week&rsquo;s trip to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tourismbonaire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bonaire  </a> </u> , a Caribbean island off the coast of Venezuela, I stumbled across  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/\" target=\"_blank\">   Time magazine&rsquo;s  </a> </u>  article, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/3892050/american-summer-vacation/\" target=\"_blank\">   Save the American Vacation  </a> </u> .&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a new topic. This time last year,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/06/08/countries-most-vacation-days/2400193/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   USA Today  </a> </u>  ran a story on countries with the most vacation days, leading with this unfortunate fact:</p><p> &ldquo;The United States is the only developed country in the world without a single legally required paid vacation day or holiday. By law, every country in the European Union has at least four work weeks of paid vacation.&rdquo;</p><p> And we&rsquo;re not only behind the EU when it comes to vacation. We&rsquo;re behind every industrialized nation:</p><p> <img alt=\"b2ap3_thumbnail_no-vacation-nation-revisited-fig1-2014-04.jpg\" src=\"https://kleinadvisors.advisorproducts.com/images/easyblog_images/705/b2ap3_thumbnail_no-vacation-nation-revisited-fig1-2014-04.jpg\"/></p><h3> Clearly, America has bred a culture of non-vacation.</h3><p>  </p><p> And my own family was living proof. My dad was a business owner, so vacationing just wasn&rsquo;t something we did when I was growing up. Sure, I went away to summer camp, but we didn&rsquo;t plan getaways as a family. As a result, it took me until late in my adult life to finally begin to understand the importance of not only setting aside the time and money to take a vacation, but also how to actually benefit from the time I spend away from the office.</p><p> Last October, for the first time in a decade, I took a real vacation on my own. I went diving on the island of  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali\" target=\"_blank\">   Bali  </a> </u> , and I remember feeling uptight nearly the whole time. I wasn&rsquo;t able to turn off the constant vigilance and attention to detail that dominates my business-owner brain. If the internet at the hotel was down, I felt panicky. If plans fell through, I felt like I&rsquo;d failed. I stayed focused on the next item on the agenda and what I was &ldquo;missing&rdquo; at home. It wasn&rsquo;t until the very last day of the trip that I felt able to exhale and take in where I was, who I was with, and the sheer experience of what I was doing.</p><p> Earlier this year, I was diving in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/palau\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Palau  </a> </u>  with a wonderful dive master named Eddie. Before each dive, Eddie would say, &ldquo;Remember, diving is not swimming. Look up. Look down. Look around. And most importantly, have fun.&rdquo; It seems basic, yet most beginning divers are so focused on a destination&mdash;on the agenda&mdash;that they forget that the reason for being there isn&rsquo;t to achieve, but to simply let go. We spend most of our lives striving to do more, in school, at work, even in our social lives. But vacation is perhaps the one time we can truly forget about doing and just accept what happens day to day, moment to moment.</p><h3> So how do we get there?</h3><p> <br/> The Time article focuses on the need to take time for vacation, but clearly no government policy is going to help make that happen. Just like planning for retirement, it&rsquo;s up to each of us as individuals to actually make it happen, and that takes planning&mdash;for both time and money.</p><p> Decades ago, back when people actually walked into the bank building to make a deposit and we all had &ldquo;passbooks&rdquo; for our accounts, Vacation Clubs were popular. Basically a layaway plan for the holidays, some community banks and credit unions still offer this simple way to budget every month to prepay for your time off. According to surveys by Visa, AAA, and Money Magazine, most Americans spend about $1,600 on vacation (I&rsquo;m guessing that number is higher in Southern California). By saving just a little over $30 a week all year in a dedicated account, you could easily have at least the bulk of a vacation paid for. Then it&rsquo;s a matter of planning the actual time to get away, which for many of us is the biggest challenge of all. But by planning now, you will not only set yourself up for success, but you may also be able to completely let go once you do get there. The benefits? There are lots of studies that show regular vacations help reduce stress, increase creativity, and strengthen family relationships.</p><h3> No wonder all those other countries make it a top priority!</h3>",

    "content": "<p> Now that I await my next career pinnacle to begin with an innovative, forward thinking telecommunication company with a solid balance sheet and clear executive management direction (criteria I used when evaluating who I wanted to work for), I am better equipped to step back and think about Linked In clearly and objectively on its benefits as a professional.</p><p> <strong>  THE GOOD: </strong></p><li> <p>  <strong>   OLD   </strong>  Connections: with former colleagues, clients and managers that I otherwise may have lost touch with had I not signed up for Linked In. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   NEW  </strong>   Connections: with thought innovators, active Linked In participants who offer expertise, share knowledge for free WITHOUT trying to sell anything (an application, a trial, a software, a service, information); </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   RECOMMENDATIONS:  </strong>  I've been reminded about some of the good I've done in my career when past associates provide Recommendations. The most honorable being the ones who did it without any encouragement, or some of the ones who we faced and collaborated to overcome obstacles together. Reminding me that issues are often not self-induced, often requiring hard work, dividing and conquering, and a positive attitude. People remember how you handled it and fixed matters far longer than what the issues may have been to begin with. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   INFORMATION:   </strong>  Knowledge, learning and sharpening your skills are important in this fast changing world. What mattered yesterday is not what matters today. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   FOLLOW:  </strong>   Linked In makes it easy for you to \"FOLLOW\" companies or organizations that you are interested or involved in -- be it as a shareholder, investor, vendor, contributor. You can also \"FOLLOW\" those that inspire you or whom you would like to learn from -- Bill Gates, Richard Branson, to mention a couple that are obvious. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   ENTREPRENEURS:  </strong>   If you are a business owner you should be on top of what is impacting business today. Even if you are ready to cross it off as irrelevant to your own business (i.e. cloud, data or social media), you may want to be informed to avoid pitfalls you may unwillingly be falling into. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   SALES PROFESSIONALS:  </strong>  Linked In, to many sales professionals, is a contact grab and that is about it. Don't just use a name as a contact, title for your CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system to keep managers at bay or to accumulate names. You can benefit by \"Follow\"ing your customers/company for insight on what they are saying or sharing -- so that you can expand your insights and identify opportunities for what you are selling. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   WEB-I-NOMICS:  </strong>   Linked In is a cash cow of information that allows others to gain knowledge. You can curate valuable information for your website that inform and create conversations with your customers, vendors and prospects. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   EXPERTISE:  </strong>   Linked In features are continuously expanding and bringing value to its users. You can collaborate, curate, post, share information that eventually can signify your expertise on subject matters. You can write blog posts to expose your knowledge to draw advocates, followers, colleagues, managers, customers and vendors. Even sharing quotes, articles from third parties, can attract comments or shares that endorse the worthiness of what you are sharing. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   GROUPS:  </strong>   One of the first features I started using was joining a couple of groups that related to my career. They allowed me to participate in discussions, answer questions ... which tested my expertise, collaborated with others, .... or pose questions from others to provide input from the same industry or professional designation (i.e. Project Manager, Business Development, etc). I have made significant contacts that have brought tremendous growth, learning, mentoring and value. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   PRIVACY:  </strong>   You are in control of what others see about you because you personally create your profile. You can set your profile privacy to make it difficult for recruiters, spammers or serial sales people from pitching you (which can be annoying to some if not all). You can also see who has looked at your profile (as long as they don't set themselves as anonymous). </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   JOBS:  </strong>   If you are looking for work, Linked In is a superb repository of information on a variety of recruitment firms, looking up the person you may be interviewing with, connecting with those who may bridge an opportunity (i.e. referrals) look up a company, or link to website, etc. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   COMMUNICATE:   </strong>  You can make Linked In what you want it to be. You can reach out, touch base with your contacts. I like Linked In feature of letting me know who has a new job to congratulate them on, celebrating a work anniversary, or even acknowledging a birthday. You can control how you communicate and not disclose your personal email by restricting and staying within Linked In MESSAGES. It does allow you to check off if you don't mind sharing your personal email or as the next step in communications. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   PERSONALIZE:   </strong>  This profile is all about you! How rigid you are filling in the blanks may demonstrate just that. Give insight to your personality, whether it is gregarious or academic, think of your audience and what perception you want them to have. Use the summary if you're bursting with creativity. AND ... for heaven's sake, post a photo. I won't get into the selfies, because we all know if you are on this planet you have a phone with a camera. You may as well use it. Suffice to say, you may be a water skiing enthusiast or were the party favor at the last event, but this is not the place you want to showcase that. Photo finishing has diminished so those businesses offer photo taking services and will even have a scanned image that you can upload at a nominal fee -- think Passport photo with a smile -- smiling is never a bad idea if you want to appear friendly and approachable. </p></li><p> <strong>  THE BAD: </strong></p><li> <p>  <strong>   SELF-PROCLAIMED EXPERTS:  </strong>   There are so many \"Experts\" on Linked In my head spins at times. In fact, if someone states \"EXPERT\" on the profile, my first reaction is to think \"NOT!\". Ultimately, expertise is a label that others give you. It is often demonstrated by a lot of credible Recommendations from subject matter professionals. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   SELF-PROMOTION:   </strong>  If all you post is me, myself, I ... that is about all who is going to be reading what you post. Your connections will appreciate posts and shares that are interesting and relevant to a professional audience. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   ANONYMITY:  </strong>   Privacy protection and security are front and center in many people and company's minds. Therefore, they will set their privacy by default to remain anonymous. On the flip side, I'm not sure others feel the same way, lurking a profile under cover can be annoying to the recipient. In my opinion, being open also relays credibility. I am certain there are a variety of reasons why persons want to remain hidden, I'm just not a fan of this practice. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   COSTS:  </strong>   Nothing is ever free 100%. Linked In is accountable for its financials and creates nuggets to entice you to subscribe to additional features and benefits. At least it isn't hidden and you can see your options and determine what is best for you. Heck, you can probably write it off as a professional subscription or networking expense. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   ENDORSEMENTS:   </strong>  With the added feature of \"Endorsements\" comes questioning (to me anyhow) how important or how much weight others play on this feature. For example, if you have a lot of connections, you may not do business with them personally -- how can they truly attest to the skill being endorsed? The user selects the skills on their profile, which is flagged in front of their connections to endorse them. However, it is cool when an associate endorses you that you do know -- it can be a signal that they recognize that ability. The user can distinguish this, while the audience cannot. Alternatively, if someone endorses you, do you feel obliged to endorse them for something that you may not have professionally experienced? </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   AWARENESS:  </strong>   Linked In helps entrepreneurs, executives, employees and companies have presence on its pages. I'm amazed when I suggest to someone to get a profile up and they hesitate or avoid it altogether, citing the reason as privacy. In today's world, that is hardly an excuse but certainly it is everyone's prerogative. I also suggest that if you have a company or organization, create your Company Page. Don't assume either that since it is there that it should remain dormant. Like your website, keep it updated and relevant to the audience or customers you want to attract. If you are recruiting, use the job boards, search out potential candidates profiles, their links, comments, posts to get a feel for the person. The chances are they will be doing the same of you. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   BRANDING:  </strong>   Be on top of your brand, whether it is \"ME, INC.\" or a major named corporation. Monitor what people may be saying about your CEO, HR, executive, management or culture. It may start out as a minor squeak but could erupt into a public relations nightmare. Identify and acknowledge who is responsible for this. You'd be surprised how many people stray off topic in groups to give examples of poor treatment by a professional or company. Encourage your employees to be on Linked In, leverage it for the knowledge it presents, and champion subject matter expertise by participation. </p></li><p> <strong>  THE UGLY: </strong></p><li> <p>  <strong>   INVITATIONS:   </strong>  This is an area I've spoken to colleagues and associates about. It seems many are annoyed by invitations to connect from people \"out of the blue\" that they don't know. Again, this is something you can control. You can choose to ignore any invitations from parties unknown. I do suggest if you are compelled with the urge to connect with someone - send the invitation with an explanation as to why you would benefit (or better yet how they may) by connecting and exchanging information via posts. Personally, I professionally had my vision and goal to work for a specific company and searched who I perceived the hiring managers would be and sent an invitation. Lo and behold, this is the same company I will start working for at the end of August! I hardly think a company representative is going to blow you off. Everyone in every company is a customer service representative, whether they have it on their title or not! </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   MESSAGES:  </strong>   Theoretically, the only inbound messages you should get are from those that are a connection. However, Linked In offers a paid feature as part of subscription packages called IN-MAIL. The package you subscribe to determines the number of IN-MAIL messages you are allowed -- which are basically unsolicited messages from others. If you are a recruiter, in marketing or a social media advocate, you may have more connections than average. That can also lend itself to a larger number of virtual strangers messaging you. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   DATING:  </strong>   Linked In is not a dating site. Unfortunately, some boneheads do try to use it as a soft way of introducing themselves and approaching you if you inadvertently accepted the invitation under the umbrella of business networking. I hear ya ... but they can't seem to read the \"Married\" part of your profile. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   SOLICITATION:  </strong>   Even if you actively monitor who your contacts are or are selective, you will often find yourself a recipient of a message that solicits (or recommends) a service, software, product or site. Message to senders: This is not a wise way of prospecting, never mind cold calling a complete stranger. Use it as a tool to gather information, not send information. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   PRIVACY:  </strong>   You go through all that trouble of keeping your information private, being selective on who you network with then BAM! Some nerd (to be polite) sends out a group message and you find your name muddled in with a bunch of other people. Yes, pretty much everyone is shaking their head before X-ing you out of their connections after you disclosed their name. People can look up your connections but be respectful of that information. I advise you stay clear of group messaging. That's not networking anyhow, that is broadcasting. There is an appropriate feature that Linked In offers by telling you that you have a connection within a certain company that you can reach out to and request a referral. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   GRAMMAR:  </strong>   Some may wonder why I include this ... it should never get too old to continually remind people to check their spelling on their profiles -- you are promotingYOU and who you represent/work for and you owe everyone attention to detail. Even if it is just a comment, ensure that you use proper grammar and check for spelling ... heck, double check the spelling of the person's name if you are going to use it. (I have distinct spelling for my name and it is often misspelled). Run your summary or post through a Word software program and spell check it before uploading is a good idea. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   CLUTTER:  </strong>   As with any website that has experienced growth, you may have noticed Linked In has a lot going on your page when you visit. It uses intuitive software to predict who, what you should know, what you are interested in reading based on past clicks. There are far more article suggestions now that populate Linked In as they opened up the ability for anyone to post. The choices you make, the clicks you enter, and the time you spend on Linked In is your own individual preference. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   COMPETITION:  </strong>   There isn't much competition to Linked In on professional social networking, however, they are still competing for your attention while you are online. They will continue to navigate and update thus change is a given. They will continue to tempt you with subscription benefits in order to continue generating a revenue stream. I predict that what you see for free will eventually be eroded or what you want expanded upon charged for.   </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   AUTHORITY:   </strong>  As endorsements continually grow along with the number of people who are writing posts, it may be getting more confusing as to whom really has the authority on a topic. Linked In chooses a number of Followers you have on your Posts, so it is basically a numbers game. (I'm not sure how they do it, but I gather that it is a combination of your network number and how likely people are to read or share your posts and what that additional viewership entails). A higher profile is typically dependent on who you are (i.e. Bill Gates), how many followers you attract, or have the number of comments on your posts will indicate expertise based on those numbers. If you have a post that gains a lot of attention, it could be recommended by Linked In under its PULSE highlights. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   NEGATIVITY:  </strong>   You can see for yourself in groups or on posts. Sometimes, heated debates erupt or I think some people say silly things to get attention, albeit often negative. You are what you post, comment, write and it is your personal brand that you are impacting. Treat it genuinely and respectfully. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   MANNERS:  </strong>   Thank you are the two most powerful words in business, social media, Linked In, or anywhere. Be known for your manners. Be honest, be authentic. If someone compliments a post or shares it, thank them. Social media in all its glory boils down to \"if you scratch my back, I will scratch your's\". There are a number of examples, but one that maybe is not a right or realistic expectation .... if you notice you have a fan who continuously comments, compliments or shares your posts, recognize them by name and say \"Thank you\". If you can, even read some of their posts and comment or hit like if that is how you feel. </p></li><p> There you have it: the good, the bad and the ugly of Linked In. I'm sure there are a lot a great experiences along with a few nightmares. The bottom line is, it is a great repository of YOUR career information. Think of it as a tool. How well it works for you is how attuned you are.</p><p> \"I destroy my enemies when I make them my friends.\" ~Abraham Lincoln</p>",

    "content": "<p> Being saddled with student loan debt can feel like an enormous burden. Many millennials are holding themselves back in life because they&rsquo;re struggling to afford their minimum payments along with trying to save for everything else in life.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re in this situation, there&rsquo;s a way out. While plenty of young adults are dealing with student loan debt, many more are successfully paying them off. Not sure how to create a plan to pay down your student loans? Start here.</p><h3> Saving vs Paying Off Debt</h3><p> <br/> Chances are you know  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/cost-of-waiting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   saving your money  </a> </u>  is just as important as  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/tackle-your-debt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   paying off your debt  </a> </u> . But how do you know how much to save? Or what you should be saving for? Or how to save and pay off your debt? It can be difficult to prioritize.</p><p> You should put creating a cash cushion of about $1000 at the top of your financial to-do list. A small  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/stop-living-paycheck-to-paycheck/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   emergency fund  </a> </u>  can help you get through unexpected situations without pushing you further into debt.</p><p> What if you have bigger goals? Look at the big picture. The standard repayment period on student loans is 10 years &mdash; you probably don&rsquo;t want to wait that long to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/saving-down-payment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   save for a house  </a> </u>  or for a wedding.</p><p> You need to find a way to balance paying off your student loans with saving, if that&rsquo;s the case. You can re-evaluate your budget to see if you can cut any costs or lessen some expenses. Be critical about what&rsquo;s truly a need, and what falls under the &ldquo;wants&rdquo; category.</p><p> If you have multiple goals along with paying down student debt, you can also  start earning extra money to fund savings with a separate income stream. This allows you to make progress in a number of areas, instead of being limited to just one financial priority.</p><p> (And yes, you can earn more money! You can start by  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/4-steps-for-negotiating-your-next-pay-raise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   negotiating for what you&rsquo;re worth  </a> </u>  at your current job &mdash; or even consider looking for new positions that pay better. You can also take the initiative to start a side gig in your free time to earn a little extra.)</p><h3> What Are Your Interest Rates?</h3><p> <br/> Your interest rate is a percentage charged when you borrow money. The higher your interest rate, the more money you&rsquo;re paying to borrow money. Additionally, the longer your repayment term (again, the standard is 10 years for student loans), the more you&rsquo;ll end up paying over the life of the loan.</p><p> It&rsquo;s worth noting some people believe in paying the minimum if your interest rates are around 2.2% or lower. This is because  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-much-do-i-need-to-invest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   saving and investing your money  </a> </u>  will get you a better return on your money. (That&rsquo;s assuming you actually save it, though!)</p><p> If your interest rates are on the higher end &mdash; around 5% or more &mdash; you might want to prioritize paying them off. You don&rsquo;t want to pay more money toward interest if you don&rsquo;t have to.</p><h3> Making Extra Payments</h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s where making extra payments comes into play. The more you can pay toward your student loans, the less you&rsquo;ll be paying toward interest. This allows you to chip away at the principal balance of your loan.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to pay extra all the time, or only during your regular payment, either. Pay more when you can, even if it&rsquo;s just once or twice a year.</p><h3> Options Available If You Can&rsquo;t Afford Payments</h3><p> <br/> There are several thousand graduates out there with six-figures in student loan debt with no way to repay it. If you&rsquo;re stressing about affording your student loan payments, there  are a few options to consider.</p><p> If you have federal loans, there are many  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/whats-the-best-options-for-student-loan-repayment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   flexible income-based repayment options  </a> </u>  available to you. Call up your loan servicer and explain the situation you&rsquo;re in. They might be able to recommend a specific repayment plan to look into.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans\" target=\"_blank\">   Federal Student Aid  </a> </u>  has a guide on what repayment plans are available, and what it takes to qualify for them. Additionally, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance if you&rsquo;re experiencing financial hardship.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re struggling to make payments on your loans, you may be eligible for deferment, which is a temporary period where you don&rsquo;t have to make payments, and interest doesn&rsquo;t accrue on subsidized loans. Interest does accrue on unsubsidized loans. Forbearance is similar to deferment, except interest continues accruing on all of your loans during the time you don&rsquo;t have to make payments.</p><p> Not having to make payments gives you a chance to get back on your feet and to begin managing your cashflow better.</p><p> Getting your loans forgiven, discharged, or canceled is possible, but only in select circumstances. (Again, see  <u>  <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation\" target=\"_blank\">   Federal Student Aid  </a> </u>  for an overview of those circumstances.) These options mean you no longer owe anything on your student loans.</p><p> What if you have private loans? They don&rsquo;t come with the variety of repayment plans federal loans do, but many lenders are willing to work with borrowers by granting them forbearance periods. If you need help, pick up the phone and call your loan servicer and see what they can do for you.</p><p> Refinancing or consolidating are two options to look into as well. The purpose of refinancing your student loans is to improve your terms (to lower your interest rate, for example). The purpose of consolidating your loans is to make it easier to pay them. If you owe money to 7 different lenders, consolidating them rolls them all into one easy payment. You can do both with federal loans, too.</p><h3> Steps to Paying Down Student Loans</h3><p> <br/> Now that you&rsquo;re armed with some essential knowledge on student loans, it&rsquo;s time to talk about how to get rid of them.</p><p> <strong>  Look at Your Entire Financial Situation: </strong>  Do you have any other debt? What&rsquo;s your salary? How much can you afford to pay toward your student loans? These are all things you need to get clear on to formulate a plan of attack on your loans.</p><p> <strong>  Start Budgeting and Tracking Your Expenses:  </strong> That&rsquo;s where  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/back-to-basics-with-the-b-word/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   budgeting and tracking your expenses  </a> </u>  comes in. You need to know where your money is going, and how you&rsquo;re using it. This is especially true if you&rsquo;re finding you don&rsquo;t have enough money to last you a month.</p><p> <strong>  Evaluate Your Expenses: </strong>  After you&rsquo;ve established your budget and have an idea of how much you&rsquo;ve been spending and where, go back and evaluate your expenses. Question how much value you&rsquo;re getting out of things. If paying down your student loans is your top priority, you need to make room for extra payments in your budget.</p><p> <strong>  Focus on Earning More Money: </strong>  If you&rsquo;ve cut back on all your expenses, and are still struggling to make payments or find room in your budget for basic needs, try earning more money. You can work overtime at your job, take on additional shifts, or get a second job.</p><p> Having trouble finding employment? Many individuals are making their own jobs based off of hobbies or skills they have. Do you enjoy pet-sitting, babysitting, crafting, consulting, freelancing, or organizing? Advertise your services and get the word out.</p><p> <strong>  Have a Plan and Follow It: </strong>  Paying your student loans off is going to be a long journey. It&rsquo;s important to have a plan to refer back to when times get tough. Choose exactly how you&rsquo;re going to pay off your debt. Pick one loan out from the rest and singularly focus on paying it down, while paying the minimum on the rest. This one loan might be the loan with the highest interest rate, the lowest balance, or one you just want to see gone.</p><p> <strong>  Stay Hopeful: </strong>  Remember, paying off debt can be a difficult journey filled with ups and downs. It&rsquo;s important to build a support system and stay hopeful when you hit a roadblock. Surround yourself with friends who can relate to what you&rsquo;re going through, and stick with people who help you  <u>  achieve your goals </u> .</p><p> By following these six steps, you&rsquo;ll be on a clearer path to paying down your student loans. Don&rsquo;t get discouraged; there are plenty of options available to you if you&rsquo;re experiencing difficulty paying your loans back. The worst thing you can do is not make any payments. Always reach out to your loan servicer to see if they can help you out.</p><p> Stay focused, determined, and hold yourself accountable. Don&rsquo;t let your student loans own you &mdash; own them instead.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Dean had a tendency to dominate every meeting or briefing he attended. As a supervisor, he surrounded himself with other like-minded male FBI agents who frequently ignored, dismissed, or interrupted others whose opinion they did not respect. </strong></p><p> As a woman I was tired of not getting my voice heard in meetings where louder voices drowned out what I had to say. How could I change the behavior of leadership?</p><p> When I looked around the room, I saw that Dean and others of his ilk were also ignoring some of the other male agents who did not stand out as exceptional performers or leaders. While being a female agent may have had some impact on their behavior toward me, <strong>  it clearly was also a matter of who was perceived to have anything important to say.  </strong>  Here is how I used  <a href=\"/category/personal-development\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  mental toughness </a>  to get my voice heard:</p><h3> 1. Find Something Positive&mdash;Even if You Have to Look Really, Really Hard</h3><p> <br/> I had my list of complaints about Dean, but now was the time to focus on the positive aspects of the supervisor, not his faults. For every 1 negative trait, I looked for and found, 5 positive traits about him. As a former U.S. Marine, he was:</p><li> Disciplined and conscientious</li><li> Possessed clarity of purpose</li><li> Used humor to defray tension</li><li> Relied upon a high standard of integrity to guide his decisions.</li><li> Loyal to his friends <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Use <u>  Emotional Intelligence </u>  </h3><p> <br/> Emotional intelligence is being savvy about the what is important to not only ourselves, but others as well. Awareness is being alert and honest about my feelings of frustration and disappointment that I felt when ignored by Dean and others like him.</p><p> Mental toughness is letting go of our ego after we&rsquo;ve acknowledged our feelings and focusing our attention on someone else instead of ourselves.</p><p> When I focused on Dean, I identified one characteristic that seemed to dominate every decision he ever made&mdash;integrity. If I wanted to get my voice heard, I needed to appeal to his sense of integrity, not his sense of equal opportunity.</p><h3> 3. Network Strategically</h3><p> <br/> There is a saying: if you can&rsquo;t beat them, join them. While collaboration is increasingly important,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the silo mentality  </a> </u>  has arisen for a reason: people naturally tend to form safe tribes with colleagues and avoid those they don&rsquo;t know well. This is because collaboration with people they don&rsquo;t know is a threat to their brain. </p><p> The emotional limbic brain is survival-driven, and it tends to trust those with whom we&rsquo;ve developed close ties or have shared experiences. </p><p> I intentionally sought out Dean, and his buddies, to ask for advice about my cases.  <strong>  I buried my pride and made them partners in the direction I took my investigations. </strong>  Since Dean and his friends had developed deep relationships, I suspected they would talk about me in my absence, and I wanted those conversations to be complimentary and positive.</p><h3> 4. Watch Body Language</h3><p> <br/> Our emotional limbic brain system leaks all sorts of information through  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061438294/?tag=mh0b-20&amp;hvadid=3522228843&amp;ref=pd_sl_3wc6yfroq8_b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   body language  </a> </u> . When I approached Dean, his eyebrows arched, indicating a genuine feeling of warmth at seeing me. Few people notice this, but an &ldquo;eyebrow flash&rdquo; is an automatic reaction when you see someone you like.</p><p> Smiling is a sign of submission, which is why many dominant individuals don&rsquo;t smile. Dean always smiled when he saw me, however, and it was a genuine smile&mdash;there were crow&rsquo;s feet and the cheeks were pushed up.</p><p> Perhaps more importantly, is how he didn&rsquo;t react the same way to others. What was it about them that did not generate warm feelings? It was then that I realized none of them were the first to smile at Dean. They were so focused on being seen by leadership as serious professionals that they lost their ability to smile and have a good time, especially the women who wanted to come across as tough.</p><p> Smiling activates our mirror neurons;  <strong>  our brain sees a reaction in someone else and it wants to mirror those same emotions. </strong>  I always approached Dean with a smile, and he naturally wanted to smile back.</p><h3> 5. Make Pithy, Strong Statements</h3><p> <br/> Dean was a busy guy and very quick witted. I didn&rsquo;t dawdle when chatting about a case&mdash;I came straight to the point with pithy, strong statements. I didn&rsquo;t waste his time by trying to ingratiate myself in a way that he would not appreciate. </p><p> In our next meeting, the discussion circled around to a topic that Dean and I had previously discussed. He knew he could rely on me to be succinct and make an impact, so he asked for my opinion. I didn&rsquo;t let him down&mdash; <strong>  I made my statement and then shut up, not using this opportunity to make sure everyone else in the room knew how competent I was.  </strong></p><p> That day was a turning point. While I have never developed a loud voice, I have developed a strong one.</p><p> That is something you can do as well. Use it well.</p><p> What suggestions do you have to make your voice heard when in a room with louder ones?</p>",

And if we&rsquo;ve got our goals aligned, then it&rsquo;s all about making our fans and followers loveeeee us.</p><p> Social media platforms are just like real life. They&rsquo;re like roomfuls of people hanging out and waiting to interact, be educated, and given things.</p><p> By not treating online relationships like we do in our everyday, we&rsquo;re doing a great disservice to those who take the time to follow us, and to our biz. If you think there&rsquo;s a disconnect between the online and real world, you&rsquo;re mistaken!</p><p> So I&rsquo;m here to help you get in line and start dating your fabulous audience! It&rsquo;s time we woo them, do all the right things, and turn them into an adoring audience excited to hear from us.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s 5 ways to make your fans fall in love on social media!</p><h3> 1. Show your appreciate (Say thank you)</h3><p> <br/> If we do something for someone we care about and they don&rsquo;t say thank you &ndash; what happens? We&rsquo;re a bit sad, maybe even hurt!</p><p> The same reaction occurs on social media. The people (no matter how much cooler or famous-er than me) who have taken the time to say thank you to me over the years have been the ones who gained my admiration and inevitable my friendship.</p><p> In fact, basically all of the relationships I&rsquo;ve developed online began with a simple thank you! That&rsquo;s powerful.</p><p> Personally, I think showing and expressing thanks is one of the greatest things we can do for our online communities. It softens people&rsquo;s hearts, it grows relationships, and it keeps our ego in check.</p><p> Take the time to say thank you &ndash; thank people for commenting on your Facebook page (even if they&rsquo;re promoting), thank fellow tweeters when they share your content, thank folks for commenting on your blog &ndash; thank people for everything that you can.</p><p> Thank, thank, thank!</p><p> Disclaimer: Recently there has been a rise is automated thanks &ndash; do NOT partake in this activity. If you get to the point where you need to automate your gratitude on social media, then something is wrong. Automation was created to allow marketers and social business owners to have MORE time to interact, engage and thank people. It wasn&rsquo;t made to automate the core parts of what make social so wonderful. Hire someone, slow down &ndash; but don&rsquo;t fall prey to automated responses. The deal is, you might get by with one, but people are smart, and when they realize what&rsquo;s going on &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be SO dumped! Not worth it.</p><h3> 2. Make them feel like they&rsquo;re the only one</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s be honest &ndash; we all like to feel special by the one we love. We like to be taken care of, adored, and treated as if we&rsquo;re the only one in the world.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t admit it &ndash; I will!</p><p> These needs expands to social media. Our fans and followers want to feel significant, and why shouldn&rsquo;t they? I bet when you&rsquo;re a consumer, you&rsquo;re looking for the same thing.</p><p> In 2015, the ability to personalize and give people individual attention is going to be a defining trait for successful businesses. The brands who take the time to answer people/issues on Twitter, the businesses who ALWAYS reply on Facebook, the ones who respond on Instagram &ndash; these folks are going to super successful because it&rsquo;s what the public wants!</p><p> So how are you going to do it? My first advice is to approach your social media communication from the user&rsquo;s point of view. If you stick to a business mindset then you&rsquo;ll miss out on several ways to please people and turn them into worshipping fans &ndash; not because you&rsquo;re terrible at social, but because you&rsquo;re missing what&rsquo;s most important &ndash; their point of view.</p><p> Once you begin approaching social from a different angle your entire strategy is going to experience a complete renewal.</p><p> Use names when replying on Twitter, ask new followers a question about something in their bios, take the time to go through their Instagram feed and like/comment on a few pictures, or offer unique solutions on Facebook.</p><p> Approach your social media audience as you would a new relationship and consider how you can make them feel special.</p><h3> 3. Be entertaining</h3><p> <br/> Who likes to date the dude who sits on the couch all night or the girl who does nothing but talk? These are stereotypes, but we&rsquo;ve all been privy to these folks, and we know what it&rsquo;s like &ndash; borrrrrrrrring.</p><p> Just like dating in real life, we&rsquo;ve got to entertain our audience to make them fall in love with us! We can just upload stuff and walk away &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got to research and compile fantastic content, start conversations, show our appreciation, share other people&rsquo;s content, and entertain the folks who follow us around.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve asked my audiences more than once what the number one reason is for unfollowing someone online and it&rsquo;s always the same &ndash; being bored.</p><p> If we don&rsquo;t put time and effort into appeasing our fans and followers then we won&rsquo;t ever win over their hearts.</p><p> Think about it &ndash; what does a business/person need to do to win you over? Go overboard &ndash; believe me, you&rsquo;ll be one of the few.</p><h3> 4. Tickle their funny bone</h3><p> <br/> A great sense of humor has me every. single. time. Make me laugh and I might be yours forever!</p><p> And I&rsquo;m not the only one.</p><p> People love to laugh, in fact &ndash; they need it, desperately. Turn on the TV, read the news or consider all the stuff we deal with everyday! We all need a good laugh.</p><p> Social platforms became so popular because they&rsquo;re an outlet to everyday life &ndash; we kick back with our family and friends, read up on things we&rsquo;re interested in, and click play on a few videos that make us feel all warm and fuzzy. But we&rsquo;re always on the hunt for the content that cracks us up!</p><p> In the midst of planning your social strategy, make sure you include humorous articles, photos, and videos. Go the extra mile and joke with people lightly, find ways to make them smile, and be playful.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no room for total seriousness in social media. While some folks are of the opinion that humor isn&rsquo;t for every industry &ndash; I disagree. Laughter is medicine and everything has a soft spot that can be laughed at &ndash; yes, even lawyers.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re concerned with how to joke around &ndash; do some research! Look up competitors or other businesses in your industry and see what&rsquo;s getting good reactions from their audience. Or go out on a limb and try your own.</p><p> I can be a very serious person when it comes to business, but by sharing my quirky, goofy side with my online audiences, it&rsquo;s allowed me to create wonderful relationships.</p><h3> 5. Add beautiful value</h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;ve heard it before, and I&rsquo;m saying it again &ndash; value is key.</p><p> You won&rsquo;t date someone who isn&rsquo;t bringing something additional to your life, so don&rsquo;t expect your audience to be awed by your brand when you&rsquo;re giving them nothing in return.</p><p> Add value to the lives of your followers and they will endear themselves to you for a long, long time. Share articles that solve their issues, answer and ask questions, give them free tools and information, upload educational videos, and offer infographics packed with tips.</p><p> There&rsquo;s so many ways we can add value to our online audiences, but it all comes down to content and personal contact. What are you sharing? Are you sharing with purpose? Are you scheduling out content that will enhance their lives or just add to it?</p><p> Be mindful of what you share, how you engage, and the solutions offered.</p><h3> How do you make your social communities fall in love with your brand?</h3>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s that time of year again when summer reading lists come out. I&rsquo;ve never put out a summer reading list, so this will be my very first one. In thinking through the titles I should include on my list, I found myself getting more and more excited. Content creation is more important than ever and the very best writers read, a lot. To appeal to your target audience these days, you have to be a master storyteller and really appeal to your audience. What better way to improve your storytelling abilities than by brushing up on classics alongside modern day marketing thought leadership?!</p><p> Over the weekend, I reflected on all the written works that have moved me, inspired me, taught me and grew me from the inside out. Plenty of these works are well-known, maybe you even read them once upon a time, and others you may have heard of and just haven&rsquo;t read yet. I encourage you to pick up some of these titles for an experience that will expand your mind, challenge your perspectives and prepare you for great marketing that will matter to your audience.</p><p> In no particular order, here is my hand-picked selection of titles for summer reading:</p><p> <img alt=\"on the road\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/on-the-road-193x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  1. On the Road by Jack Kerouac </strong></p><p> Entrepreneurs, Americans everywhere&hellip; if you haven&rsquo;t read this one, I highly recommend it. We all take a journey and we rarely know where we&rsquo;ll end up. If you can&rsquo;t go on your own road trip this summer, join Sal and Dean on theirs!</p><p> <img alt=\"look homeward angel\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/look-homeward-angel-199x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  2. Look Homeward, Angel by Thomas Wolfe </strong></p><p> Talk about poetic prose. Everyone&rsquo;s life tells a story and Thomas Wolfe shares his through his first novel. You can learn a lot about the art of crafting your own story through the hailed writings of Mr. Wolfe.</p><p> Each of us is all the sums he has not counted: subtract us into nakedness and night again, and you shall see begin in Crete four thousand years ago the love that ended yesterday in Texas. . . Each moment is the fruit of forty thousand years. The minute-winning days, like flies, buzz home to death, and every moment is a window on all time. This is a moment. <br/> <img alt=\"pride and prejudice\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pride-and-prejudice-199x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  3. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen </strong></p><p> Admittedly, I love 19th Century texts. Whether you are a romantic or not, that&rsquo;s not why you should or shouldn&rsquo;t read Jane Austen. Her storytelling is magnificent and her ability to underscore important social and political debates of her time period through character relationships is both genius and inspiring.</p><p> <img alt=\"the tipping point\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-tipping-point-195x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  4. The Tipping Point by Malcom Gladwell </strong></p><p> The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.</p><p> <img alt=\"contagious\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contagious-199x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  5. Contagious: Why Things Catch On by Jonah Berger </strong></p><p> Named the bestselling marketing book of 2014, this is a must-read to better understand why certain things catch on and become so popular among people. The human psychology behind how and why people share certain information is mind-bending.</p><p> <img alt=\"youtility\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/youtility-199x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  6. Youtility by Jay Baer </strong></p><p> A novel concept introduced that challenges marketers and businesses from selling to helping their customers by providing so much value that people will actually want to pay for it. &ldquo;Help not Hype&rdquo; is the theme of this industry-changing contribution to the world of marketing and business.</p><p> <img alt=\"for whom the bells toll\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/for-whom-the-bells-toll-200x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  7. For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemmingway  </strong></p><p> Who doesn&rsquo;t love Hemmingway? Telling a great story is both an art and a science. Telling a story from your brand&rsquo;s perspective in a way that will resonate and that others will be able to relate to is a real gift to have. Spend time with the ultimate influencer when it comes to storytelling so you can get it right.</p><p> <img alt=\"crime and punishment\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/crime-and-punishment-187x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  8. Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1866) </strong></p><p> I actually read this one cover to cover twice. Never has a work taken the reader so far within the mind of a character. Reading this book is like living through a deep psychological conflict that begs everyone to think introspectively about our own boundaries for when the ends justify the means. To learn how to be this honest and reflective in one&rsquo;s own life is invaluable in life and in business.</p><p> <img alt=\"of mice and men\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/of-mice-and-men-218x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  9. Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck (1937) </strong></p><p> Perhaps one of the greatest books of all time that encapsulates the true American hustle of an unlikely pairing. This was likely a required reading when you were growing up, but I urge you to read it again by choice.</p><p> <img alt=\"everybody writes\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/everybody-writes-203x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  10. Everybody Writes by Ann Handley </strong></p><p> The book&rsquo;s promotion says it better than I can myself, &ldquo;Everybody Writes is your go-to guide to creating ridiculously good content that attracts and retains customers. Because in today&rsquo;s content-driven world, writing matters more&hellip; not less.&rdquo; Need I justify why you need to read this book any further?</p><p> <img alt=\"influence\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/influence-204x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  11: Influence by Robert Cialdni </strong></p><p> We&rsquo;re all in business and need to make a living. Understanding why people say, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is helpful knowledge to have! Everyone needs to know how to sell, especially marketers.</p><p> <img alt=\"walden\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/walden-210x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  12. Walden by Henry David Thoreau (1845) </strong></p><p> Today, many of us feel the need to unplug from social media and escape the busy-ness of our lives. Thoreau felt the same way back in the 19th Century and I think this is an excellent work to reflect on for anyone who is looking for some sanctuary from the ever-increasing distractions of our media-driven lives.</p><p> <img alt=\"civil disobedience\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/civil-disobedience-187x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  13. Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau </strong></p><p> Truly a work that challenges all of us to stand for something. Apathy for issues outside of one&rsquo;s immediate attention is a real problem and the same was true back in 1848 when Thoreau was fed up with the population&rsquo;s inaction against unfair laws. This work had a profound effect on the actions of men and women during his time period. Every great piece of marketing should motivate its audience to action. That&rsquo;s why you need to read this work as an example of one very famous, &ldquo;call to action&rdquo; in American history.</p><p> <img alt=\"culture and anarchy\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/culture-and-anarchy-194x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  14. Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold </strong></p><p> If you want change. If you want to redefine a status quo. If you want to put an original spin on a timeless idea&hellip;. this work is like the surgeon&rsquo;s handbook for such a feat. Definitely a mind-bender of Western intellectual tradition that can be applied to any culture, any government, during any time period. It may not be an easy text, but it&rsquo;s certainly an important one well worth the challenge. It&rsquo;s also good if you read in groups so you can discuss.</p><p> <img alt=\"vindication\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vindication-205x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  15. A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft </strong></p><p> Unless you studied in English or Women&rsquo;s Studies, you may have never heard of this significant work. It&rsquo;s one of the very first, written by a woman, during and about patriarchal attitudes in the 18th Century. It is a cornerstone text on equality that is masterfully articulated. It was the &ldquo;Lean In&rdquo; of its time period and does a great job in defending its position.</p><p> <img alt=\"tell tale heart\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tell-tale-heart-182x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  16. The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe </strong></p><p> Most have probably read this one. Even if you don&rsquo;t remember the exact plot, you probably remember how it made you feel. That&rsquo;s why you should read this classic by Poe. Works that leave an emotional impression are memorable. How might you help your audience experience something memorable when they read your business&rsquo;s content (without being disturbing of course)?</p><p> <img alt=\"purpose\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/purpose-192x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  17. The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren </strong></p><p> Do you know what your purpose is? This Christian-based bestselling devotional makes the list, because it begs the questions we all should be asking of ourselves as individuals. It is also the question you need to be asking about your business and your marketing. No matter what, we all must be able to clearly answer the important question of &ldquo;why.&rdquo; You may avoid it in your life, but you know your marketing always needs to offer a crystal clear answer.</p><p> <img alt=\"cure for commonlife\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cure-for-commonlife-209x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  18. Cure for the Common Life by Max Lucado </strong></p><p> This text explores and identifies your own uniqueness, motivation to put your strengths to work, and the perfect prescription for finding and living in your sweet spot for the rest of your life. Great personal branding hinges on clarity around these important themes and this has been more insightful to me personally than many of the &ldquo;personal branding&rdquo; books I&rsquo;ve read.</p><p> <img alt=\"invisible man\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/invisible-man-185x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  19. The Invisible Man by HG Wells </strong></p><p> Classic science fiction. I had to include at least one from this genre. Creating new ideas and then convincing others of your new ideas isn&rsquo;t easy. Science fiction and fantasy have a way of creating whole worlds and things and situations that have never existed. Don&rsquo;t forget to flex your own imagination. It is uniquely human and can be wildly beneficial in business.</p><p> <img alt=\"huckleberry finn\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/huckleberry-finn-191x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  20. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain </strong></p><p> A well-known American classic that does a great job representing how to truly know and speak to your audience. One of the first novels to be written in vernacular English, it expresses a deep understanding of the characters and life situations it is writing about. The best brands can channel the voices of their audience. That is why this novel makes my list.</p><p> <img alt=\"the scarlett letter\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-scarlett-letter-186x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  21. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne </strong></p><p> Symbolism is powerful and memorable. You may not remember the entire plot of this famous novel, but I guarantee you remember the scarlet letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; the protagonist bore throughout this classic. Marketers use symbols all the time to represent our brand, product, service, idea, solution, etc. This novel is a great reminder of how to master the use of symbolism.</p><p> <img alt=\"crucible\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/crucible-201x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  22. The Crucible by Arthur Miller </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Because it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life! Because I lie and sign myself to lies! Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang! How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name!&rdquo;  Need I say more? How important is your brand&rsquo;s reputation to you?</p><p> <img alt=\"white noise\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/white-noise-208x300.png\"/> <br/> <strong>  23. White Noise by Don Delillo </strong></p><p> Rampant consumerism, media saturation, novelty academic intellectualism, underground conspiracies, the disintegration and reintegration of the family, human-made disasters, and the potentially regenerative nature of human violence&hellip;. what&rsquo;s not to love? It&rsquo;s witty and ironic, and quite darkly hilarious. I can appreciate the unique perspective it offers of the culture we&rsquo;ve created.</p><p> Phew. My list grew quite long and I even removed some titles. The bottom line is that I recommend you read works this summer that grow you and challenge you in some way. This is a list I hold near and dear to my heart and hope you enjoy them as much as I do.</p><p> Cheers!</p>",

    "content": "<p> In a research conducted by the University of Derby on the effects of smartphone addiction, it was concluded that the more a person uses his or her phone, the more likely they are to become addicted. The participants in the study spent around 3.6 hours a day on their phone, and 13% of them claimed to be addicted to their devices. So, does spending a lot of time using a smartphone make you unproductive?</p><h3> Effects of Too Much Smartphone or Social Media Usage</h3><p> <br/> Since social media is easily accessible through smartphones, it doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that more and more people are spending many hours on their phones. They don&rsquo;t realize, however, that excessive smartphone or social media usage is costing them not only their time. According to several studies, using your smartphhone too much can steal your personal happiness, halt children&rsquo;s development, and also decrease academic potential among students.</p><p> There were other research studies that proved that using Facebook for long periods of time can lead to increased feelings of loneliness. What&rsquo;s more, using your smartphone excessively can result to you getting many tasks undone.</p><p> <strong>  Here are some suggestions on how you can spend less time on your phone: </strong></p><h3> 1. Turn off any notifications</h3><p> <br/> Do you sometimes intend to check a notification and end up browsing the internet for almost half an hour? If that&rsquo;s the case, you are not alone. This happens to so many people, and it just proves that it is too easy to get stuck into the world of social media.</p><p> What you can do is to turn off your unnecessary notifications. You may also mute the audio alerts on your phone so that you don&rsquo;t get too many reasons to check your phone.</p><h3> 2. Know how much you are using your phone</h3><p> <br/> It may be difficult for you to willingly reduce your cell phone time simply because you&rsquo;re not aware of how much time you are spending on it every single day. There are several apps you can use to keep track of your phone usage. These apps will let you know how much of your time is wasted every time you hold your smartphone. Plus, these apps can also alert you if you&rsquo;re already using your phone too much.</p><h3> 3. Have the discipline to be phone-free periods each day</h3><p> <br/> There is no need for a phone at the bathroom, the dining table or while you&rsquo;re watching TV, so you don&rsquo;t actually have to have your phone in your hands. If you really want to boost your productivity by spending less time on your smartphone, you should determine only when you can use your phone. When you do this, there is a good chance that you will be spending more time with your family and for yourself.</p><h3> 4. Find other interesting thing to do during your spare time</h3><p> <br/> Smartphones come with so many apps and games that can keep you entertained for as many hours as you want. Instead of playing those games, why not do something else that requires physical or mental activity? You may go to the gym if you have time, or you can read books as well. The thing is, these things will keep you busy and will also be beneficial to your overall wellbeing.</p><p> When it comes to being productive, it actually is a choice that you make for yourself. You can&rsquo;t blame technology for your inability to complete your tasks, because it is you who decide to waste time using your gadgets. Besides, if you are aspiring for a higher position in the near future, you might as well  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/mentor-program-details/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   hone your leadership skills  </a> </u>  by taking control of your bad habits.</p>",

An age where we can mistake likes, retweets, backlinks, and comments for validation of our content and ourselves. It&rsquo;s not that social media is a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination, just that as an author or thought leader you can fall prey to allowing the culture of likes and such to influence your content at the expense of insight.</p><p> Insight and wisdom will never go out of style and will not be diluted by Instagram or Vine. You are a thought leader and while you may need to tweak your voice to be heard above the noise, you cannot fall prey to a social media strategy that develops content with the sole intent of generating likes and being &ldquo;popular.&rdquo; Insight and likes are not mutually exclusive. In fact, content that is thought provoking, that has a direct business application, that can drive behavior change, and that leads to measurable results is very &ldquo;like-able.&rdquo;</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t be tempted to dumb down your work to make it more &ldquo;social&rdquo; friendly.</h3><p> <br/> Instead, expand your social media strategy. Experiment with the new platforms and formats. You may be a master at writing powerful 2500 word articles, a world class keynote speaker, or a globally admired academic who&rsquo;s published in countless journals. That means you are a thought leader, that your work has value. What you&rsquo;ll need to figure out is how to master these new mediums to expand your reach. I&rsquo;m not suggesting you start taking silly selfies, but to discover a way to impart your wisdom and insight into shorter formats. Formats that are more visual, formats that are consumed via mobile devices as opposed to traditional print.</p><p> We live in an age that is changing rapidly for authors, speakers, and thought leaders. The models that worked for decades are no longer valid. They haven&rsquo;t taken a hiatus, they&rsquo;ve gone extinct.</p><h3> Stay relevant&mdash;try new formats and models. </h3><p> <br/> Content by its very nature is dynamic and fluid; if you let it take new shapes and forms you can convey wisdom and insight to new populations&mdash;to a new generation. It&rsquo;s on you to have the courage to push your work into new formats and to do so in a way that doesn&rsquo;t dilute it to pithy and hollow phrases. You can be insightful, get retweeted, and be liked but it will take effort and it will require you to be thoughtful in your approach to being a thought leader in the social age.</p> ",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Working with boutique ETF issuers, index providers, white label platforms, asset managers turned ETF sponsors, ETF managed portfolio strategists and RIAs that invest solely with ETFs, we've seen and heard from a wide range of the players in the business.  Just about everyone wants to know how they can make their PR and marketing efforts a success. </p><p> Whether we are brainstorming blog post ideas, coming up with messaging points around a new product or prepping a client for their next TV appearance, we are constantly challenging ourselves and our clients to articulate what makes the story different. The surge in popularity of ETFs and the increasing number of new products and new issuers coming to market has made it increasingly difficult to stand out without the right marketing approach.</p><p> But, the success of one product that we helped launch in November 2014 is instructive for the overall outlook for the ETF business and new products coming to market.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pureetfs.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PureFunds  </a> </u> , in conjunction with ISE ETF Ventures, launched the first - and currently only - cyber security ETF.  The product's ticker, HACK, earned the distinction for \"ticker of the year\" from ETF.com.  But, it was the ETF's direct focus on an unexploited segment of the market that made it primed for success. Cyber security, as well all know, has become a frontline issue for businesses, governments and individuals as information thefts, cyber attacks and digital criminals have become routine in our headlines for nearly 18 months.</p><p> Students of marketing will tell you that the success of marketing depends on the \"4 P's\" -- product, place, promotion, price.  Bringing an innovative product to market that is built on a fundamentally index or investment thesis is critical for a successful launch.  What is the ETF or ETP supposed to do? Is it pure exposure to a sector? Is it a rising interest rate defensive play? Is it supposed to provide income during periods of market volatility?  That needs to be defined.   In the case of HACK, the purpose of the product was obvious and clear from the out.</p><h3> As for place, there has never been a better time to bring a quality ETF to market.</h3><p> <br/> Certainly, there is a lot of noise and competing products.  But, in the ever-competitive world of keeping assets under management, ETF portfolio strategists, RIAs and broker-dealers all are looking for the best ideas for bringing clients desired market exposure at the lowest price.</p><p> The issue of price, in marketing an ETF or exchange-traded product, comes down to the product construction.  As a rules-based or index product, the issuer can provide exposure to growth at a fraction of the price an investor would have to pay an active manager. Here, the ETF still wins.</p><p> The final \"P\" is promotion and this is where the marketplace receptivity for a new ETF can be most influenced.  In the case of HACK, the team behind the product made it clear to our account team that they envisioned a proactive, nimble effort to use the ongoing headlines as an entry point for highlighting the relevance of the cyber security theme. Articles, TV appearances, bell ringings, webinars, web advertisements, social media, blog posts and more were put to work to elevate the presence of the product.</p><p> With  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/ARCX/HACK/quote.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more than $900 million in AUM as of this writing  </a> </u> , the success of PureFunds' HACK has no doubt left any number of current and aspiring ETF issuers wanting to come up with \"the next HACK\" for their lineup.  </p><h3> My counsel as someone who has helped more than a dozen issuers launch products is to follow the example: </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1) Focus on a product that meets a specific need in the market. </strong> You better be able to explain in three sentences or less what void the product is filling or new benefit it provides.</p><p> <strong>  2) Recognize that, due to innovation and fee sensitivity, lower cost products have the best chance of gaining traction. </strong>  Both institutional and retail investors are savvy to the idea that investment expenses can have a significant impact on returns.</p><p> <strong>  3) Be aggressive and creative in promoting the product. </strong> Don't blow a billion dollar idea by failing to invest in the marketing of the concept.</p><p> Read more about our thoughts on marketing and PR ideas for investment and financial services industry firms <a href=\"http://www.FinancialServicesMarketing.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Jason Lawit | <a href=\"https://www.northerntrust.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Northern Trust  </u> </a>  </p><p> Economics is the study of wealth and resources and, perhaps - depending upon your politics - scarcity.  Economics provides us with rules and theories to better understand individuals and households (microeconomics) and nations and regions (macroeconomics).  Ideally, these rules help us make better and more informed decisions through time and add a dimension to our understanding of the world.</p><p> An economic concept I sometimes consider in an attempt to get a better understanding of an issue is Agency Cost.  Agency Cost is the cost associated with non perfect alignment of goals between an agent and principal.    </p><p> The idea of principal and agent and associated costs can be orthodox.  The most traditional example is the cost associated with conflicting incentives between a company's shareholders and its management.  Agency costs can also be direct or indirect.  For executive management (an agent), a direct Agency Cost would be the cost of creating and monitoring a performance structure which aligns company executives to manage the company for maximized long term growth.  An indirect cost might be the cost to shareholders where an executive was more concerned with his legacy (backward looking), as a steward of a company, than - forward looking - maximizing shareholder value.</p><h3> Agency Costs can also be thought of more broadly.  </h3><p> <br/> Consider a municipal police agency whose aim is to protect and serve the people.  The broad population can be considered the principals and police officers agents.  Additional rules, procedures and oversight necessary to provide confidence that police officers represent the people consistently and fairly could be considered Agency Costs.</p><p> A very learned friend of mine once suggested the history of the world could be understood through agency costs.  While I don't know if I would go that far, Game of Thrones (the TV series) provides a contained world which can benefit from an Agency Cost perspective.  Think of the following relationships (to name a few) in Game of Thrones and how they might be understood from an Agency Cost perspective:</p><li> Daenerys - Tyrion</li><li> The Iron Throne King - Small Council</li><li> Night's Watch - John Snow</li><li> Catelyn Stark - Brienne  <br/>  </li><h3> Think of Daenerys recently engaging Tyrion as an advisor.</h3><p> <br/> Daenerys seems to have a clear set of objectives - take the Iron Throne and rule the Seven Kingdoms (and be a good mother to her dragons).  Tyrion seems to have a less straightforward series of goals: revenge, prove his Father wrong and, perhaps - just rule for the people.  The goals have some overlap, but Tyrion's goals are not perfectly aligned with Daenerys.  What is the cost of such agency?  Does the value of the advice of Tyrion outweigh such cost?  How might Daenerys better provide incentive to Tyrion to give advice best aligned with her goals?</p><p> Perhaps Danerys' exercise of capital punishment (by dragon) several episodes ago can be viewed as a means to manage such Agency Costs.</p>",

    "content": "<p> We all get lost in the daily shuffle and grind. Life moves at a speed that can run down the most happy and organized people. Whenever I feel as though I&rsquo;m moving a little too quickly and missing the joy in any moment, I consider these thoughts, 12 great reminders to get me back on track&hellip; </p><p> <strong>  I can&mdash;and there are no limits. </strong>  You know the expression, whether you think you can or can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re right? That&rsquo;s true. I think to have any doubts about yourself is the equivalent of letting a traitor guide your life. More so, what you consider possible will never be a function of your ability as much as it will be a function of your beliefs.</p><p> <strong>  My frustration comes from my beliefs not my circumstances. </strong> Life happens and things go wrong&mdash;every single day. People drop balls, there&rsquo;s traffic, flight delays, events schedules during the football games (oh dear). The reason this frustrates you is because you believe it should never happen to you. Get over it.</p><p> <strong>  My life is my responsibility. </strong> Statistically, 75% of people are externally focused versus internally focused. This means more people say or think things such as my wife is driving me crazy, my boss is being unreasonable, or my children aren&rsquo;t treating me well as opposed to I&rsquo;m not reacting well to the way my wife is behaving and so forth. You control your thoughts, which feed your actions or reactions. Own them. Don&rsquo;t turn over control of your emotions to someone else.</p><p> <strong>  I have this moment. </strong> Regret changes the past as much as anxiety changes the future. Only gratitude for your present can change this moment. To be fully present goes hand and hand with&hellip; </p><p> <strong>  Remain open. </strong> An open mind is the most peaceful place you&rsquo;ll ever encounter. There is no wind, rain, or snow disturbing the sunshine. It provides an uninhibited ability to think or learn or positively exchange with yourself or someone else.</p><p> <strong>  My brain is wonderful, but it&rsquo;s a slower learner than my heart. </strong> Your heart will always know the truth well before your mind ever figures it out. Just think about the last time (or any time for that matter) you threw in the towel. How overdue was that toss?</p><p> <strong>  There is no such thing as &ldquo;experience.&rdquo; There is only perception. </strong>  Do you realize that there is no experience without observation? You observe based on what you perceive. Your perceptions create your beliefs. Your beliefs create your behaviors. Your behaviors produce or reproduce your experience. It&rsquo;s that, uh, simple.</p><p> <strong>  Major setbacks are necessary. </strong> You will never enjoy your life until you learn how to embrace your challenges. The major setbacks you face as you pursue your life&rsquo;s purpose will never hurt as much as the accumulation of half-hearted stumbles you continually encounter performing acts you don&rsquo;t love for people you don&rsquo;t care about.</p><p> <strong>  Comparison kills. </strong> The happier you can be for some else the less likely you&rsquo;ll be to compare him or her to yourself. Comparison is also a recipe for mediocrity. If your goal is to be &ldquo;better than&rdquo; someone else or you grade life on a curve, you&rsquo;ll never reach your true potential because you&rsquo;ll feel you&rsquo;ve reached it when you&rsquo;ve surpassed someone. Usually that means you&rsquo;re leaving something on the table. The only person you need to be better than is your yesterday&rsquo;s self.</p><p> <strong>  I will have no regrets. </strong> I&rsquo;ve met many people in my life. The older ones that have regret usually do so not because of what they did or didn&rsquo;t try or accomplish, but how they treated people over the course of their lives.</p><p> <strong>  Everything I want is on the other side of fear. </strong> Fear is nothing more that an emotion you feel right before a great growing opportunity. Dive in. The fastest way to become fabulous is to start embracing the mistakes you haven&rsquo;t made yet. I think when I&rsquo;m done writing this post; I&rsquo;ll go make a few right away just so I can get them out of the way.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s okay to be different. </strong> To attempt to be someone else is a great waste of you. The greatest day of my life was the day I discovered it was okay to do things differently than others. The second greatest day was the day I realized I didn&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s permission regarding this. You&rsquo;ll be better off if you not only embrace your uniqueness, but also flaunt it!</p>",

    "link": "second-hand-stress",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The brain is very sensitive to anything that may be perceived as a threat in our environment. When we become aware of stress that others carry around us, it sends a very clear signal that we too should be worried. This triggers what&rsquo;s called an &ldquo;amygdala hijack&rdquo; where the more primitive part of our brain responds in a more knee-jerk reactive way (based on the limbic system, fight or flight mechanisms) rather than a mindful, responsive, reflective way.</p><p> When we experience stress, whether real or imagined, it requires a greater amount of energy to be used in order to fuel potential fight or flight situations. This means we can become more fatigued as the day goes on, easily carrying our irritability or distracted thinking into the home where it can negatively impact our interpersonal relationships with those we care about.</p><p> People who cause second-hand stress are usually unaware of the impact they&rsquo;re having on others. Most people don&rsquo;t realize how sensitive the brain is at picking up things like non-verbal cues, changes in voice tone or inflection, noise, physical tension, or choice of language. <strong>   If someone is aware that they might be causing second-hand stress, </strong> the best thing they could do is take a few deep breaths before communicating or interacting with others. Second-hand stress can also be caused via email, so saving messages as drafts first and spending a few extra moments re-reading for not just type but also tone can be helpful, saving precious time and energy in the long run.</p><p> <strong>  The best way to limit the effects of second-hand stress </strong>  is to become self protective of your energy, building appropriate boundaries and establishing healthy habits that allow for personal recovery such as 5-minute breaks every hour, getting up to stretch or walk around for a few minutes, deep breathing exercises, mini-meditations, and adding more humor into your day. Being able to see minor annoyances in the scope of the bigger picture can help mediate the intensity of the stress, decreasing its effects. Practice seeing what&rsquo;s positive around you by writing down a few things your grateful for each morning so that the negatives don&rsquo;t have as much power to stress you out.</p><p> A few other quick tips for decreasing second-hand stress:</p><li> Schedule consistent 50-minute work hours and make sure to force yourself to take a break for 5-10 minutes away from it all.</li><li> When a colleague asks to talk for a minute (and you know it&rsquo;s going to take longer) set expectations from the beginning by letting them know how much time you have. By communicating with the right attitude (&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to chat but I only have 2 minutes right now&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to discuss this but it&rsquo;s a bad time, let&rsquo;s pick a time where I can give you my full attention&rdquo;) people won&rsquo;t feel shunned and you can still keep your focus where you need it in the moment. If you do decide to chat, set a timer to go off in the allotted time frame so you aren&rsquo;t constantly worried about the clock. This helps you to be more fully engaged in the moment, and will keep the conversation more on point.</li><li> Schedule &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; in your calendar away from the office to recharge your energy (go to a coffee shop, walk in the park, go to a bookstore and browse, get a massage). These recharge appointments should be just as important as any other client or team meetings you have during the day.</li><li> Turn off distractions as much as possible. Limit email time to certain blocks during the day and take mailbox offline when returning emails so you&rsquo;re not fighting a losing battle (respond to 1 message, receive 5 more). Face away from your computer screen whenever possible. Close your door. Wear silencing headphones to block out background noise. Have a sign you put on your door or cubicle wall when you&rsquo;re in &ldquo;focus mode&rdquo; asking people to come back in 30 minutes. <br/>  </li><p> Final thoughts: Stress can be a positive source of motivation if we have the resilience to manage it effectively. When stress becomes hazardous is when we&rsquo;re running low on resources such as time and energy, and our brain becomes overly sensitive to the negatives around us. By far, the best way to fight off second-hand stress is to build in consistent self-care practices that allow time for recovery and relaxation. Simple things like moving more often, eating regularly, and taking consistent breaks can recharge our system so we&rsquo;re better able to handle the stress that is a naturally occurring element in a healthy life.</p>",

    "title": "Millennials and Impact Investing Go Hand in Hand",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trilinc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   TriLinc Global  </u> </a>  </p><p> The Millennial generation is set to receive the reins as the US undertakes the greatest generation-to-generation wealth transfer to date. The Millennial generation─ those born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s─ has a different take on the primary role of business compared to previous generations. As presented in the WEF report  <u>  <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_II_FromMarginsMainstream_Report_2013.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   From the Margins to the Mainstream  </a> </u> , &ldquo;in a recent study of 5,000 Millennials across 18 countries, respondents ranked &lsquo;to improve society&rsquo; as the number one priority of business [36% of survey respondents]. This does not imply that the next generation of investors will not seek market returns [35% of survey respondents]. However, the emerging generation of investors is likely to seek achievement of social objectives in addition to financial returns.&rdquo;</p><p> The Millennial generation also has a larger propensity to donate time, money and work than previous generations. Here are some figures from the  <u>  Millennial Impact Report </u>  conducted by Achieve:</p><li> 52% of Millennials would be interested in monthly giving.</li><li> 72% of Millennials are interested in participating in a nonprofit young professional group.</li><li> 83% of Millennial respondents made a financial gift to an organization in 2012. <br/>  </li><p> The research is clear: Millennials are generous but also very conscientious of whom and where their money is going. Millennials are understandably skeptical of the investments they make. In &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=9&amp;ved=0CIABEBYwCA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhandle.dtic.mil%2F100.2%2FADA479789&amp;ei=OF6BUoeNJKW9iwLrg4DYCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJ60AZtBI-MC9COviy9Ny9JWJChQ&amp;sig2=zXGoruxZBGnOVw382gtjzQ&amp;bvm=bv.56146854,d.cGE\" target=\"_blank\">   Leading Generation Y  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; Lieutenant Colonel Jill M. Newman of the United States Army argues, &ldquo;The [Millennials] have witnessed more scamming, cheating lying and exploiting than ever before from major figures especially in finance in recent years.&rdquo; The skeptical nature of this generation requires greater transparency on the part of financial sector organizations to attract this demographic.</p><p> The Deloitte report  <u>  Catalysts for Change </u>  states that the 75 million Millennials are positioned to become the wealthiest generation ever, surpassing the 80 million Baby Boomers. &ldquo;From the Margins to the Mainstreams&rdquo; projects &ldquo;over the next 40 years, an estimated US$ 41 trillion will be transferred&rdquo; from Baby Boomers to their heirs, resulting in a powerful Millennial generation. The Millennials&rsquo; beliefs and values will be the drivers behind the world&rsquo;s political, social, environmental and economic changes.</p><p> Impact Investing is turning out to be an appealing investment approach for Millennials due to its differing outcomes and operations than those of traditional investing. Impact Investing provides a new way of tackling the world&rsquo;s most pressing issues while still providing an acceptable financial return. It also enables investors to place their money according to their values without having to forgo financial opportunities. While impact investments may currently represent a small portion of many adults&rsquo; portfolios,  <u>  JP Morgan </u>  forecasts a drastic increase in these types of investments as money changes hands on a generational scale. They estimate that impact investing may expand from about $9 billion today to $1 trillion by 2020.</p><p> Many companies have sought out to democratize impact investing, in anticipation of the growing popularity. No longer are accredited investors the only investors offered a slice of the impact investing pie. With the introduction of new retail offerings, non-accredited investors, like many Millennials, have been given the opportunity to invest in corporations and businesses that share their values through impact investing.</p><p> This generous, yet monetarily wise generation will find ways to advocate for social and environmental missions, while still maintaining financial responsibility. Of course it&rsquo;s only speculation, but it would seem that impact investing is an investment approach that is in line with Millennials. Demand creates supply. With this evidence the future for impact investing looks promising. Impact investing and Millennials go hand in hand.</p>",

A little imagination goes a long way to inspire ulcers and induce migraines in every creative team you hire. </p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t bother to figure out what you want. </strong></p><p> There&rsquo;s no need to give direction or share what you like and dislike. If a vendor is good at what they do, they should be able to read your mind. Keep reminding them that you&rsquo;ll know &ldquo;it&rdquo; when you see it, and that you completely trust their ability to create something amazing. </p><p> In between those reminders, make sure they know they are dispensable and there are a dozen other starving artists out there who would love to have your business.</p><p> <strong>  Expect perfection with the first draft, and every evolution after that. </strong></p><p> The idea that top quality concepts are a work in progress is a total myth. The really good designers, strategists, and consultants don&rsquo;t have to go through multiple drafts. If they&rsquo;re worth your money, they should be able to nail it the first time. Exactly to match that vision you had in your mind, but were unable to articulate.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be shy about reminding them of your utmost confidence in their ability to get it right the first time. Of course, they should know you will also seriously question whether they are worth their rate if they fail &mdash; it&rsquo;s good to instill a little fear now and then.</p><p> <strong>  Refuse to be educated about your vendor&rsquo;s creative or technical process. </strong></p><p> Why should you bother trying to understand what you&rsquo;ve hired a vendor to do? There&rsquo;s no reason to invest time in something that isn&rsquo;t your primary responsibility. </p><p> When creatives attempt to explain workflow or technical details, just insist they get the job done, and the sooner the better. If they say ridiculous things like &ldquo;re-rendering will take two extra days&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t be afraid to call their bluff and make them aware that you totally see through their petty excuses.</p><p> <strong>  Completely change direction when the project is almost finished. </strong></p><p> A good vendor should be willing to switch creative tracks at any point in the process, even if the project has already been approved or is almost done. If the vendor tries to adjust the budget, tell them how cheated you feel. </p><p> Forceful threats to badmouth their services to all your business connections are also quite effective if a vendor tries to stand their ground.</p><p> <strong>  Ask for lots of extras, then act shocked when the bill is more than the original quote. </strong></p><p> Proposals are meant to function as general guidelines, not binding agreements. If a creative team has to pull an all-nighter because you added extra requirements and also moved up the deadline, so what ? Making customers happy is why they exist, so don&rsquo;t sweat it.</p><p> If the bill is more than you were originally quoted, pitch a fit! There&rsquo;s no reason they should charge you extra just because the job took three times longer than was estimated or because you changed your mind seventeen times.</p>",

    "title": "Top 10 SEO Tactics That Will No Longer Work For You",
    "link": "top-10-seo-tactics-that-will-no-longer-work-for-you",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": " The SEO landscape has changed. Are you implementing out-dated SEO strategies that will hurt your search engine rankings?<p> <br/> Link-building and keywords aren&rsquo;t as effective as they use to be. As marketers, we must stay updated with the most effective SEO practices so we can drive more traffic to our sites without being penalized.</p><p> With that said, here&rsquo;s my top 10 SEO tactics that will no longer work for you&hellip;</p><h3> 1. Keywords Need to Be An Exact Match.</h3><p> <br/> Your Content Marketing Goal Should Be To Inform The Reader, Not The Search Engines  </p><p> Stuffing an article with keywords is like stuffing your pants. It may increase attraction at first glance but when its time to deliver value, you may fall short.</p><p> Keywords do not need to be repeated verbatim throughout a piece of content. When developing a headline, its always best to construct it so that it makes the sense to your audience.</p><p> Recommendation: Keeping the headline somewhere between 4-10 words is best.</p><h3> 2. Meta Descriptions Impact Search Rankings</h3><br /><p> Meta descriptions concisely explain the content of webpages and show up underneath a search engine result. Naturally, you will think Google takes this into account when displaying a users search result. Unfortunately, not so much.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jK7IPbnmvVU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-11-at-7.02.46-AM.png\" width=\"851\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> Meta descriptions and meta keywords have no bearing on search rankings. However, I must note that it will certainly make a difference in your click-through rates.</p><p> Meta descriptions are similar to email subject lines. So, you should consider using a similar strategy when developing eye-catching subject lines as you create meta descriptions.</p><p> Simply put, the user&rsquo;s behavior when scrolling down their email is similar to scrolling for search results with regard to searching for the most relevant email.</p><h3> 3. Google Authorship Increase My Search Visibility</h3><p> <br/> For year search engine marketers touted the importance of getting  <u>  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6083347?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Authorship  </a> </u>  established for your blog. Unfortunately, Google removed Google Authorship photos from its search engine results. However, your name and byline do still appear.</p><h3> 4. More Links Are Better Than More Content</h3><p> <br/> Prioritizing link building over content creation is like putting the cart before the horse.</p><p> A common misconception is that link building is critical to building site authority.</p><p> When executing link building, quality is often foreshadowed by quantity of link backs to a website. To ensure you increase the quality and quantity of back links, you must create great content that other sites want link to.</p><h3> 5. Keyword Optimization Is THE Key to SEO</h3><p> <br/> The ability to link human thought with written language when searching on its site was perhaps the most difficult task Google overcame. For instance, if a user is searching for something in which they are completely unfamiliar, I&rsquo;m sure they also may be unfamiliar with the appropriate search terms needed to produce optimal results within Google.</p><p> As a result, Google no longer matches the keywords a user types in its search engine to the keywords of a web page. Instead, it considers the intent behind the keywords a user types so it can match that intent to relevant content.</p><h3> 6. The H1 Is The Most Important On-Page Element</h3><p> <br/> The H1 is part of CSS (custom style sheet) that a designer uses to reference a font style and size applied to a piece of content.</p><p> The title of this section, for example, uses the H1 tag to prominently display the text and help structure the article&rsquo;s flow.</p><p> In the past, some marketers found this tag to be important to SEO and started using it to game the system.</p><p> Google, and other search engines, caught whim and adjusted its algorithm to prevent marketers from cheating.</p><p> So, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter where you use the H1 tag as long as you present your most important concepts upfront and closer to the top of the page.</p><h3> 7. Local SEO Doesn&rsquo;t Matter Anymore</h3><p> <br/> This myth couldn&rsquo;t be more further from the truth. Local SEO matters, probably more so now than ever before.</p><p> In fact, Google conveyed its understanding of local SEO with the release of its new Pigeon algorithm.</p><p> The algorithm treats local search rankings more link traditional search rankings. So, if you&rsquo;re a local business, optimizing for local search will help you be found by consumers&rsquo; whom search for your product or service and those in your general vicinity.</p><h3> 8. SEO Is All About Ranking <br/> <a href=\"https://www.branded3.com/blog/structured-data-mark-higher-ctr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></h3><p> There is a strong correlation between search results placement and click-through rates, ranking is no longer a factor.</p><p> I attribute this to user behavior and awareness of search engine optimization tricks.</p><p> Simply put, the number one spot is equivalent to a Super Bowl commercial. The masses will be aware of the product or service but knowledge and experience will force them to continue searching for the best offer or most relevant product.</p><p> As a result, they will also click on search results of lower positioning.</p><h3> 9. Micro sites You Own That Link Back Helps Your SEO</h3><p> <br/> Another myth is believing that linking micro sites that you own back to your main site will help your SEO. Wrong! That&rsquo;s like voting for yourself in an election a hundred times &mdash; that still counts as one vote.</p><p> Ultimately, by owning and optimizing several sites simply to increase search engine ranking to your main site is counterproductive. You should put all your focus on optimizing your main site and benefit from the increased exposure that will lead to generating more link backs to your site.</p><h3> 10. SEO and Content Marketing Don&rsquo;t Mix</h3><p> <br/> Inbound marketing is critical to SEO. In essence, the more content you create with content marketing in mind, the better your SEO will be.</p><p> SEO is a specific marketing tactic that focuses on improving viability from search engine results.</p><p> Overall, its best to fuel your SEO strategy with content marketing as that&rsquo;s a surefire and long-tailed strategy to find your business in the middle of a consumer&rsquo;s purchase journey.</p><h3> Final Thoughts</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re new to SEO or a seasoned veteran, it&rsquo;s important to understand the common misconception involved with the practice.</p><p> These misconceptions will have you implementing ineffective SEO tactics or even tactics that can hurt your SEO efforts.</p><p> Understanding the latest SEO tactics will improve your online marketing strategy and increase user awareness when searching for information about your product or service.</p>",

    "title": "Are There Social Media Alternatives to Email Marketing?",
    "link": "are-there-social-media-alternatives-to-email-marketing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> Back in 2007, we wrote the blog post &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/emerging-alternatives-to-e-mail-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Emerging alternatives to e-mail marketing  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; highlighting some different techniques marketers were using to reach their audience.</p><p> The blog post covers reaching your audience through text messaging, instant messaging, and Facebook. We also covered an early mobile marketing campaign that one company created using texting and Myspace.</p><p> Obviously, 2007 is long gone and there&rsquo;s no business audience on Myspace for anyone to even try to reach. Online trends change quickly and it&rsquo;s important to stay on top of what is emerging today.</p><p> Many social media sites deal with fleeting popularity, but sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter have shown some lasting power. Here&rsquo;s a few ideas for email marketing alternatives on social media that we&rsquo;ve come up with:</p><h3> LinkedIn</h3><p> <br/> LinkedIn is a great way to share information with other industry professionals. Sharing posts or even publishing your own content on LinkedIn&rsquo;s news feed gives you visibility outside of a set group in an email list.  You can post articles from your blog with a teaser and encourage interested readers to visit your site to read the entire post. It&rsquo;s also a great place to share articles, content, and other information created by others.</p><h3> LinkedIn Pulse</h3><p> <br/> LinkedIn also has a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/open-linkedin-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   publishing platform  </a> </u>  for posting articles called LinkedIn Pulse. LinkedIn Pulse allows you to craft blog like posts and articles directly on LinkedIn. When you post a new article, it&rsquo;s available to everyone that uses LinkedIn, not just your connections.</p><p> If you&rsquo;d like to try LinkedIn Pulse to publish new updates, go to your LinkedIn profile and find the &ldquo;Publish a post&rdquo; button. See the image below for an example:</p><br /><h3> Other Social Sites</h3><p> <br/> Social sites like Facebook and Twitter have highly beneficial offerings, but nothing quite like the unique power of email. You have the ability to share blog posts and website articles with your followers and have public conversations directly on the comments of post. You also have the ability to directly message users of the site, but many users prefer not to receive promotional messages in their private message inbox.</p><p> The major perk of sharing updates on sites like Facebook and Twitter is the audience.  <u>  <a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/company\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Combined  </a> </u> , the  <u>  <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sites have  </a> </u>  1.59 billion monthly active uses &ndash; way more than your email list. The trick to social media is getting these users to follow or like your company&rsquo;s page. If you get users to follow your page, they are more likely to see your posts and potentially read your articles.</p><p> You can also &ldquo;hashtag&rdquo; your Twitter posts with popular hashtags to reach a greater audience within an industry or even at a trade show.</p><h3> Social Media Still Doesn&rsquo;t Top Email</h3><p> <br/> Social media is definitely something you should add to your marketing campaign, but should not be used as a replacement for email. Because email marketing still works and has tremendous value in your marketing arsenal, you should instead look to  expand your reach  by supplementing with social media.</p><p> Email continues to be a powerful and effective tool for reaching your qualified contacts. Just like in 2007, when we wrote that original blog post, email is still a great tool for communicating with your contacts and leads. It&rsquo;s important to stay on top of online trends like social media, but it&rsquo;s not yet time to kick email out of your marketing plan.</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>",

However, just because there&rsquo;s a hole doesn&rsquo;t mean you should go sticking your button in it.  Next time you button up your suit jacket or sport coat, follow these rules to protect yourself from any fashion faux pas.</p><h3> One Button Jacket</h3><p> <br/> With no extra buttons to worry abou t, the one button coat is the easiest to remember.  Button up while standing and unbutton when seated. </p><h3> Two Button Jacket</h3><p> <br/> Repeat after me &lsquo;Never button your bottom button.&rsquo;  The top button is all you need to fasten on a two-button coat.  If you are guilty of double-buttoning take a peak in the mirror, you&rsquo;ll notice the bottom of your jacket doesn&rsquo;t lay right.  When you release the last button and set it free, you not only allow for a proper drape but your own movements will feel less restricted.</p><h3> Three Button Jacket</h3><p> <br/> Three button coats break down to three mindful words: sometimes, always, never.  Meaning the top button is optional, sometimes you feel like it sometimes you don&rsquo;t.  Always fasten your center button and once again &lsquo;never button your bottom button.&rsquo;</p><h3> Last but Not Least</h3><p> <br/> No matter how many buttons on your jacket, don&rsquo;t forget this&hellip;If you take a seat don&rsquo;t drag your feet, unbutton your jacket, try and be discrete.  On the other hand, when you stand channel your inner gentleman, fasten up the right buttons you learned about in this lesson plan. </p>",

All you have to do is reach up and touch them,&rdquo; he said to me.</p><p> I believed him and, over my career, he continued to remind me to overcome the obstacles in my path and to focus on the possibilities in front of me.</p><p> That&rsquo;s what I want from my financial advisor. <strong>  Someone who knows me well enough to be able to help me focus on the possible outcomes I can achieve, Someone who will motivate me to take the small, doable, steps that will ensure I achieve my goals. </strong></p><p> Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not been my experience. For many advisors the ideal client seems to be the ones who hand over their financial assets, congratulate him when the portfolio goes up, is understanding when the portfolio is down and happily pays the fees that reward him for a job well done.</p><p> But there is so much more to being a good financial advisor than doling out financial advice. We tend to think about trust in a relationship as a &ldquo;given&rdquo; rather in terms of the hard work that it takes to earn people&rsquo;s trust. <br/> <br/> No doubt, the function of financial advisors is changing. Financial institutions are trying to recruit more women because they understand that <strong>  women are better at building trust and forging relationship. </strong> But this isn&rsquo;t just about whether advisors are male or female. It&rsquo;s about changing the business model, making it more about the client and less about the firm. For that to happen a lot more has to change than the gender of financial advisors. Every aspect of advice needs to evolve beyond the needs of the organization &ndash; recruiting, revenue models, compensation, culture, services, communication even products all need to be part of the transition.</p><p> Some advisors are getting it and for them a bright future exists because there is a real need for financial advice. But good advice isn&rsquo;t limited to financial advice, Its true potential lies in building the confidence of clients who need to believe in the possibilities they, not their advisor, are capable of. They need to believe that every small step they take will get them closer to their goal -- and this is never more true than with female clients. </p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you subscribe to consultative selling you already know that asking good questions is key to understanding customer needs, but are you asking questions too quickly?</p><p> Much like the days of starting with the &ldquo;product pitch&rdquo; are long gone, so are the days of starting client conversations with a firing line of questions. Yet, it happens every day. Well-intentioned salespeople use a myriad of questions to uncover needs designed so they can position value. On the other side of the table &ndash; frustration, impatience and perceived irrelevance to the client&rsquo;s business situation.</p><p> While it is true that questions are at the heart of in-depth and mutually beneficial conversations, you have to ask yourself, &ldquo;Have I earned the right?&rdquo;</p><p> Sixty seconds. That&rsquo;s about the time that you have to position a relevant point of view, one that translates that you have something valuable to offer that is specific to each customer&rsquo;s business and personal wins and outcomes. If you start asking questions too soon, or even worse, inappropriately, you have given the customer absolutely no reason to want to engage with you. You don&rsquo;t have to be right, you just have to provide some value upfront that instigates interest. For instance you may say, &ldquo;I see that you are expanding business growth in India. I looked at your trade lanes and think we might be able to increase your efficiencies. We have tremendous experience in this market and would like to explore how this could positively impact your business outcomes.&rdquo;</p><p> Stating a relevant and insightful point of view allows you to level-set expectations, gain commitment upfront and set the path for meaningful exploration. You have mutual agreement upfront &ndash; now your questions matter.</p><h3> So How Do You Start With A Relevant Point of View?</h3><p> <br/> I am not suggesting that you guess. To make a statement without intelligence is worthless. You undoubtedly know the value that your potential solutions bring to your clients. That&rsquo;s good. To state these without knowing about the customer&rsquo;s business issues &ndash; that&rsquo;s not so good. So how do you find out what the issues are if you haven&rsquo;t met with the customer?</p><h3> Pre-Call Intelligence is Key</h3><p> <br/> It is not your customer&rsquo;s job to educate you. There is absolutely no excuse to go in cold. I feel like I am stating the obvious when I suggest basic pre-call activities like looking at the customer&rsquo;s website, signing up for Google alerts, reading company press releases, looking at LinkedIn profiles and company pages. Yet, I talk to salespeople frequently who say that they know they should do these things, but don&rsquo;t take the time. You have to ask if the time spent up front outweighs the quality conversation it produces.</p><h3> Opening the Call</h3><p> <br/> This is where you build rapport with the customer based on behavioral style and specific to what you learned in your pre-call intelligence. You are not making a product recommendation or even presenting a specific solution at this time. You are simply establishing relevancy based on what you anticipate to be the needs of the customer. You are answering the question, &ldquo;Why are you here and why should I listen to you?&rdquo; You are showing the customer that you care enough to know more than just the basics of who they are, but that you have some idea of their situation and how you might help. This lays the foundation for fruitful discovery that is mutually productive.</p><h3> Asking Questions</h3><p> <br/> Now that you and the customer have agreed on the topic and framework for your discussion, this is the time to incorporate the questions that you need to explore the situation and position solutions. How you ask questions is critical. Improper use of questions will make you seem transactional, which is counter-intuitive to consultative selling. In consultative selling, you want the customer to see their &ldquo;burning issues&rdquo; and how you can solve those issues. If they are perceived as a &ldquo;firing line&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t expect much support from your client.</p><h3> Downloadable Job Aid</h3><p> <br/> Download the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/blog/relevant-point-of-view\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   corresponding Job Aid  </a> </u>  for this article from the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/blog/relevant-point-of-view\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Consultative Sales Certification  </a> </u>  site.</p>",

What you have available to spend will be far less than what you planned.</p><p> Retirees I know have varying degrees of risk tolerance. A plan only works if you can stick with it. If you abandon a portfolio that has more volatility than you expected, your plan is in jeopardy.</p><p> The Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index represent only 500 of the nearly 15,000 publicly traded stocks available world-wide. By using index funds your equity allocation can be diversified across thousands of stocks in a cost-efficient manner. In addition, there are many fixed income choices besides intermediate-term U.S. government bonds.</p><p> Academic models and retirement rules of thumb blindly apply a rule on how to withdraw agnostic of other cash flow and balance sheet items that may affect your household and your need for income.</p><p> During a transition into retirement all the households I know have varying sources of cash flows, age differentials, lumpy expense items and other considerations that must be accounted for in developing their personal plan.</p><p> Don't get me wrong. I am not criticizing the academic research. I think research provides a great starting place on how to view spending in retirement &mdash; but it is no substitution for a personal plan.</p><p> And once you have a plan, it is  <u>  <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/od/budgetingsaving/tp/Beware-of-the-Retirement-Rules-of-Thumb.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   not wise to simply apply a rule of thumb  </a> </u>  for the next 30 years. That is like doing a physical exam when you're 40, and then assuming if you eat healthy and exercise regularly you won't need to go back to the doctor until you're 70.</p><p> What is important to your retirement success is personalized ongoing planning; a process whereby each year you check your vital signs and run a new projection on the sustainability of your income. This allows you to spot signs of trouble 20 years out and make small adjustments today that will keep your plan working all the way into your later years.</p><p> Just as you wouldn't assess your health based solely on a research report, don't base your retirement income solely on an academic model or rule of thumb.</p>",

More specifically, being found in a fraction of the 3.5 billion Google searches completed each day.</p><p> Think about this: on average Google processes over 40,000 search queries every second.</p><p> Recent data from Similar Web shows that the third most important channel for finance marketing is organic search (24.77%).</p><p> Where once customer relationships were formed through personal contact, today they are often forged largely through the content people access online.</p><p> As a result, your content must be easy to find, engaging, and of real value to your clients.</p><p> Now if you are looking at this thinking, &ldquo;Fantastic all I have to do is pop my website on Google. The 24.77% of people looking for a finance related product will find me&rdquo;&hellip; you&rsquo;re going to get left in the dust.</p><p> If 40,000 people are looking for something every second then you can bet you&rsquo;re not going to be the first brand they find.</p><h3> So How Do I Get Real PR Influence Now?</h3><li> Search engine optimisation</li><p> All digital content can be optimised for search, so do your keyword research and apply SEO principles to everything! This means media releases, white papers, videos&hellip; you name it. Creating a useful online tool is a great way to add value for your audience. More importantly it helps your brand come up in times of need, delivers instant value and positions you as the expert in your field.</p><li> Online media/blogger relations</li><p> By getting mentions in digital media and blogs online visibility of your brand increases. Articles in major publications often have high search rankings, which makes news about your brand and offerings easy to find.</p><h3> Is That It?</h3><p> <br/> Nope. Trust is also key, so don&rsquo;t forget about your brand&rsquo;s reputation. 96% of financial service leads come from organic marketing, so you can&rsquo;t rely on people clicking ads only.</p><p> Reputation is harder to scrub from the front-page of google. Buyer behaviour has changed.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Cold calling is usually viewed as a frustrating and time consuming activity that leads to rejection and misery. If that&rsquo;s the case, why do we continue to leverage this strategy? Many advisors still find it is a cost effective way to shake up the prospecting tree and increase pipeline activity.</p><p> Cold calling is a learned skill; mastering it requires practice and a written process. Advisors and sales associates often expect immediate results. When positive results are meager, many give up because they are convinced cold calling doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p> Whether you rely on referrals, social media, or events as primary prospecting methods, at some point the conversation needs to advance. Cold calling drives you to take the next step and move potential clients further into your sales funnel. To gain progress and an impact to your prospecting pipeline, you need to look at the strategy as a process that must be studied, modified, and tested.</p><p> Use the following tips to make cold calling more effective and profitable for your firm.</p><h3> Research Your Prospects</h3><li> Know who you are calling. The best sales teams build prospect personas to determine who aligns with your ideal client profile definitions and are most suitable for your products and services. A good persona should identify what motivates a prospect. Outline specific demographics such as industry, profession, and life style, and most importantly, what their biggest challenges are. Honing in on this information helps you develop a relationship and position your offering.</li><h3> Write Your Script</h3><li> Once you have determined who you&rsquo;re calling, think about what you want to say. Write a brief script (no more than three or four sentences) that introduces yourself, explains what you do, and what services you provide. Keep in mind, an effective script asks for an appointment early in the conversation. The purpose of your script is not to communicate massive amounts of information, but to earn the opportunity to talk further in detail about how you can provide a valuable service during a scheduled appointment.</li><h3> Rehearse Your Script</h3><li> Practice your script over and over until you can recite it in your own words. It&rsquo;s critical to have a conversation with your prospect and to not read your message. Don&rsquo;t fly through your script like a pushy salesperson; pause and encourage your prospect to engage in a conversation with you.</li><h3> Prepare For Objections</h3><li> One of the hardest parts of a sales position is learning how to overcome objections. Keep in mind, objections are common and most of your calls will be met with at least one. Your goal is to be prepared with a convincing response that opens the door to continue making the sale. Some of the most common objections include timeliness, authority, need, and value. Create and practice a response to each potential objection until you can communicate it naturally. Build credibility and trust by asking open-ended questions that delve further into the core of their objection and continue to ask for an appointment.</li><h3> Stay Confident &amp; Positive</h3><li> Attitude is everything. Foster a positive self-image by seeing yourself as an expert in the industry. Believe that you are competent, have valuable information to offer, and that you can help your prospects overcome their challenges and reach their personal goals. Confidence will help you convey your message more effectively, provide motivation to make calls, and reach your sales goals.</li><h3>  Leave a Message Only if Necessary</h3><li> Most voicemails don&rsquo;t receive a call back. The reason: most sales people say something like,  &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m just checking in&hellip;&rdquo;  which offers no compelling reason for a prospect to call back. Instead, your voicemail needs to be targeted and include relevant information and value. Keep your message under 30 seconds and start with the reason for your call rather than your name,  &ldquo;Hi Tom, I&rsquo;m calling today to&hellip;&hellip;.&rdquo;  Finish the call with your call back number, name, and the name of your firm. When you reframe your message with this format, the attention is moved from yourself to the solutions and value you provide.</li><h3>  Always Track &amp; Measure</h3><li> The key of tracking and measuring isn&rsquo;t the number itself. Pinpoint how you can make the numbers better. Ask yourself these questions:  <li>  How many calls were made during a specified time frame? </li> <li>  What time of day produced the best results? </li> <li>  How many quality discussions took place? </li> <li>  How many appointments were set? </li></li><p> Tracking cold calls should serve as a benefit not a burden.</p><p> Be determined to excel at cold calling by setting realistic goals, repeating your process on a daily basis, and making adjustments whenever necessary.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> I wish I had been born with a higher EQ.</h3><p> <br/> Thanks to Daniel Goleman&rsquo;s release of Emotional Intelligence in 1995 (when I was 25 and not particularly emotionally intelligent) our culture&rsquo;s EQ, along with my own EQ, continue to evolve.  Perhaps mine has just been a tad slower, with more peaks and valleys.</p><p> In my role working with companies on strategy and research, I have seen how behaviors in meetings have changed from somewhat cold and stodgy interactions in the 1990s, to today&rsquo;s more fluid conversations that are filled with humor and compassion.  In my opinion, today&rsquo;s more humanized interactions lead to much more effective strategy development, planning, and basic decision making.</p><h3> Emotional IQ and its evolution impact our purchase decisions, too. </h3><p> <br/> While the importance of emotion in purchase decision-making has been well understood since the dawn of advertising and the first Sears Roebuck catalog, the <strong>  role </strong> of emotion in brand and product choice is more sophisticated today. </p><p> Pulling on emotional heart strings of consumers requires greater depth of understanding of the customer experience and decision process. Our customers expect us to understand them more completely and have more emotional range. Emotions are not only part of the brand, they are part of the product design itself.</p><h3> I&rsquo;ll give you three examples.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Yellow Cab vs. Uber in San Francisco </strong></p><li> The emotional need of not having the stress of waiting for a cab is taken one step further with Uber.  Uber makes users feel like they are in <strong>  control </strong> of how quickly they will get to their destination. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Google Maps vs. Waze </strong></p><li> Avoiding the fear of getting lost is addressed by Google maps, but this isn&rsquo;t quite enough.  Waze has a loyal following and is more popular with many because it is user created, making it feel like you are getting personal directions and creates <strong>  fun or joy </strong> rather than simply avoiding fear.  Google found this compelling enough to buy Waze. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Hilton vs. Airbnb </strong></p><li> While Hilton has loyal customers, large reach and has successfully addressed the emotional need for comfort while traveling, Airbnb takes this one step further by giving you the comforts of home and <strong>  personal connection.  </strong> And, with the reviews process, we also feel we are in control of the experience. <br/>  </li><p> So, stretch your emotional muscles and understand the nuance in how your customers are using their emotions to make  <strong>  purchase decisions. </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-10-at-9.59.53-AM.png\" width=\"502\"/></p><p> And, consider how you can give them control over the experience.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The old sign sits at the edge of the grass airfield in Katama on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard &ndash; a simple weather-divining device involving only a stone and some pithy instructions.  It is a little worn but the message has endured.  Not just because it&rsquo;s funny, but because it serves as a commonsense reminder to pilots: before executing a flight plan, take a step back and don&rsquo;t rely solely on complex models and fancy planning tools.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"FullSizeRender\" src=\"http://www.fwp.partners/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender-e1433516999600.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> If the stone is wet, it&rsquo;s raining, if the stone is white on top, it&rsquo;s snowing, if the stone is gone&hellip;  hurricane.</p><p> Some years ago, I was spending an evening at our summer home, which is across the street from the airfield. As can happen over Cape Cod and the Massachusetts islands, a thick fog had crept in from the Atlantic. Just as the sun was going down, we heard an aircraft flying in circles over our house, lower and lower, and finally disturbingly close to the roof, as it attempted to find the Katama airfield in the fog. Our uneasy anticipation of a plane crash went on for what seemed like an hour. We eventually stopped hearing the noise and prayed that the pilot had veered off for the lighted runways of the main Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard airport or across Vineyard Sound to Hyannis. In the morning, we checked in with the airfield. Thankfully, no accident had been reported, but everyone had heard the same disturbing sounds. We all agreed that bold pilots can get themselves in trouble by relying too much on belief in their skill or fancy equipment. The saying goes, &ldquo;There are many old pilots and many bold pilots, but very few old, bold pilots.&rdquo;</p><p> What does any of this have to do with investing?</p><p> Plenty.</p><p> The investment world produces many forecasts and strategies designed on complex models and calculations. Product offices are staffed by PhD&rsquo;s in math, statistics and physics.  Actual rocket scientists are developing solutions that promise to add alpha and provide protection to help investors weather market conditions.</p><p> At Fiduciary Wealth Partners, we keep abreast of the latest ideas and explore new solutions that might help our clients.  As we wrote in our  <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/ideas/dont-be-a-sheep/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Don&rsquo;t Be A Sheep  </u>    </a> blog, however, we try hard to resist the pull of fancy new approaches and try not to run with the herd.</p><p> Why?</p><p> Because, consistently, the evidence shows that well-worn, simple approaches not only keep up but often outperform.  Many behavioral finance studies also show that investors are more likely to stick to solutions that are easily understood and that, by sticking to plans, they are more likely to reach their investment goals.</p><p> A well done piece comparing the simple to the complex was published by Vanguard in 2014.  The paper is based on independent academic research and compares data from Morningstar on all balanced funds (the good, the bad, the expensive and the low cost) to U.S. endowment portfolios, which frequently hold a complex array of traditional and alternative investments.</p><p> At the end, the researchers came to the following conclusion:</p><p> &ldquo;The majority of endowments would have been better off had they simply invested in low-cost, diversified, transparent public mutual funds.&rdquo;</p><p> By posting this, we are not suggesting that endowments are investing inappropriately based upon their goals (like individuals, every one is unique).  All we are pointing out is that keep-it-simple portfolios can keep up, and in many cases, outperform complex strategies.</p><p> The full report can be found at the following link:</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Assessing-Endowment-Performance-The-Enduring-Role-of-Low-Cost-Investing.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Assessing Endowment Performance &ndash; The Enduring Role of Low Cost Investing  </a> </u></p><p> At the end of the day, there will always be fancy new products and strategies in the investment marketplace. There are a lot of cool new gauges and instruments, too &ndash; analyses by really smart economists and market historians.</p><p> Take them all in, to whatever the limit of your tolerance for studying the markets. But don&rsquo;t forget the following:</p><li> If a strategy is so complicated that it can&rsquo;t be explained in simple terms that you understand, consider passing on it in favor of something you can understand thoroughly enough to sleep at night.</li><li> Fancy and complex can sound great, but increased complexity can also mean increased opportunity for mistakes or course corrections at the wrong time.</li><p> Even though a forecast looks promising, remember that models based on complex theories sometimes break down, especially when fog or unpredicted market storms develop.</p><p> Before starting a journey or making a major change in your financial flight plan, take a good look around at what the evidence in front of you is saying. Take a step back and consider that the best ideas, those that keep us out of trouble and on plan, may come from keep-it-simple &ldquo;rock science&rdquo;, not rocket science.</p> ",

    "content": "<p> For those of you who subscribe to the Blog, you may have received an email asking you about the fear that keeps you stuck. The fear that holds you back from living the life of your dreams. I&rsquo;ve received thousands of responses from people of all ages from around the world (Thank you!) While the specific stories may differ, the same 3 fears pop up time each time:</p><li> <strong>  The fear of being alone. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The fear of failure. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The fear of success. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Today, I&rsquo;d like to explore the fear of success. As the flip-side of the fear of failure, it often leads to self-sabotage, self-depreciation, and ironically, failure. Let me explain:</p><p> When I first started my business, I was afraid of failure. The Forbes statistic that <strong>  80% of small businesses fail in the first 18 months </strong> was ingrained in my mind. Couple that with a NYC rent and the fear of failure became a constant companion, traveling with me everywhere I went. Any decision or action was clouded by this fear. While this alone was a problem, the bigger issue was my inability to accept success. Any time something good would happen: a new article, a new client, or a new media opportunity, I&rsquo;d get stuck. Having set myself up for the worst case scenario at all times, I couldn&rsquo;t accept that good things were happening. Success made me anxious and uncomfortable because it challenged every belief I had about my situation, my life, and myself.</p><p> Initially, in an unconscious attempt to return to my more comfortable (yet uncomfortable) reality, I&rsquo;d self-sabotage. Then, when reality was more aligned with my limiting belief system, I&rsquo;d feel safe and unhappy again. WTF?! <br/>  </p><h3> Here&rsquo;s Why That Happened: <br/>  </h3><li> As humans, we&rsquo;d rather be right than be happy. We tend to prefer the safety and certainty of a world we know rather than change our beliefs, even when it&rsquo;s a positive change.</li><li> We feel undeserving. When our reality shifts quicker than our limiting beliefs, we may feel that we can&rsquo;t accept abundance. As a result, we shun it.</li><li> We&rsquo;re afraid it won&rsquo;t last so we find evidence and take actions that will confirm and recreate our fears on our timeline telling ourselves, &ldquo;see, I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t last. I was right all along.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> So What Do You Do About This? <br/>  </h3><li> Stop judging it. Labeling things as good or bad often gets in the way of our ability to experience it. </li><li> Write it down as evidence. We have antenna that selectively pick up information that confirms our worst fears. Begin amassing evidence to the contrary.</li><li> Savor it. Notice the feelings, the sights, and the sounds you associate with your success. </li><li> Create a new reality. How does this success challenge your belief about yourself? For example, when I get an especially thoughtful email from a reader, I soak it in and save it. I reread it often to reprogram my belief system from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a failure&rdquo; to &ldquo;I&rsquo;m helping others live their best lives.&rdquo;</li><li> Prioritize self-care. Even good transitions are stressful.  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/self-care-worksheets\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Be sure to maintain the self-care practices that make you feel your best  </u>  . </a></li><p> You deserve to be successful and happy.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Your client&rsquo;s long-term financial goals may be out of sync with the risks they&rsquo;re willing to take to reach them. </strong></p><p> According to a recent survey by asset manager Natixis, while <strong>  about 70% of investors they polled said that growing their assets is increasingly more important than protecting their principal investment, nearly 60% also said they were unwilling to take on more than minimal risk. </strong></p><p> For financial advisors, this is both a challenge and an opportunity.  <strong>  The challenge is being able to accurately assess a client&rsquo;s core natural risk propensity and tolerance and the opportunity is to educate the client on realistic expectations and strategies to reach their goals. </strong></p><p> Where advisors often fall short is not identifying all of the risks associated with each client: investment, financial, and personality risks.  This is an important factor because <strong>  clients under stress will operate based on their core natural behavior. </strong></p><p> As clients get closer to retirement, they are under a lot of stress. Their worries regarding accumulation of enough money for retirement may push them into new, riskier investment decisions. Escalating long-term health care costs, market uncertainties, and the emotions associated with being in the &ldquo;withdrawal stage&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;accumulation phase&rdquo; will push a client to act according to their core natural behavior.  In many cases, this mix of stress and decisions based on clients&rsquo; reaction to that stress is not beneficial for the long-term success of the portfolio.</p><p> As a financial advisor, you need to manage your client&rsquo;s behavior and protect them from themselves.  This is an important step in client engagement and your successful practice because under stress, client risk behavior is less predictable without an objective tool. Some clients will want to jump at every opportunity, others will over-spend, and still others will want to take no action.</p><p> In many cases, couples&rsquo; behavior will be directly opposite one another. So, there is an added challenge for advisors to know each of the behavior of each individual in the pair to be able to address them in different ways.</p><p> How do you uncover these behavioral risks in your clients?  You need an objective, third party system so that your clients&rsquo; behavior under stress becomes predictable and is less of a guessing game. In combination with your experience and wisdom, discovering clients&rsquo; financial natural behavior will allow you to become a behaviorally smart advisor and enhance client satisfaction and financial profile.  &ldquo;Better to be a witness, than a judge&rdquo;, commented one financial advisor who uses  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialdna.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Financial DNA  </a> </u>  as his primary tool in the client discovery.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The general public is very cool on annuities. But many economists like the idea of retirees using some portion of their savings to buy them.</p><p> Annuities, with their fixed monthly payments, may be the best way to ensure retirees&rsquo; savings last just as long as they do. <strong>  Otherwise, they may either spend it too fast and deplete their savings prematurely or spend too conservatively, depriving themselves of necessities in their old age. </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/briefs/are-cognitive-constraints-a-barrier-to-annuitization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   New research  </a> </u>  suggests that one reason retirees don&rsquo;t buy annuities is because <strong>  they have great difficulty figuring out what they&rsquo;re worth </strong> . When they try to figure this out, they bump up against their own cognitive limitations &ndash; limitations that only worsen with age.</p><p> In the study, 2,210 adults over age 18 were asked to estimate the value of a monthly annuity familiar to most workers: Social Security benefits. First, the research subjects were asked if they would pay $20,000 to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; a $100 increase in their monthly Social Security benefits. If the person said no, the survey repeated the question with a lower amount, eventually zeroing in on what this additional $100 benefit was worth to them. Next, the research subjects were asked to reduce &ndash; or &ldquo;sell&rdquo; &ndash; their monthly benefits by $100 in return for a specific dollar amount paid to them upfront.</p><p> In theory, the buy and sell prices they finally arrived at should be equal. But there was an enormous gap between the two. The median price research subjects were willing to pay was $3,000, and the median price at which they would sell was $13,750. There was also a wide range of sales prices among the individual participants: some would accept $1,500 or less, while others wanted $200,000 or more.</p><p> The researchers then showed that the gaps between buy and sell prices &ndash; a measure of one&rsquo;s ability to assess the value of an annuity &ndash; were much larger for people with limited cognitive skills and less education. The gaps for people over age 65 were also much larger than the gaps for younger people, reflecting the cognitive decline that occurs with age.</p><p> <strong>  The study confirms that annuities are difficult to value. </strong> Most people will buy them only if they&rsquo;re &ldquo;an exceptionally good deal,&rdquo; the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w19168\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u>  finds, and this impediment to annuitization &ldquo;is strongest among the least cognitively able.&rdquo;</p>",

Oh sure they&rsquo;re effective, but given your druthers, you druther not have them on your project.</p><p> The truth is, it&rsquo;s often the folks whom we&rsquo;d like to choke who are best positioned to challenge our perspective and help us grow.</p><h3> 5 Benefits to Working With People Who Drive You Crazy</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Humility</h3><p> <br/> Working with people who make your hair curl provides a perfect opportunity to practice humble patience. Focus on your shared mission, and in really listening to the bozo (oh&hellip; I mean that other human being who has a different style).</p><h3> 2. Complementary Skill Sets</h3><p> <br/> If someone is really making you crazy, it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;re focusing on areas you&rsquo;d rather not think about. Instead of being annoyed, be grateful. They can sweat that stuff so you can do you what you do best.</p><h3> 3. Their Network</h3><p> <br/> As they say, birds of a feather. Remember the &ldquo;strength of weak ties&rdquo; theory  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/weak-ties/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (  <u>   if you missed that post, click here  </u>  ). </a>  Chances are they&rsquo;re hanging out with a different crowd. If you lean in, you could substantially expand your network.</p><h3> 4. Creative Tension</h3><p> <br/> Being challenged is the best way to grow. If you can keep an open mind, their perspective may be just what you need to break through to the next level.</p><h3> 5. Improved Skills</h3><p> <br/> The best way to get better at working with people who drive you crazy is to work with people who drive you crazy. It forces you to practice all those vital teamwork skills: listening, communication, running effective meetings, working through conflict.</p><p> In fact, if you&rsquo;re not working with anyone that makes you crazy, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to seek out a  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/nemesis-mentors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   nemesis mentor  </u>  , </a>  or invite that nut job (oh, I mean really valuable human being) to join your next project.</p>",

My kid is a star soccer player and he&rsquo;s a shoe-in for a scholarship.</li><li> My kids will take care of me if I run out of money.</li><li> I&rsquo;m expecting a big bump in pay and a bonus; that will get me out of the hole.</li><li> I don&rsquo;t need to put money into the 401(k) plan&mdash;I&rsquo;ll die before I retire.</li><li> Insurance? Who needs insurance? If I die, I won&rsquo;t know.</li><li> Why save? I could be run over by a bus tomorrow.</li><li> I&rsquo;m going to win the lottery.</li><li> God will provide.</li><li> Something good will happen, I can feel it.</li><li> The more I make, the more the government takes, so why bother? <br/>  </li><p> Making excuses can be fun when it lets you beg off from some lame party that you just couldn&rsquo;t convince yourself to attend. But when it comes to money, security and financial freedom? Not so much.</p><p> Why has excuse making become so fashionable? Mostly because we live in a constant state of overwhelm. There are too many requirements and too little time; too much to know and too little understandable information. While technology makes data more accessible, it&rsquo;s also of tidal wave proportion.</p><h3> So just start here, with some basic financial management concepts:</h3><li> If you make more than you spend, you have a surplus&mdash;something to save, accumulate and spend now or later (or better yet, now AND later).</li><li> If you spend more than you make, you have a deficit&mdash;which can only happen if you dip into savings to make up the difference or you use credit as a float. Unless that float is very temporary, it&rsquo;s a very, very bad idea.</li><li> When you stop working, you need to have funds accumulated to make up for what is not coming in from pension, social security or other sources.</li><li> If you have unexpected expenses and no place to draw those funds from, you&rsquo;re in deep trouble.</li><li> Goals are important when they are tied to what you value the most. For example, a 60-inch flat screen is not a goal&mdash;it is a purchase of a thing. As opposed to &ldquo;financial independence&rdquo;&hellip;now there&rsquo;s a goal you can sink your teeth into.</li><li> Risk is real. It comes in multiple flavors and colors. If you cannot bear the risk of volatility in the stock market&mdash;and keep your money in a savings account&mdash;you WILL suffer inflation risk. If instead of keeping a certain amount of your assets in a savings account, you put them in the stock market, you will bear the risk of market volatility.</li><li> Time is either your best ally or your worst enemy. Be wary of the calendar. If you wait until you&rsquo;re 58 to begin savings and expect to retire at 66, you&rsquo;d better have a bundle to put away and hope that you don&rsquo;t live too long, especially if you have a high cost of living. But if you&rsquo;re 22 and you can start putting away for retirement, you are giving your future a huge boost.</li><li> Avoid stock tips from friends or through the media unless you don&rsquo;t care if you lose your investment.</li><li> If you don&rsquo;t know where your paycheck goes (how you spend your money), you will never have control.</li><li> Making sacrifices for the future might come with short-term pain. NOT making those sacrifices is sure to result in long-term agony. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Planning your today and your future doesn&rsquo;t have to be painful or mysterious. It&rsquo;s mostly common sense AND being willing to avoid making excuses. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> What does it mean to be a good leader? Many say that good leaders must be organized, confident, knowledgeable and great listeners. All of these qualities impact a trait we posted about recently:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inclusion-inc.com/blog/2015/05/25/256/self-awarenessthe_key_to_being_an_inclusive_leader/#.VXCBgflVhHw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   self-awareness  </a> </u> . <strong>  Another trait that&rsquo;s closely tied to self-awareness is ego management: a quality that every inclusive leader must possess. </strong></p><p> Have you ever worked with leaders whose egos were legendary: <strong>  leaders who were more focused on building their own empires than leading others effectively? </strong> Chances are the answer is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; We have a more important question for you to answer, though: <strong>  &ldquo;Have you mastered the art of ego management?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Self-awareness leads to effective ego management. Leaders need to be able to direct their egos situationally, which means recognizing when it&rsquo;s best to be center stage and when it&rsquo;s best to hang back and gather input.</p><p> The right to lead no longer resides in the person with role authority or title&mdash;it resides in the person who has the best idea at the time when the team needs it. In truth, it resides in the collective knowledge of a group of people with diverse ideas, backgrounds and perspectives: those whose collaborative insights create meaning far greater than individual inputs.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to note that great leaders need to have strong egos. Without strong egos, they might find it tough to be effective. In fact, there are many elements of strong egos that are critical for effective leadership. <strong>  The key, though, is developing the ability to balance ego and the needs of others. </strong> This balance is the key to an effective culture.</p><p> In the past, leaders felt they were required to always be the smartest person in the room or the person with all of the answers. Today&rsquo;s effective leaders&mdash; inclusive  leaders&mdash;often are those who recognize that they  don&rsquo;t  have all of the answers, and they know they don&rsquo;t need to. They value the power of their team&rsquo;s collective wisdom, insights and experiences, and they are willing to listen to others who may have more, and better, answers.</p><p> What about you? Are you adept at ego management? Be inclusive! </p>",

    "content": "<p> A couple of years ago I read a book about RAF fighter pilots in World War II. One particular passage stood out. It was this:  There are old fighter pilots and bold fighter pilots, but there are no old, bold fighter pilots.  The author was making the point that the very best dogfight pilots were young, because of superb eyesight and lightening reflexes. What do fighter pilots have to do with the world of business? Not much, although their courage could surely come in handy in several C-suites.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s my point.  Bold  should never stand on its own, nor can  bold  be singular. We don&rsquo;t want airlines, oil riggers and gas pipeline distributors acting bold. We know the downsides of this corporate behavior; we&rsquo;ve witnessed the effects of BP&rsquo;s oil spill in the Gulf, and some of us remember the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.Caution is the operative word.</p><p> But, in no way should this discount the power of  boldness. Bold  needs a qualifier, a partner. Let me give you an example of this in business leadership. Donald Trump is bold. So is Howard Schultz. These guys are as different as night and day. Trump is thought of as a bold narcissist, a bully. By contrast, Schultz, Starbucks CEO, is strategically bold, entrepreneurially bold, and imaginatively bold. He&rsquo;s been that way for 35 years. His boldness works like a charm for his customers, his employees and his shareholders.</p><p> In business,  bold  needs a partner. Here are 5 worthy qualifiers.</p><li> <strong>  Strategic Boldness. </strong>  Weak, wishy-washy strategies have no place in 21st century business. Reach for the stars and you won&rsquo;t end up with a handful of mud.</li><li> <strong>  Bold Entrepreneurship. </strong>  Sorry folks, this is a bit of a given. I&rsquo;ve never seen a successful entrepreneur known for cautiousness, have you?</li><li> <strong>  Bold Innovation. </strong>  The bolder you are in the search for innovation, the more likely you are to unearth the big idea. I&rsquo;ll compare this to the &ldquo;fire, ready, aim&rdquo; approach of innovation. Try it, adapt it, and then get it right.</li><li> <strong>  Bold Visions. </strong>  You&rsquo;ll never find a breakthrough idea for your business if your goal is to increase sales by 4 or 5%. Think 100%. Which of these targets has the best chance of finding a way to deliver a 50% increase?</li><li> <strong>  Bold and Virtuous Leadership. </strong>  Honor and honesty not only strengthens a bold leader, it impacts every follower and makes the effort worthwhile. <br/>  </li><p> Bold  is a 4-letter word that should never stand alone.</p>",

    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s been a little over a year since  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/narendra-modi-pro-business-policies-strong-sectors-growth/#.VXG7af50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Narendra Modi  </a> </u>  took office in India, and so far the results have been mostly positive for the South Asian country and the surrounding region. Among other achievements, Modi&rsquo;s government has managed to enact important policy reforms, increase public investments in infrastructure, lower food inflation and generally open India up to business on a global scale.</p><p> CLSA&rsquo;s chief equity strategist, Christopher Wood, gives the country accolades in his most recent newsletter. Wood writes that while &ldquo;the halo effect has come off the Modi phenomenon&rdquo; somewhat, India nonetheless remains &ldquo;the most promising major emerging market story on a five- to 10-year view globally.&rdquo;</p><p> Looking ahead, analysts forecast that India&rsquo;s economy will expand between 7.5 percent and 8.5 percent for the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years,  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/interactive/the-periodic-table-of-emerging-markets/#.VXHG2P50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   faster than any other G20 nation  </u>  , </a>  including China.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-India-Growth-Forecasts-for-2015-2016-are-strong-06052015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"India-Growth-Forecasts-for-2015-2016-are-strong\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-India-Growth-Forecasts-for-2015-2016-are-strong-06052015.gif\"/> </a> <br/> This is growth that can be sustained for the long-term, a topic I wrote about  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/600-million-reasons-to-keep-your-eyes-on-india/#.VXHCGP50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   last October  </u>  . </a>  According to the  <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2015/car031115a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   International Monetary Fund  </u>  , </a>  within the next decade and a half, &ldquo;India will have the largest, and among the youngest, workforces in the world, and will need to create jobs for the roughly one hundred million young Indians who will enter the job market in the coming decade.&rdquo; By 2050, India is expected to be the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy based on purchasing power parity, following China.</p><p> Global investors recognize these positive data points and are piling into Indian equities, especially now that aggressive monetary easing in the country seems likely. CLSA&rsquo;s Wood points out that $737 million a month on average have flowed into India-focused mutual funds since Modi took office last May, a dramatic reversal from the amounts seen prior to that.</p><h3> Historically Low Interest Rates Help Push Chinese Equities Higher</h3><p> <br/> Indeed, rate cuts have been constructive for not only Indian equities but also the Chinese market. As you can see below, easing cycles have historically coincided with strong market rallies in the MSCI China Index, a proxy for China H-shares, or stocks of Chinese companies listed on foreign exchanges. H-shares are one of the principal ways our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/china-region-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   China Region Fund (USCOX)  </a> </u>  has participated in the current bull market.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-Chinese-Easing-Cycles-Have-Been-Bullish-for-Chinese-Stocks-06052015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Chinese-Easing-Cycles-Have-Been-Bullish-for-Chinese-Stocks\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-Chinese-Easing-Cycles-Have-Been-Bullish-for-Chinese-Stocks-06052015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> After three cuts in the most recent easing cycle, Chinese rates now stand at their lowest point ever, helping the index move higher in its quest to regain its November 2007 highs.</p><h3> H-Shares Half as Cheap as Chinese Domestic Equities</h3><p> <br/> Judging from the rally in H-shares, some investors might be concerned that the market is too expensive right now. On the contrary, H-shares, expressed below by the Hang Seng Index, are trading at a much cheaper multiple of 8.9 times estimated earnings to A-shares&rsquo; 17.4, a discount of 48 percent.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-China-H-Shares-are-48-percent-cheaper-than-china-a-shares-06052015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"China-H-Shares-are-48-percent-cheaper-than-china-a-shares\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-China-H-Shares-are-48-percent-cheaper-than-china-a-shares-06052015.gif\"/> </a> <br/> You can also see that both H-shares and A-shares have traded at much higher multiples in the past, evidence that the rally is not yet overdone.</p><p> When we compare this trading cycle with the previous major rally that occurred from June 2005 to October 2007, we see that the run-up has plenty of room to climb higher.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-Shanghai-Composite-Index-is-Outpacing-the-Previous-Major-Bull-Rally-06052015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Shanghai-Composite-Index-is-Outpacing-the-Previous-Major-Bull-Rally\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-Shanghai-Composite-Index-is-Outpacing-the-Previous-Major-Bull-Rally-06052015.gif\"/> </a> <br/> &ldquo;We might be in the middle of a bull market, not the end,&rdquo; says Xian Liang, portfolio manager of USCOX. </p><p> Like Indian equities, Chinese equities are attracting massive amounts of fund inflows. For the week ending May 27, global investors reallocated $4.6 billion to A-shares ahead of FTSE indexing.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-global-investors-reallocation-to-china-in-progress-what-about-you_06052015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Global-investors-reallocation-to-china-in-progress-what-about-you\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-global-investors-reallocation-to-china-in-progress-what-about-you_06052015.gif\"/> </a> <br/> Last Thursday, the Shanghai Composite Index  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/behold-the-power-of-buybacks-and-dividends/#.VXHfMv50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   fell 6.5 percent  </u>  , </a>  probably due to profit-taking. This represented the most significant correction since January, when the Chinese government curbed margin lending. It&rsquo;s important for investors to look beyond the short-term noise and recognize that any correction this cycle could be seen as an opportunity to accumulate.</p><p> Again, USCOX continues to participate in this bull market through China H-shares and A-share exchange-traded funds. This helped the fund achieve a &ldquo;golden cross&rdquo; in January, which occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-USGIs-China-Region-Fund-Achieved-a-Golden-Cross-on-January-2-2015-06052015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"USGIs-China-Region-Fund-Achieved-a-Golden-Cross-on-January-2-2015\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-USGIs-China-Region-Fund-Achieved-a-Golden-Cross-on-January-2-2015-06052015.gif\"/> </a> <br/> Such technical indicators are seen as harbingers of strong growth. This particular move shows that the Chinese market has the support it needs to maintain upward momentum.</p><h3> American Companies Buy Back $71 Billion of Stock in May Alone</h3><p> <br/> As for American equities, they continue their trend of rewarding shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. Last week I mentioned that the amount in buybacks is expected to reach a staggering $1.2 trillion by year&rsquo;s end, surpassing the all-time high of $863 billion set in 2007.</p><p> Stock market research firm Birinyi Associates reports that U.S. companies repurchased over $71 billion of shares in May alone.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-May-Stock-Buyback-Amount-was-Second-Highest-in-17-Years-06052015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"May-Stock-Buyback-Amount-was-Second-Highest-in-17-Years\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-May-Stock-Buyback-Amount-was-Second-Highest-in-17-Years-06052015.gif\"/> </a> <br/> One more compelling reason we find the domestic market so attractive, and offer investors the opportunity to participate with our  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/all-american-equity-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   All American Equity Fund (GBTFX)  </u>  . </a>  All of the holdings in GBTFX either pay a dividend or are currently buying back their stock.</p><h3> Countless Jets Will Need to Be Replaced in the Coming Years</h3><p> <br/> A final note I&rsquo;d like to end on is the sheer number of jumbo jets that will need replacing in the coming years as domestic airlines seek to incorporate smaller, more efficient aircraft. Manufacturers Boeing and Airbus certainly have their work cut out for them and, in fact, face years&rsquo; worth of backlogs.</p><p> <img alt=\"Domestic-Airlines-Seek-More-Fuel-Efficient-Aircraft-Older-Models-are-Put-to-Pasture\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-06-05/COMM-Domestic-Airlines-Seek-More-Fuel-Efficient-Aircraft-Older-Models-are-Put-to-Pasture-06052015.jpg\"/></p><p> Business Insider recently shared a slideshow that reveals what happens when airlines retire older models in their fleet. Many of them end up at the Southern California Logistics Airport, where they wait to be resold, dismantled or put back into commission.

    "content": "<p> Can I tell you about a very personal experience?</p><p> Last year, about ten days after the birth of  <u>  my daughter Julia </u> , my wife didn&rsquo;t feel well in the morning. We hurried to the hospital and as soon as we arrived it became clear to me it was dead serious. She was bleeding internally. After a quick medical examination, she had to go into surgery.</p><p> But the bleeding didn&rsquo;t stop. Another specialist came to her bedside and told us she had to go through another surgery.</p><p> But it didn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p> She had to be transferred to another hospital to go through  another  surgery. Can you imagine how she must have felt after going through three surgeries in six hours?</p><p> But it didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p><p> She became weaker and weaker. It was agony. Her lips were the same colour as her pale face and her body was covered in cords and wires. She had just enough energy to whisper to me, &ldquo;how are the kids doing?&rdquo; And of course I answered, &ldquo;they are doing just fine, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p><p> After two days of suffering, pain and lots of tears, the doctor entered our private hospital room and cleared his throat, &ldquo;I have some bad news.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Your wife probably has a bacterial infection.&rdquo;  What he really said was, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, but are doing everything we can.&rdquo;</p><p> The doctor gave me the feeling her days were numbered.</p><p> And I was scared, really scared, because the thought of &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. Well, it scares me again as I write this.</p><p> But somehow &ndash; and I won&rsquo;t go through all the details &ndash; she managed to pull through. She managed to gather so much strength in her weakened body to win the most important fight of her life. She fought like only a mother can, to stay alive for the sake of her family.</p><p> She won.</p><p> <strong>  What if? </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re a mother, this fight might not surprise you. The vast majority of mothers fight for their family. They are not trying to be heroes. They&rsquo;re fighting because it&rsquo;s their job.</p><p> Nevertheless, in the days and weeks after, I started thinking, what if? What if she didn&rsquo;t pull through? What if she  did  pass into the great beyond, leaving me with three kids? What if she didn&rsquo;t fight?</p><p> What would have happened?</p><p> Nothing.</p><p> Yes, nothing would have happened.</p><p> That&rsquo;s the worse part.</p><p> The next day, the sun would come up. The birds would sing. People would eat breakfast, go to work, attend meetings&hellip; and nobody would even notice my wife would be gone. The great wheel would keep on turning, and for better or worse, she&rsquo;d be forgotten.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s the point. It&rsquo;s not just the thought of my kids and I losing the most important person in our lives, although that&rsquo;s certainly gruesome. It&rsquo;s the thought of her being  forgotten .</p><p> But how can a mother be  forgotten ?</p><p> Well, they can&rsquo;t. Nobody forgets their mother.</p><p> And I think we can learn from this. I don&rsquo;t mean to trivialize what mothers do, but I&rsquo;ve come to believe that our job as financial planners is not all that different.</p><p> You see, down deep, I believe many of us have a primal need to be remembered, to pass something on to future generations, to leave some mark on the world saying, &ldquo;I was here.&rdquo;</p><p> I believe that&rsquo;s probably the most important reason you made the decision to become a financial planner.</p><p> Now, I know this sounds stupid, but let&rsquo;s think about this for a moment.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t you agree that there&rsquo;s something immensely comforting about knowing that you really matter to your clients?</p><p> Isn&rsquo;t it a reassuring thought that if you kick the bucket tomorrow, you will live on, taking root in the minds of important people in your life?</p><p> <strong>  What really happens </strong></p><p> Of course, most of the time no one seems to care about you and your financial planning service. No applause, no hoorays, no referrals, no nothing. And it&rsquo;s disturbing.</p><p> When you give your best advice to your client and you see your client doesn&rsquo;t act, you feel like  nothing has changed.</p><p> The good news? It  can  change.</p><p> You just have to realize your financial planning service by itself isn&rsquo;t a magic key to immortality.</p><p> If you want that, you have to be unforgettable.</p><p> You have to touch people so deeply and connect with them so powerfully that your ideas and advice are burned into their minds.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how.</p><p> <strong>  The Walking Dead? </strong></p><p> Have you ever watched people coming out of the subway, walking down the street, on their way to their jobs?</p><p> If you have, you&rsquo;ll notice that people are doing  nothing . Just watch this:</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SGPjUyVtTQw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-10-at-11.05.20-AM.png\" width=\"848\"/> </a></p><p> click to play</p><p> Look at them.</p><p> They&rsquo;re not even there.</p><p> Somewhere along the way, their mind and heart and soul drifted off to sleep, and their body is operating on autopilot, keeping them alive until something happens.</p><p> What about these people?</p><p> These people are your clients.</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t getting any referrals or compliments, it&rsquo;s not because your service isn&rsquo;t good, necessarily. It&rsquo;s because your clients do nothing.</p><p> Why?</p><p> Because they don&rsquo;t care about your service. So they don&rsquo;t bother to say anything intelligent about it.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why, if you want interaction, you have to wake them up. You have to break them out of their stupor. You have to pump some life back into their veins.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s talk about how&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Examine the patient for signs of life </strong></p><p> The good news is they&rsquo;re not all numb. They&rsquo;re  slightly alive .</p><p> Your job as a financial planner is to find that life.</p><p> You have to watch your clients. You have to talk to your clients. You have to study them the way a doctor examines a patient suffering from some mysterious illness.</p><p> Why?</p><p> <a href=\"http://boostblogtraffic.com/how-to-be-unforgettable/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Here&rsquo;s what Jon Morrow says  </u>  : </a></p><p> You&rsquo;re searching for a spark. Buried down deep inside, they have hidden fears, dreams, desires and goals, and every once in a while, those emotions will leap to the surface, giving you a clue about how to bring them back.</p><p> Just pay close attention.</p><p> One moment, their eyes are dull and glassy. The next, they&rsquo;re shining with emotion.</p><p> One moment, their skin is gray and waxy. The next, it&rsquo;s a glowing pink.</p><p> One moment, their body is stiff and awkward. The next, it&rsquo;s full of vitality.</p><p> It&rsquo;s like watching someone come to life, although that&rsquo;s not exactly true, of course. They were always alive. It&rsquo;s like they just forgot for a while, and they need someone to remind them.</p><p> That &ldquo;someone&rdquo; is you.</p><p> <strong>  Attach the jumper cables </strong></p><p> Leave a car sitting idle for a few weeks, and what happens?</p><p> The battery dies. Not because anything is wrong with it, necessarily, but because no one has been using it.</p><p> And how do we charge it up?</p><p> Simple:</p><p> We get a car with a fully charged battery, connect the two with jumper cables, and then rev the engine.</p><p> Well, people&rsquo;s emotions work sort of the same way. If you&rsquo;ve not been using them for a while, it&rsquo;s hard to get them started again, and often times, we need someone else to give us a boost.</p><p> As financial planners, that&rsquo;s our job.</p><p> Your clients are the dead batteries. You are the live one. Your conversation about the goals in your client&rsquo;s life is your pair of jumper cables.</p><p> The secret is knowing where, exactly, to connect those cables.</p><p> On your client&rsquo;s side, you have to connect them to a place where your client is at least slightly alive. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re just wasting your energy, which is what many planners do by just selling to them.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why understanding your clients is so critical.</p><p> On your own side, you have to connect those jumper cables to  exactly the same place  as you connected them to the client, kind of like matching the positive and negative terminals. In other words, what turns them on has to turn you on too. Big time.</p><p> Why?</p><p> Because, it&rsquo;s time to rev that engine.</p><p> <strong>  Rev your engine </strong></p><p> Look at any piece of great financial planning, and you&rsquo;ll notice it has a certain  electricity  to it.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not just numbers on a piece of paper. It&rsquo;s raw energy compiled in an intense conversation followed by a plan or roadmap.</p><p> Where does that energy come from?</p><p> You. The financial planner.</p><p> If you have ever seen a video or blogpost by  <u>  <a href=\"http://kitces.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Kitces  </a> </u> , you can&rsquo;t help but feel the passion he has about advancing knowledge of financial planning.</p><p> If you follow  <u>  Tony Vidler </u> , you can&rsquo;t help but feel his urge to help his customers get more customers.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve ever been to  <u>  <a href=\"http://adviseredge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Adviseredge  </a> </u> , you can&rsquo;t help but feel Baz Gardner&rsquo;s efforts to innovate the financial services industry.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve ever read a book of  <u>  Jim Stackpool </u> , you know he&rsquo;s in the race for delivering certainty to clients.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not a trickle of emotion. It&rsquo;s a roaring flood, a tidal wave of feeling that lifts you up and carries you along for a ride.</p><p> Not surprisingly, that&rsquo;s why those guys are popular. Because if you feel the way they do, it  charges you up.</p><p> So how do you serve your clients with that kind of emotion?</p><p> You rev your engine. You charge yourself up. You perform your battle chant.</p><p> Instead of sitting down and doing cold, rational, analytical financial planning, imagine the emotion you want to create in your client, and deliberately cultivate that emotion in yourself.</p><p> Then let it loose. Let it flow through you and into your service.</p><p> Your clients will feel it. They&rsquo;ll wake up. It&rsquo;ll make them feel alive.</p><p> And they&rsquo;ll remember you forever.</p><p> <strong>  How to be unforgettable </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s not about how smart you are.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not about the professionalism of your financial planning service.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not even about giving your clients tips they can go out and apply immediately.</p><p> It&rsquo;s about the way you make those clients  feel.</p><p> You want them to feel secure. You want them to feel inspired. You want them to feel taken care of.</p><p> But the most important part?</p><p> You want them to feel  alive .</p><p> You&rsquo;ve felt it with other art forms, right? You go to a great concert or play or movie, and when it finishes, you feel a little bit different? A little bit more awake?</p><p> Well, great financial planning does that too. Do you realize how incredibly precious that is?</p><p> It means you&rsquo;re not just here to inform. It means you&rsquo;re not just here to sell. It means you&rsquo;re not just here to persuade.</p><p> Your conversation with your client and your financial planning service can  change somebody&rsquo;s life .</p><p> After writing  <u>  this post </u>  one planner actually emailed to tell me his brain lit up every time he read one of my articles. I made him feel, like W. Clement Stone, Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino and Dale Carnegie made him feel. That&rsquo;s far too much credit for me I guess, but what&rsquo;s true is that my article gave him exactly the message he needed to hear, and reached him at exactly the right time.</p><p> Honestly, I feel better about that than all the money I&rsquo;ve made in my life. I set out to write a post that would affect people, and it did, maybe in the biggest way possible.</p><p> The point?</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s time to start taking your work seriously </strong></p><p> When you sit down to create a financial plan, don&rsquo;t think about just the numbers. Don&rsquo;t give your clients just another strategy.</p><p> Set their hair on fire.</p><p> Do it with so much passion and energy and enthusiasm they  can&rsquo;t  stay asleep.</p><p> Because that&rsquo;s what you have to do: bring them back to life. Maybe not forever, maybe not even for a day, but for an hour or two, give them such a charge they feel like a different person.</p><p> Do that, and they won&rsquo;t just move on, forgetting about you forever.</p><p> They&rsquo;ll give you a compliment. They&rsquo;ll refer you to a friend. They&rsquo;ll be happy to pay for your service. They come back for more.</p><p> And then you can shock them again and again and again until they find their spark for good.</p><p> From then on, you&rsquo;ll be their hero. They&rsquo;ll think about you. Not every day, but often enough.  You&rsquo;ll be, quite literally, unforgettable.</p><p> But the best part?</p><p> <strong>  When your time does come, you&rsquo;ll know you made a difference </strong></p><p> I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I pass into the great beyond, I won&rsquo;t be thinking about my assets under management, the number of clients I have or my saving accounts.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll think about the guy who compared me with Dale Carnegie. The guy whose brain lit up after reading my blog.</p><p> Those are the things that matter. Those are the things we are working for. Those are the things we need to build our entire businesses around.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here. That&rsquo;s why we matter.</p><p> So get to work.</p><p> Your clients are waiting for you.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s make financial planning matter.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Peter Drucker had an unparalleled ability to capture the essence of what&rsquo;s important in management. In 1973, he wrote: &ldquo;Because the purpose of business is to create and keep a customer, <strong>  the business enterprise has two&ndash;and only two&ndash;basic functions: marketing and innovation. </strong> Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs.&rdquo;</p><p> We all know, of course, that you can create and keep  unprofitable  customers and quickly go out of business. But Drucker&rsquo;s basic point still holds. Your purpose is not to &ldquo;beat the competition&rdquo; but rather to create great products and services that meet a client need and then cultivate your client relationships over time.</p><p> The question is: Why is it so hard for companies to stay focused on their clients and customers and make the investments that are necessary to create a consistent and differentiated experience for them?</p><p> <strong>  Here are some of the reasons why organizations struggle to remain client-centric: </strong></p><li> They have great products and services that practically sell themselves, and so (for a while) they don&rsquo;t have to worry about client relationships. Eventually, however, the party comes to an end if the service doesn&rsquo;t catch up with the product.</li><li> Being client-centric is difficult and requires constant focus and attention. Creating and keeping clients is not a one-off event, like re-engineering a process. It&rsquo;s an ongoing challenge.</li><li> Relationships are messy and ambiguous&mdash;they are part art and part science. People with deep functional expertise are often more comfortable dealing with operational or financial problems.</li><li> &ldquo;Client focus&rdquo; often becomes just another slogan or at best a one-off event. It is announced with fanfare but six months later some new initiative replaces it&mdash;quality, diversity, leadership, international, whatever.</li><li> It&rsquo;s not always easy to quantify the ROI for investments in better client service. It can be done, but often these are strategic investments that take time to yield fruit.</li><li> Complacency can set in and management can take their client relationships for granted. They get into a &ldquo;sustain&rdquo; or &ldquo;maintain&rdquo; mode and stop pushing and trying.</li><li> You can manage internal processes from your laptop or office, but dealing with clients often requires you to leave your office and actually go somewhere. &ldquo;If you want milk you have to leave your house and go out into the barn where the cows are&rdquo;&mdash;but people would rather sit by the fire than go outside, brave the cold, and trudge through the snow to reach the stable. (I&rsquo;m not comparing clients to cows, just using a colorful metaphor!)</li>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarryGlassman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Barry Glassman  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.glassmanwealth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Glassman Wealth Services  </u> </a></p><p> Recent college graduates are embarking on their chosen careers, but the vast majority has never had a personal finance class. Getting a regular paycheck after living frugally during their college years can be a heady experience that can quickly lead to overspending and more debt.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a great opportunity for parents and grandparents to give more than much-needed-money to their college graduates. Along with the cash, I recommend that you include one or more of the following financial gifts. The lessons taught here will set your grad on a course for greater financial success and could change their future.</p><h3> The Gift of Investing:</h3><p> <br/> One of the best ways to encourage investing is to give your grad money with strings attached &ndash; they have to invest it. I like  <u>  <a href=\"https://acorns.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Acorns.com  </a> </u> , a well-designed app that makes investing easy and automatic. Your grad can use your gift to get started with their Acorn.com account, then choose to invest this money into any of 5 different diversified ETF portfolios ranging from conservative to aggressive. From there, they can continue to invest their spare change rounded up from their credit or debit card purchases. There&rsquo;s a fee of $1 per month for balances under $5,000. For roughly the cost of one lunch out, they can be on their way to a life of saving and investing.</p><p> I also like the idea of opening a brokerage account for your grad and funding it with an initial amount that they can invest to buy stock in companies that interest them. Being personally involved will encourage them to save more and invest more, and hopefully, want to learn more.</p><h3> The Gift of Financial Planning:</h3><p> <br/> Nothing beats having a personal coach for learning the tips and habits to succeed at whatever you want to accomplish. The same is true of personal finance. Why not start your grad off with a personal investment coach from the  <u>  <a href=\"http://garrettplanningnetwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Garrett Planning Network  </a> </u> . I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the Garret Planning Network for a long time because they offer personal financial planning and investment advice at a reasonable cost. Buy your grad a  <u>  gift certificate </u>  and they can choose from a network of fee-only investment advisors to get them started on the right track to save, invest and plan for their financial future.</p><p> Pass along  <u>  Millennials and Money: The 5 Best Ways to Cut Debt and Save More </u>  which is full of fantastic tips and links to helpful resources for easy ways to track spending, how to save more and where to find good financial advice.</p><h3> The Gift of Saving:</h3><p> <br/> Set up a savings account with the money that you&rsquo;re giving your grad and continue to encourage them to find ways to save. That&rsquo;s the idea behind  <u>  <a href=\"https://digit.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Digit.co  </a> </u> , a relatively new online service that helps anyone to save. It&rsquo;s different from other scheduled savings programs typically offered by banks because it analyzes a person&rsquo;s income and spending habits and then determines when they have money that they won&rsquo;t miss. It sets aside those small amounts into an FDIC insured savings account. They have a no-overdraft guarantee and your grad can request that money be transferred back into their checking account at any time. In order to offer their service for free, Digit.co keeps any interest that&rsquo;s earned. Considering that most savings accounts offer almost no interest, this is a good deal, at least for now. This  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/review-we-tried-saving-automatically-with-digit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article by Digital Trends  </a> </u>  does a great job explaining how Digit.co works.</p><h3> The Gift of Creating Wealth: </h3><p> <br/> To become really good at handling money, getting out of college debt and getting on the road to becoming wealthy, give your grad one or more of my favorite financial books along with that cash:</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich/dp/0761147489/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430742371&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=i+will+teach+you+to+be+rich\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I Will Teach You To Be Rich  </a> </u>  by Ramit Sethi.</p><p> This book is hugely popular with millennials and anyone who wants to learn more about personal finance without the boring parts. Sethi&rsquo;s easy-to read and approachable style includes chapters like how to &ldquo;Open high interest, low hassle accounts and negotiate like an Indian,&rdquo; or &ldquo;How to save hundreds per month (and still buy what you love.)&rdquo;</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430742490&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+millionaire+next+door\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Millionaire Next Door  </a> </u>  by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko</p><p> This book is a great guide to the habits that build wealth. Based on the principal that wealthy people didn&rsquo;t become wealthy by acting that way, Stanley and Danko lay out the seven simple rules to follow to become wealthy. It&rsquo;s a must read for anyone just starting out and earning their first real paycheck because it teaches the basics of personal finance and helps them to develop good money habits right from the start.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Youre-So-Money-Live-Rich/dp/0307406199/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430742785&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=you%27re+so+money\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   You&rsquo;re So Money: Live Rich Even When You&rsquo;re Not  </a> </u>  by Farnoosh Torabi</p><p> Weaning off of their benevolent benefactors (parents, that&rsquo; you) and learning to live on an entry-level income, may come as a big shock to your grad&rsquo;s preferred lifestyle. But if they don&rsquo;t learn to live within their means, especially when just starting out, they may quickly rack up even more debt on those new credit cards.</p><p> Torabi, a savvy financial reporter and twenty-something herself, gives grads sensible advice to help them successfully adjust to their new disposable income level, and still enjoy some of the finer things in life.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Didnt-They-Teach-This-School/dp/1481027565/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430767006&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=financial+book+for+college+grad\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Why Didn&rsquo;t They Teach Me This in School?: 99 Personal Money Management Principles to Live By  </a> </u>  by Cary Siegal</p><p> The author originally wrote this book to pass on good money management skills to his five children. Since most high schools and colleges do not teach students even the basics of money management, this book features eight important lessons focusing on 99 principles that will quickly and memorably enhance any individual's money management acumen. I like this book because it&rsquo;s easy to understand and the principles are ready to use.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you are a financial advisor, you are in the relationship business. It&rsquo;s all about earning trust and developing a connection with your clients that can last a lifetime. Technology has changed the landscape of how people meet and connect. Because of resent financial scandals, security breaches and the economic downturn, people are just far less trusting of financial institutions these days, making it more challenging for financial advisors to meet and connect with their ideal clients. As a financial advisor you are faced with not only reaching your target audience and earning their consideration, but you also need to be able to distinguish yourself from every other advisor out there.</p><p> While technology has changed the landscape of how people meet and connect, it has also presented human to human businesses like financial advisories with a unique opportunity. Social media is the ultimate word of mouth marketing. It is the platform that fuels referrals and lets you share your unique perspective. Once you fully understand and overcome compliance concerns, financial advisors can embrace social media to build relationships and grow their brand. Here are some tips to get you started on the path of social media success.</p><h3> Clean-Up Your Social Media Accounts</h3><p> <br/> First things first. If you are currently using Facebook and Instagram for personal use, before opening your &ldquo;home&rdquo; up to your professional life, tidy-up a bit. Understandably, you may not want your clients to have full access to what you post on Facebook. Be sure to update your Privacy Settings and Tools so that you&rsquo;re comfortable. Also, under Manage Blocking in your settings, you can add people to a Restricted List so that they only see what you have made available to the public (per your Privacy Settings). Decide now if you want to use Instagram for professional use. You can post personal pictures to Instagram, but you&rsquo;ll be best served following a theme and color palette, as well as never going more than 3 posts without something that points back to the value you offer through your profession. Lastly, make sure your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date. LinkedIn is your professional impression, so make a great one with a quality photograph, updated information and some recent engagement activity. Be the professional the professionals you&rsquo;re looking to network with, want to network with. Catch my drift?</p><h3> Embrace Your Personal Brand</h3><p> <br/> Be yourself and have fun. Who you are matters when it comes to people selecting their financial advisor. The more honest and authentic you are online, the more comfortable and easy it will be for your ideal client when they meet you in person. People want to work with people they like and with social media, you make it easier for more people to get to know you and what you&rsquo;re all about. By being yourself on social media, you invite people to form a connection with you before they actually meet you in person. Definitely don&rsquo;t create an online version of yourself that isn&rsquo;t consistent with who you are in real life. Be real and be you.</p><h3> Connect with Your Clients &amp; Centers of Influence</h3><p> <br/> Make sure you connect with the people you know! Referrals are a great source of new business and there is nothing like a warm introduction from a current happy client or professional friend. Personal and professional life are more integrated these days. Now that you have your social media accounts cleaned-up, get connected with your current supporters online. They will be your best advocates for your brand and vice versa. Ideally, you will be creating and sharing content that speaks to the needs of your ideal clients and contacts. Your clients may not be able to write you a glowing review, because of compliance regulations &hellip; but they can share your blog article with their friends and family, which is just as nice.</p><h3> Use LinkedIn for Thought-Leadership &amp; Networking</h3><p> <br/> LinkedIn is the place to flex your knowledge and expertise. Be a resource to your network on LinkedIn, not just an inactive profile page. By sharing great content your audience would benefit from, you become a great source of information. If you are writing and using the LinkedIn Publisher feature, your original ideas are shared directly with your connections and people that follow you. In terms of networking, I recommend sending a personalized note to every single person I connect with or that connects with me. Personalized connection invitation requests are the best, although I must admit that the mobile app is really frustrating for being able to do that. I make sure I send a personal note regardless that shares my enthusiasm for our connection and a call to action. Maybe it&rsquo;s a phone call or a cup of coffee, or just a simple question to learn more about the person so I know what the right call to action should be.</p><h3> Start Tweeting</h3><p> <br/> Twitter is like Grand Central Station and is a great place to connect with influencers in your industry, as well as writers, editors and major publications. 23% of all online adults are using Twitter and that number continues to grow. Being active on Twitter will help drive people to your website or if you don&rsquo;t have a website, you can direct people to your LinkedIn profile. If you want to grow your credibility and expand your network, Twitter will help you reach your goals. I have also found Twitter chats to be one of the best ways to meet and engage with people on Twitter. These days, many of them run a live podcast and you can join the conversation live on Twitter. The opportunity is to position yourself as a thought leader and begin contributing to new conversations about your industry.</p><h3> Join Facebook Groups</h3><p> <br/> Facebook groups are great. Search for and join groups that your ideal clients are joining that way you can establish yourself as a resource to the groups you&rsquo;re involved with. Groups are highly engaged and with the right host, they provide plenty of opportunities to promote your content or your services in an appropriate and welcomed manner. Also, many people ask questions and referrals of their groups. Setting up some social listening alerts will be helpful to keep you aware of conversations that are happening that you want to join. You can set up your first alert for free with  <a href=\"https://en.mention.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mention  </u>  . </a></p><h3> Observe the 30/60/10 Rule When Publishing Content</h3><p> <br/> I can&rsquo;t emphasize this rule enough when it comes to sharing content over social media.  <strong>  30% of what you share should be owned. </strong>  These include blog posts, updates, inspirational quotes, infographic, etc. <strong>   60% of what you share should be curated. </strong>  This is other people&rsquo;s content. An article you thought your audience would like from The Wall Street Journal or a link to your COIs most recent blog post. It is other people&rsquo;s content, but it adds value to your target audience.  <strong>  And then only 10% of what you share should be promotional: </strong>  event announcements, consultation offers, introductory fee announcement, or anything that screams, &ldquo;Look at me and what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;</p><h3> Give Value Away</h3><p> <br/> The most important takeaway for financial advisors to succeed on social media is to give value away. Everything you post for your audience should go through a filter of, &ldquo;Will this add value to their life?&rdquo; To be the solution your ideal client is looking for means you already solve their problems before they sign a formal engagement with you. Thanks to technology, social media is a value delivery vehicle you can leverage every single day. When you consistently deliver value to your audience, the question of why someone should choose you and your services over someone else&rsquo;s is much clearer. By giving value, you are doing exactly what you say you do versus just saying it and hoping your ideal client believes you.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> A common question financial advisors and managing directors ask is, &ldquo;How do we reach our ideal client most effectively?&rdquo; Today, that question is easily answered. You can reach them on social media. The more important question everyone must answer is not how to reach them, but how to earn their attention and keep it! Approaching social media with these recommendations will help you accomplish just that.</p>",

    "title": "How to Avoid Social Security Traps",
    "link": "how-to-avoid-social-security-traps",

    "content": "<p> Social security is arguably the most robust pension program ever created. Not only does it provide guaranteed lifetime retirement benefits which are enhanced by cost of living (COLA) adjustments but it also provides benefits for spouses, divorced spouses, widows/widowers, children, children in care and disabled workers. On the other hand, the complexity of the program rivals that of the tax code. Social security is governed by over 2,700 rules which are written in a cryptic style that most CPA's and attorneys would struggle to decipher.</p><h3> This complexity can often times work against you when you have a dispute over benefits with social security.</h3><p> <br/> If you go into a social security office to file for a benefit you believe you are eligible for, but are told that you are not, what recourse do you have? Well, you can file to have your request reviewed by a supervisor and they will eventually get back to you with a decision.</p><p> It is always helpful, however, to be able to reference the social security \"rule book\" which is called the POMS (Program Operations Manual System).  Unfortunately, trying to identify the applicable code sections and then deciphering and interpreting those code sections is indeed challenging. Working with a social security advisor (someone certified in social security planning) may be well worth it as he/she can arm you with the applicable POMS section(s) to take with you to the social security office to support your claim.</p><p> I had a client who's wife had filed for her benefits prior to full retirement age (FRA). He had decided to defer his own benefits to age 70. I told him that, since he was now age 66 (his FRA), he was also eligible to collect spousal benefits while deferring his own benefits to age 70. When he went to social security to file for spousal benefits he was told he was not eligible to do so because his own benefit was more than half of his wife's benefit. I told him that the social security agent was incorrect. She was applying the \"deemed filing rule\" to his request but, since he had now reached FRA, the deemed filing rule no longer applied.</p><p> I printed out the applicable section from POMS and told him to go back to social security with this information and file for spousal benefits again. Although he had to involve a social security supervisor he was able to receive his $1,000 per month spousal benefit (worth over $50,000 from age 66-70!) that he was originally told he was not eligible for.</p><p> In another instance, a client told me that she had gone into social security approximately 3 months prior to turning age 70 in order to ready her paperwork so that she could commence receiving her maximum eligible benefits when she turned age 70. The social security agent instead insisted that she take retroactive benefits (6 months of back payments, lump-sum) and that she would start her benefit amount based on a start date as if she had filed 6 months earlier.</p><p> The problem with doing that is she would also be permanently reducing her lifetime monthly benefits going forward by approximately 6% per year. This is because she would forfeit the option to increase her benefit amount by an 8% annualized delayed retirement credit (DRC) to age 70. By starting her benefits 9 months prior to age 70 she would be forgoing a 6% permanent increase in her benefits (i.e. 9 months worth of DRC's to her age 70).</p><p> The issue here is that POMS assumes someone filing for benefits after FRA intends to file for any eligible retroactive benefits unless that applicant specifically declines retroactive benefits in order to preserve their DRC's. Unfortunately, applicant's are not typically told what their options are and these default provisions may often lock them into permanently lower lifetime benefits.</p><p> Therefore, in addition to being an enormously complex system, it is important to know that the default provisions built into the social security may not always align with your personal goals and objectives.  Knowing what your options are and working with a social security specialist who can arm you with specific POMS references may be the best way to ensure that your options are clear to you and you can confidently go to social security to file for all the benefits you are entitled to.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Content marketing is defined as &ldquo;any marketing that involves the creation and sharing of media and publishing content in order to acquire and retain customers.&rdquo;  For financial advisors, it can be a one of the most effective way to differentiate your firm and tell your story.</p><h3> Here are 3 fundamental tips to keep in mind as you plan your content marketing strategy:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Tip # 1: Make sure that your content is Authentic, Engaging, and Actionable </strong></p><p> First, you need to decide what you want to talk about, starting with:</p><li> What are you most passionate about and what makes you firm different from others?</li><li> Is there a particular niche or a unique client type that you best serve?</li><li> Who within the firm is best to tell your story? P.S. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the firm&rsquo;s principal but should be someone who will be fully committed to the role. <br/>  </li><p> ​Once you&rsquo;ve answered these questions, I suggest to keep 3 things top of mind when crafting your message:</p><li> <strong>  Be Authentic </strong>  &ndash; make sure you speak about what you know. Don&rsquo;t try to compete with or copy anyone else.</li><li> <strong>  Be Engaging </strong>  &ndash; Be sure your communication is clear and easy to understand for the reader. Keep it short-and-sweet; it shouldn&rsquo;t be an effort on their part to get the point of your story.</li><li> <strong>  Always have a call-to-action </strong>  &ndash; there should always be at least one takeaway item for the reader to walk away with, usually whatever the next logical step in the process: <li>  Download a whitepaper for more information&hellip; </li> <li>  Attend a seminar to learn more&hellip;  </li> <li>  Schedule an office visit to meet the team&hellip;  <br/>    </li></li><p> <strong>  Tip # 2: Pick the format that you&rsquo;re most comfortable with and matches your firm&rsquo;s culture </strong></p><p> There are so many ways to deliver content these days; newsletters, video, white papers, e-books, infographics, case studies, how-to guides, Q&amp;A articles, to name a few. Don&rsquo;t take the &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do it all&rdquo; approach, which often leads to a less than desirable results. Pick the formats that make the most sense for you. Then, do your research on best practices, plan your work in advance, and do it right.  If you have multiple contributors who will be delivering content, consider an editorial calendar, so the messaging is varied and balanced. Also, be mindful that the cadence you use is consistent. You can have different people telling different stories, but they should all still have a united voice regardless of the audience; clients, prospects, COI, etc.</p><p> <strong>  Tip # 3: Do your homework on the technologies and platforms available </strong></p><p> So now that you have a foolproof content management strategy, how and who will get it done? Whether you manage it in-house or outsourcing with a consultant, there are many content management tools and service providers that are readily available, affordable, and customizable for your specific needs. Make sure to clearly understand the features and limitations of the products before you pick one and then make sure to leverage to its full capability.</p><p> A few of the service provider platforms to be aware of are:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HootSuite  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TweetDeck  </a> </u>  &ndash; to help manage your social media</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wordpress  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Blogger  </a> </u>  &ndash; to produce website and blogs</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.verticalresponse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vertical Response  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.constantcontact.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Constant Contact  </a> </u>  &ndash; to create newsletter and email campaigns <br/>  </li><p> I think content marketing expert, Joe Pulizzi of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Content Marketing Institute  </a> </u>  said it best &ldquo;Content marketing is all about telling a compelling story&rdquo;. I hope these tips have helped you in thinking about how best to tell your story.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<h3> Research has shown that a mere 10% of clients actually open their quarterly reporting statements.</h3><p> <br/> By digitizing and automating the reporting process, firms can save big while increasing their own access to the reports that enable them to provide informed, proactive investment advice.</p><p> Halbert Hargrove Investment Counsel, an RIA with $4.08 billion in assets under management, created a integration comprised of CRM, ECM and portfolio management to automate a daily reporting process that grants its investment counselors access to real-time information on client positions and holdings. The app enables investment counselors to make informed investment and planning decisions and provide proactive customer service.</p><p> Early on, the firm realized that to be efficient and prevent errors, it needed to have just one point in the process where client data is entered and stored. That is why it has constructed its reporting workflow around its CRM system and has used integrations into the portfolio management and ECM systems to make the process seamless. Once a new account has been set up in the CRM system and assigned to an investment counselor, Halbert Hargrove&rsquo;s integration begins to realize its power:</p><li> The portfolio management system automatically generates daily reports through an innovative electronic publishing system that the firm created.</li><li> By integrating ECM with the publishing system, the reports are automatically transferred from the publishing system into the ECM system.</li><li> Then, the reports are automatically made accessible to the investment counselors through the CRM system, which contains a direct link to the daily report in each client&rsquo;s records.</li><li> At the same time, the reports are simultaneously published to Halbert Hargrove&rsquo;s client Website for online viewing via a password-protected site.</li><li> For those clients who choose electronic delivery of reports, an automatic e-mail from the CRM system alerts them that there is information awaiting them, thus completing a fully automated workflow cycle. <br/>  </li><p> &ldquo;By having this end-to-end integration, we can be extremely fast, efficient and flexible in responding to client service requests. Additionally, with the one point of entry for client data, we&rsquo;re minimizing errors,&rdquo; says JC Abusaid, the firm&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer.</p><p> He notes that the integrated system also makes quarterly reporting a much simpler process. &ldquo;When it comes time for quarterly reports, we can take the published, electronic versions and e-mail those out to the clients who have elected to receive them in electronic format. This helps reduce the total amount of paper and mail we create and, for some clients, we do not generate any paper at all.&rdquo;</p><p> In terms of ROI, Abusaid says, &ldquo;While we haven&rsquo;t put an actual dollar figure on the value of this composite system and what it does for us, we do know that in terms of scaling upon existing infrastructure, back-office efficiencies and the lack of filing storage &ndash; it has to be in the range of tens of thousands of dollars per month.&rdquo;</p><p> Similarly, North Carolina&rsquo;s Piedmont Trust Company has integrated its portfolio management, CRM and ECM systems to grant clients access to information via a client portal. According to Managing Director Ed Wright, &ldquo;The integrations were not costly thanks to the SDK and open architecture associated with our ECM system, which allowed us to create a customized Web experience for our clients.&rdquo;</p><p> For more examples of how top advisory firms are using cutting-edge technology tools to maximize operational efficiency and improve client services, download your copy of the trend report , &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/resource/white-paper-using-technology-to-drive-productivity-and-profitability/?utm_source=iris.localhost.lan&amp;utm_medium=ad-digital&amp;utm_campaign=6-9-15\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Using Technology to Drive Productivity and Profitability  </a> </u> &rdquo;.</p>",

Yet when we &ldquo;court&rdquo; candidates before hiring, the time usually ranges from just a few hours to a few months.</p><p> <strong>  Think about it: when hiring someone on whom your business&rsquo;s success or failure likely depends, you spend from just a few hours to a few months getting to know him or her. This is someone with whom you&rsquo;re going to spend the majority (over 60%) of your waking hours every week! </strong></p><p> Are there people in your organization who no longer contribute, who evoke in you the same angry response as Pat? It&rsquo;s time to rip off the band-aid and come up with a plan to move these people on and to hire the right people for the job.</p><li> Never hire out of desperation. Anticipate your hiring needs and take your time.</li><li> There are no rules governing the number of interviews or how long the process should be. You want to be 100% certain before you commit. Smaller organizations can&rsquo;t afford to be wrong. One bad hire out of 20 employees is a much higher impact than 1 out of 100. Include &ldquo;trusted advisors&rdquo; in your interview process, use personality surveys, etc.</li><li> When hiring for a key position, take the candidate and significant other to dinner. Bring your better half as well. Your partner&rsquo;s perspective can shed new light on the candidate&rsquo;s &ldquo;fit&rdquo; plus provide you with a back up &ldquo;BS&rdquo; meter. Likewise, the way the candidate and partner interact can provide valuable insight into how your working relationship might develop. Dinner is a great way to gain an understanding of a candidate&rsquo;s tendencies, influences, experiences, value-system, social skills, etc. You can often obtain &ldquo;personal&rdquo; information you&rsquo;re not supposed to ask in interviews. Of course, don&rsquo;t ask such questions during dinner, either; but trust me, the information will flow!</li><li> Possible questions to ask during formal interviews include&hellip; <li>  &ldquo;What are the five top values by which you live?&rdquo; (Be prepared and know your own for comparison and to see where the candidate&rsquo;s values overlap with yours. If there&rsquo;s no overlap, the relationship will not develop to one of complete trust.) </li> <li>  &ldquo;In your worst year of performance, what happened and why?&rdquo; (If there is no &ldquo;I&rdquo; in the candidate&rsquo;s response, this individual will not accept responsibility or accountability.) </li> <li>  &ldquo;What can you do differently in your current job to help you progress?&rdquo; (A candidate with no answer or who says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing I can do, that&rsquo;s why I am looking,&rdquo; tends to blame others for lack of success. The candidate doesn&rsquo;t understand that development and success have two components: the opportunity the employer provides plus the employee&rsquo;s ability to seize that opportunity.) </li> <li>  &ldquo;What type of environments support who you are and give you the confidence to learn and grow from your mistakes?&rdquo; (If the environment described is not similar to yours or is opposite, this will not be a good fit.)  <br/>    </li></li><p> Most importantly, if you have the slightest doubt about a candidate&mdash;despite the pedigree or credentials&mdash;don&rsquo;t hire. If it&rsquo;s not a fit, it&rsquo;s not a fit! Stop hiring and hoping!</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s your choice&hellip; </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> As a small business owner, you need to be able to process large amounts of information quickly, right?</p><p> And as a financial adviser, you need to do the same, surely?</p><p> Could these be two of the markers of intellectual capability separating smart business people from the rest? It kind of makes sense.</p><p> Turns out not. According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2013/05/24/the-key-to-a-high-iq-not-getting-distracted/\" target=\"_blank\">   2013 study by the University of Rochester  </a> </u> , being smart might just in fact be about the information you&rsquo;re able to ignore, rather than how much you can process.</p><p> In which case, could you running an even better business actually be about thinking less, instead of more?</p><p> To cut the chase of the findings, the Rochester studies revealed a strong correlation between IQ and smart people&rsquo;s ability to detect motion in large and small objects. Basically, the more test subjects struggled with detecting motion in large objects and the better they were at the small ones, the higher their IQ.</p><p> The survival theory behind this is it&rsquo;s not background movement that&rsquo;s important, it&rsquo;s the stuff nearby. Realising there is predator stalking you in the grass directly ahead is a damn sight more important than trees moving in the distance. Your ability to spot this means you live to fight another day, simply because you&rsquo;re focusing on what&rsquo;s most relevant and important.</p><p> Essentially, an efficient brain ignores the nonessential.</p><p> There&rsquo;s two aspects of this study that struck me as relevant to advice businesses right now.</p><p> <strong>  Firstly, </strong> we&rsquo;re living through (yet another) period of significant legislative and technological industry change. There is so much that you could be focusing on, but only so much of that really matters.</p><p> Perhaps advice business owners shouldn&rsquo;t be focussing on the shifting industry landscape so much. Instead, perhaps the key is identifying the 3-4 most threatening &ldquo;predators&rdquo; &ndash; or, if you&rsquo;re in growth mode, the opportunities you&rsquo;re &ldquo;hunting&rdquo; &ndash; you should pay closest attention to.</p><p> For example:</p><li> Do you need to get on top of your service offer and marketing message, to make sure your clients understand what you&rsquo;re offering and why it&rsquo;s important come FDS time?</li><li> Is your real threat the risk of losing staff to institutions that are once again aggressively recruiting?</li><li> Perhaps what you really need to be watching out for is the lack of efficiency caused by not having your most important processes documented in an Online Operations Manual?</li><li> Do you need to get your business up to speed in the technology space, before it begins to impact your long-term business valuation and proves too costly to catch-up?</li><li> Or maybe it&rsquo;s about the fact that as a tech-savvy business owner, there has never been a better time to have a go at launching your own app, online offerings or whatever innovation you feel could put a dent in the world? <br/>  </li><p> If you&rsquo;re in doubt which might be relevant, Audere&rsquo;s own free  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shipanalysis.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SHIP Analysis Business Diagnostic tool  </a> </u>  can provide insight that might go some way to helping you figure it out in about 15 mins.</p><p> The  <strong>  second  </strong> aspect of this study that struck me is about focus.</p><p> If it turns out that the ability to focus is one of the hallmarks of intelligence, then it also stands to reason that creating an environment that encourages you to do so would be an enabler of smarter decision making.</p><p> In the next three weeks I&rsquo;ll be doing what I try to do each quarter; taking some time out for two days away from everything. From the phone, from technology, from the day to day and from working  <strong>  in </strong>  my business. I&rsquo;ll devote those days to walking, thinking, writing and (I hope) focusing on what Audere needs to do to add greater value to our clients&rsquo; businesses.</p><p> With the start of the financial year fast approaching, and the pace of change showing few signs of abating, it&rsquo;s worth asking whether one of these &ldquo;Focus Breaks&rdquo; might just be useful process for you too.</p><p> Combine it with an offsite planning session with your team, and create a plan for the coming year. It might well be the smartest way to find the focus you need to make 2015-16 memorable for all the right reasons.</p>",

    "title": "5 PR Truths Across Any Industry",
    "link": "5-pr-truths-across-any-industry",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kk_mcconnell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kathy McConnell  </u> </a>  </p><p> There are certain PR strategies that are applicable to any business and simply MUST be incorporated into your marketing campaign if you wish to see results and make an impact on your target audience. Whether your company is a thriving RIA, a startup in the tech scene or local small business, below are five PR truths that will benefit your company and your bottom line if executed properly.</p><p> <strong>  Identifying and communicating a cohesive company story: </strong>  Give your company an identity by utilizing storytelling. When used correctly, storytelling is a powerful tool that allows companies to communicate their key messages to their target audience in a way that evokes meaning. Every employee has their own perspective on a company, meaning that every company has multiple storytellers. Use key leaders as subject matter experts, who can offer their own unique insights that will make them desirable to the media as sources. Know that it&rsquo;s okay to tell multiple stories as long as they convey the same key messages indicative to your company. To identify what your company story is, ask questions: How are we different than our competitors? What is our company culture? Where do fit within our industry? What are we doing that hasn&rsquo;t been done before? Why should a customer choose to do business with us?</p><p> Take Warby Parker for example. They sell glasses. There are many glasses companies out there, but they connect with their consumers in a personal way through not only their services, but the way their storytellers describe the company. Take a look at its  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/history\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   company history page  </a> </u> . They&rsquo;ve described the company as a rebellious spirit with a lofty objective. This type of verbiage makes the brand feel almost human, allowing consumers to connect on a deeper level with the company.</p><p> <strong>  Video is king: </strong>  The term viral video characterizes the shareability of this medium, and demonstrates its importance in today&rsquo;s news and entertainment consumption. Every company can benefit from the PR powers of video. Videos are easy to digest and allow your target audience to visualize the message you are trying to convey. As media professionals, we&rsquo;re beginning to see more and more publications incorporate video into their reporting, making it more important than ever to consider it as part of your PR and marketing campaign. When you produce your own video, whether it be with an in-house team or by hiring an outside vendor, you ultimately have control over the finished product. Video then becomes a unique tool that can allow you to tell your company&rsquo;s story in a creative and controlled way. As more publications begin to incorporate video into their reporting strategies, it is still a relatively new feature, creating a window of opportunity. We&rsquo;ve found that a lot of reporters are eager to get sources lined up for video segments and this is the time to step up and take a seat on set!</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8Cq9rOdKSQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   This video  </a> </u>  from M&amp;T Bank illustrates the emphasis the company puts on building relationships with its clients. Using the power of video, M&amp;T is able to tell a more impactful story of how it puts the community first and brings a personal touch to its business.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8Cq9rOdKSQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"M&amp;T\" src=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MT-300x165.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  The impact of thought leadership: </strong>  It&rsquo;s every company&rsquo;s dream to be on the cover of Forbes, but what most don&rsquo;t understand is that with the exception of a few very rare cases, that&rsquo;s not going to happen so easily. It&rsquo;s going to take work and time, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to take what might seem like less-significant opportunities. While you may not consider a two line quote in a trade magazine something to write mom about, these kinds of placements are the building blocks for a foundation of media coverage. A strong foundation like this will not only strengthen your presence in the industry, but will establish your company and its subject matter experts as thought leaders &ndash; a credential Forbes looks for. In addition to building a foundation of coverage through thought leadership, a mention is a mention no matter how large or small the article size or piece of coverage. Any mention of your company name, whether it&rsquo;s a one-sentence quote attribution, or a feature piece, will improve your company&rsquo;s SEO.</p><p> A great way to show off your key leaders&rsquo; thought leadership is through a company blog. Penn Mutual Asset Management&rsquo;s blog has helped its CEO, Dave O&rsquo;Malley, score media opportunities with some of the top publications. He pens his commentary on the markets every Monday in a recurring blog series called  <u>  Monday Morning O&rsquo;Malley </u> . His commentary here has landed him placements with the Associated Press, Reuters, USA Today, CNN Money, The Street and MarketWatch, and has earned spots in multiple CNBC television segments.</p><p> <a href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000362766&amp;play=1\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Dave O'Malley\" src=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Dave-OMalley-300x164.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  Importance of a social media presence:  </strong> News consumption has changed drastically over the last ten years with the advent of social media. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and now the next generation of channels, like Snapchat and Periscope &ndash; they all allow users to curate the news according to their own interests and tastes. Reporters, customers and potential customers all look to social media as the place where news breaks. With these social channels, for the first time ever, people from anywhere in the world with an internet connection can share their uncensored opinions on what&rsquo;s happening in real-time. Don&rsquo;t let your voice not be heard. There is no more-direct way to connect and engage with consumers than through social media. To use these channels to their full extent, proper social media policies must be put in place at your company.</p><p> Take a look at Forbes&rsquo; list  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ilyapozin/2014/03/06/20-companies-you-should-be-following-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\">   20 Companies You Should Be Following on Social Media  </a> </u> . Fortune also published their own list  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/01/16/social-media-superstars-2014-fortunes-best-companies-to-work-for/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Media Superstars 2014  </a> </u> .</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fancy-tweet.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"fancy tweet\" src=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fancy-tweet-300x200.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  Data draws interest: </strong>  If your company is in the position to monitor trends and produce data, use it to your advantage. Click through the Wall Street Journal and chances are, you won&rsquo;t find many articles that don&rsquo;t reference at least one statistic. These kinds of facts and figures are like the Swiss Army knife of a PR pro&rsquo;s positioning tool belt. There is data that can be used to support almost any argument if positioned correctly. Data draws readers and motivates them to act as they relate the numbers to fact. Data intrigues reporters who need an extra oomph of conviction to stimulate their audience. In order to stay relevant during a drought of company announcements, compiling original data is a crafty way to keep your company in the news.</p><p> One company who has this down pat is Zoosk, the online dating site. Check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.refinery29.com/2015/04/86209/most-effective-dates-by-city#.jwkvqx:kWQr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this article  </a> </u>  from Refinery29, the perfect publication for their target audience. It features results from a survey Zoosk conducted on the most common first date ideas in seven metropolitan areas across the U.S. The survey is titled, &ldquo;The Date Index.&rdquo; Study results are a great way to gain media attention. You&rsquo;re basically writing the story for the reporter with your own data.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.refinery29.com/2015/04/86209/most-effective-dates-by-city#.jwkvqx:kWQr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"date index\" src=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/date-index1-298x300.jpg\"/> </a></p>",

But there are three in particular that can swing the odds significantly in your favor if you get them right. Acing just one of these swing factors will seriously help you get funded. Acing two or all three will put you head and shoulders above most other pitch decks. Those three key swing factors are:</p><p> <strong>  1. Team  <br/>  2. Technology  <br/>  3. Traction </strong></p><p> Before we look at these swing factors, let&rsquo;s recap what drives technology investment decisions. Most investors are looking for startups that offer a significant return on their investment (typically 10-20x) while minimizing the risks that might limit that return. Those investment risks include Market risk (there&rsquo;s no market or customers for a product like yours), Product risk (there is a market for a product like yours, but customers don&rsquo;t find your product compelling or competitive) and Execution risk (you have a compelling, competitive product for a large market, but your team is unable to acquire and retain new customers at scale).</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at each of our three swing factors in turn and see what you can do to minimize perceived investment risk.</p><h3> Team</h3><p> <br/> The team swing factor speaks to execution risk. This is the risk that your team fails to acquire and retain new customers at scale in a startup environment. You can reduce execution risk by showing that your team has experience and expertise in one or more of the following: 1) Startups (Ie: Key members of your team have founded or worked for other startups. You&rsquo;ll score bonus points if those startups were market leaders and/or achieved successful exits); 2) Similar products and technologies (Ie: Key members of your team have built a similar product to your current product, using similar technology, for another company or startup; and 3) Similar markets (Ie: Key members of your team have successfully marketed and sold products into your current target market or a closely related market).</p><p> Investors are also looking for teams that include both a business founder (who drives the company and product visions) and a technology founder (who drives product delivery). You&rsquo;ll score bonus points for team members with brand names on their resume. And you&rsquo;ll score more bonus points if several key members of your team have worked together in the past. Note that your extended team includes founders and key employees plus advisors and investors (if any). Make sure you list them all to get full credit for the total breadth and depth of experience and expertise on your team.</p><h3> Technology</h3><p> <br/> The technology swing factor speaks to product risk. This is the risk that you cannot build and maintain a product that your target customers find compelling and competitive. Investors are looking for startups that solve big, painful problems with unique products that enjoy a sustainable competitive advantage. You must clearly explain how people solve their problem today without your solution, the issues they have with those current solutions, and how your solution resolves those issues for them. If current solutions to the problem you solve are difficult to use, slow and expensive, then your solution should be easier to use, faster and more affordable.</p><p> The technology that underlies your product is also important. Many startups develop relatively simple technology platforms that are easy to copy. Think Uber and AirBnB. These two great companies have executed extraordinarily well with solutions that are relatively easy for others to replicate. Investors will love your technology if it is hard for your competitors to replicate or, better, impossible for your competitors to copy thanks to patent protection. Patents for core aspects of your customer value proposition, pending or granted, are more valuable to investors than patents for peripheral aspects.</p><h3> Traction</h3><p> <br/> The traction swing factor speaks to all three risk drivers (market, product and execution). By definition, if you are acquiring customers, there must be a market (customer) for your product, you must have a competitive product that customers prefer to other similar products, and you have demonstrated enough operational expertise to market and sell your product to at least some of the customers in your target market. You have achieved &ldquo;product/market fit,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re making money and you&rsquo;re ready to scale your business.</p><p> Traction is typically measured and reported using acquisition, engagement, retention and revenue numbers (often referred to as key metrics) that you should share as early as possible in your pitch deck. Common traction metrics include customer acquisition cost, lifetime value of customer, total customer count, daily and monthly active users, monthly recurring revenue, average revenue per user, monthly churn rate, and so on. Showing that your key metrics are trending up and to the right will really help you. Showing that your lifetime value of customer is several multiples of your customer acquisition cost will help you even more because it is a basic prerequisite for a profitable business.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> Investors want to maximize returns while minimizing risk. A proven team reduces execution risk. A competitive product built using hard to replicate or patent protected technology reduces product risk. Traction, in the form of accelerating customer adoption and revenue growth, reduces market, product and execution risk. Demonstrate that you have aced one or more of these swing factors in your pitch deck will greatly increase your chances of getting funded.</p><p> About the Author: Malcolm Lewis is a serial entrepreneur, startup mentor and pitch deck coach.

    "title": "Banks Question Fintech Disruption ... And Ask the Wrong Question",
    "link": "banks-question-fintech-disruption-and-ask-the-wrong-question",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I recently attended a conference in America, where the audience of mainly bankers could post questions to the speaker.  During the digital bank discussion, here are the questions that came in and, purely because they are fairly common in everyday dialogue, I thought I would post and answer the questions here.  Most are related to regulatory stuff &ndash; it was a banking audience &ndash; but there are also some interesting nuances.</p><h3> What are your thoughts on physical-digital coexistence?</h3><p> <br/> Let's start answering this question by saying that most people are not talking physical and digital, but physical and digital channels. It depresses me that we still talk about channels, as I&rsquo;ve blogged often, as surely it&rsquo;s now just physical and digital.  Channels implies multiple digital services, rather than just digital and physical.  That&rsquo;s why I hate the word or thought or focus upon channels in discussing Fintech.  Channels means multiple, separate digital structures.</p><p> So then we get into physical and digital coexistence and, for the next ten years, we will be working more and more on making these things seamlessly integrated and easy.  The internet of things and robots, infomediaries and robo-advisers, will make life simpler and easier from a financial perspective.  As these things develop, we will be paying and transacting seamlessly and easily everywhere, all the time.</p><p> The result of these activities is that, over time, we will not even be thinking physical and digital, just life.  Life augmented by digital platforms that make our lives easier.  Our physical existence is simplified as we no longer have to consider paying for anything.  We just live and consume and receive by exchanging debits and credits occur through the air.</p><h3> How do you reconcile emerging, disruptive financial services players with an environment of increased governance and regulatory oversight?</h3><p> <br/> Governance and regulation is intriguing, and always a subject that is high on the agenda of financiers, as they have so much governance and regulatory oversight.   The emerging, disruptive players have no oversight, as they are creating new value exchange models.  However, as those models evolve, the regulators get involved.  We&rsquo;re seeing this right now with bitcoin and the blockchain, and we&rsquo;ve seen it before in any market that involves financial exchange.  A great example is peer-to-peer lending, where most governments are learning. As they learn, they understand and, as they understand, they work out that these markets need their own specific style of regulatory oversight and governance.   In the UK for example, we now have P2P regulations and P2P governance through the  <u>  Financial Conduct Authority </u> .  So the idea of financial services without regulation is plain stupid.  Financial services, and therefore all the disruptive new financial players, will always be regulated or shut down.</p><h3> Should the CFPB be looking at some of these companies?</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m sure the CFPB ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  </a> </u> ) is already looking at these companies.  Certainly, the Treasury, Federal Reserve and White House are.  I guess this sort of question is a little like asking: there&rsquo;s a new financial market, are the regulators ignoring it?  Of course they&rsquo;re not.  From asking for policy input  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/08/25/the-federal-governments-reaction-to-bitcoin-is-an-acknowledgement-of-the-dollars-vulnerability/\" target=\"_blank\">   in 2013  </a> </u>   to embracing cryptocurrencies, the CFPB and all the other government agencies are moving from concern over new developments to  <a href=\"http://efta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/strategies-improving-us-payment-system.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   using them  </u>  . </a></p><h3> Are we going through a Fintech bubble and when will it burst?</h3><p> <br/> Yes, we are going through a bubble but it won&rsquo;t burst for some time, as there&rsquo;s a long way to go.  We are seeing just a few players emerge with new models so far.  In payments, the likes of Square, Klarna, Stripe, Currency Cloud and TransferWise have emerged as potentially major and massive heavyweights in transferring value.   In lending, Lending Club, Prosper, Kabbage, Zopa, Funding Circle and more are all emerging as major new credit companies.  In fact, of the $13.2 billion invested in Fintech startups last year ($4 billion the year before, under a billion in 2012), two-thirds is being invested in payments and lending.  As a result, Goldman Sachs have forecast a fifth of bank profits disappearing in these areas to the new players within five years.  That&rsquo;s the reason why VC&rsquo;s are investing and it&rsquo;s not so much a bubble as building a new Fintech marketplace.</p><h3> Many of the success stories for digital financial services are consumer/retail oriented. How are will digital impact institutional business outside of improved risk and compliance capabilities?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s a false illusion to think it&rsquo;s just consumer and retail, but the media and commentators, including myself, focus on these areas as they are easier to digest and discuss.  However, if you look at commercial and investment banking then everything from Traxpay to eToro to Colored Coins to Ripple to Betterment to Nutmeg to Secondmarket and more are ripping through those markets.  In fact, Fintech and cryptocurrencies is as if not more transformational in investment markets than in retail.  Just look at low latency, high frequency trading and BATS Chi-X, if you want to see the impact there.</p><h3> Which segment should be a focus for digital for traditional financial players: wealth, business or consumer markets?</h3><p> <br/> This is a question for your own company, not for me.  You need to work out where your core competency lies, and then leverage and focus upon it.  The problem most banks and financial firms have is that they&rsquo;ve been trying to grow for the past twenty years from being monoline players to being universal financial firms.   That trend is reversing fast as Fintech companies are predominantly very narrow.   They&rsquo;re not even monoline, as they don&rsquo;t cover the whole line; they&rsquo;re more monoparts.  You cannot compete as a universal player against a specialist monopart, so you have to integrate the parts that are better than yours and combine that part with your core competency.  Is your core competency wealth, business   or retail focused?  That will then answer this question, as the other parts that you&rsquo;re not good at, you need to partner or purchase.</p><h3> Is there an institution you see doing many things right? Who are they and how are they moving where others aren't?</h3><p> <br/> There are several, but the main notable firms are ICICI Bank in India, mBank in Poland and Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  I note these three specifically, as they are case studies I use for how to transform a bank.  However, there are many other institutions that illustrate amazing innovation. These institutions generally have come from markets that are newer and unhampered by heritage.  Turkey, Spain, Poland in Europe; Brazil, India and China along with some other related markets such as Japan. Taiwan and South Korea.  Then there are the many other emerging economies including Indonesia, Mexico, Colombia, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.  In other words, there are not really institutions but business models from many emerging and developed players that are noteworthy.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Most financial advisors and wealth managers are masters of multitasking. It is a common phenomenon, though, that juggling with too many tasks can be distracting and stressful. It also hinders one&rsquo;s ability to listen attentively.</p><p> So, how can financial advisors reclaim the lost art of listening in today&rsquo;s information-centric age? Here are five crucial steps to follow:</p><h3> Filters</h3><p> Put aside all your filters. Don&rsquo;t interrupt. More importantly, let the other person, be it your client or friend, finish what they have to say. Set aside your personal thoughts and don&rsquo;t assume you know what they have to say.</p><p> Instead, listen attentively and patiently. Ask them questions if you don&rsquo;t understand something. Take a sincere interest in what&rsquo;s being said and practice active and reflective listening to make sure you not only listen, but that you understand.</p><h3> Behavioral Styles</h3><p> Rather than focusing more on a person&rsquo;s communication style, concentrate on the words they are using.  Behavioral styles come between us and so often, we judge people on their distinctive style of speaking &ndash; the pace, tone and body language they use. Be aware of this. Look past someone&rsquo;s style and focus on the meaning behind their words.</p><h3> Full Attention</h3><p> Pay full attention to the person who is speaking to you in person or on the phone. Maintain eye contact with them in person. Even if you know them well, pretend you don&rsquo;t know anything about them and focus on learning all that you can by being mentally present. Cut out all distractions &ndash; no reading emails or text messages. Don&rsquo;t be distracted by your own thoughts. Quite simply, don&rsquo;t interact with someone if you do not have the time or energy to fully engage with them.</p><h3> Assumptions</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions by making assumptions. Misunderstandings can contribute to many problems in any relationship. Rather than assuming what the other person means, talk to them to seek clarification. Ask questions for your understanding. Be specific and clear. For instance, instead of saying &ldquo;Do you want me to call you?&rdquo; to your client, say: &ldquo;Do you want me to call you on your cell phone next Wednesday afternoon?&rdquo;</p><h3> Prioritize</h3><p> Aim to be a good listener. Set small goals that you can achieve daily. Focus on active listening. Make it a priority if you want to recapture the lost art of listening. People respect the person who will listen and give honest feedback. Strive to be that person.</p><p> Reclaiming the lost art of listening in the age of distraction is no easy feat, but it is possible and essential to achieve success in your personal as well as professional life.

    "content": "<p> Yes, there&rsquo;s a science to selling and marketing. And yes, there&rsquo;s a book for that. Or 240,372 of them according to Amazon.</p><p> The science says you take specific actions. You return calls and emails swiftly (as a form of respect, not because your client necessarily needs it). You work ethically with the long-game in mind (because you&rsquo;re building clients/buyers and a business for life). You&rsquo;re consistently helpful (the rule of reciprocity says it will come back to you). And you share social proof (because we want what people like us have).</p><h3> Include all of these in your arsenal and you&rsquo;ve built yourself an excellent foundation.</h3><p> <br/> But to really take it up a notch (or seven) you need to layer on the art of selling you.</p><p> Because the art is where you inject your personality&mdash;your unique brand of expertise and delivery&mdash;into developing initial and enduring relationships with your clients, buyers and readers.</p><p> Think about that. Just like Jackson Pollock didn&rsquo;t copy Picasso, you don&rsquo;t want to replicate your icons. Learn from those who&rsquo;ve gone before you, but develop your own art.</p><p> How? You can start by asking yourself just four questions and then using those answers to test every step of your sales and marketing process.</p><h3> Who&rsquo;s your sweet-spot client? </h3><p> <br/> This is where exquisite clarity pays off in spades. Appealing to a corporate executive is diametrically different from attracting start-up entrepreneurs. Or restaurant owners, authors or doctors. You&rsquo;ve got to know EXACTLY whom you want to captivate to speak their language.</p><p> What&rsquo;s your brand&mdash;the experience of working with you&mdash;all about? If you&rsquo;re the high touch Tiffany of consultants, then you darned well need to look, act (and price yourself) accordingly. If you&rsquo;re new to your field, focus on attracting clients and buyers who are in similar stages. You&rsquo;ll learn together and you might just make friends for life.</p><h3> What moves you? </h3><p> <br/> Integrating what genuinely excites and motivates you into your sales and marketing can take you from ordinary to extraordinary. Your life passions make us see&mdash;and care about&mdash;you beyond simply business. Potential clients are watching&mdash;especially on-line&mdash;for cues that you&rsquo;re a real person. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if they use use one as their tipping point to buy you vs. your look-alike competitors.</p><h3> Who are you when nobody&rsquo;s watching? </h3><p> <br/> Make no mistake, THAT&rsquo;S who you really are. So if you are a dyed-in-the-wool introvert, don&rsquo;t try selling yourself as a ball of fire. Instead, sell on YOUR virtues. Like asking great questions, providing can&rsquo;t-get-it-anywhere-else thought leadership. Even the tiniest disconnects between what you say/do and who you really are sow seeds of distrust with your audience.</p><p> OK, now take your answers to these questions and walk yourself through literally every aspect of how you market and sell yourself&mdash;in-person and on-line. Think of it as a mini-audit.</p><p> Will your sweet-spot clients identify with your testimonials? Do you write your articles and blog posts with them firmly in mind? Will a quick landing on your website or social media PROVE that you are the perfect fit for them? And the clincher: does how you interact with them on all your platforms match how they&rsquo;ll be treated once they&rsquo;ve hired you?</p><p> Experiment with a few tweaks to master the unique art of selling you. If that doesn&rsquo;t move the needle, well maybe it&rsquo;s time we talk&hellip;</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbell99\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Bell  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://johnbell.typepad.com/weblog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Digital Influence Mapping Project  </u> </a></p><p> I just got back from my  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bma15.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first BMA event, BMA15  </a> </u> . This is the  <a href=\"https://www.marketing.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   association of B2B marketing professionals  </u>  . </a>  (TirelessMC Gary Slack pictured above) The hall held more than a thousand people from brands, agencies and technology providers. Informative, thought-provoking sessions from practitioners like myself (here&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/250167/data-drives-travelers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a preview of what I spoke on  </a> </u> ) were mixed in with the inspirational (like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.akadrewdavis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Andrew Davis&rsquo;  </a> </u>  terrific presentation on today&rsquo;s customer journey). Many speakers referred in some way or another to the need to think in terms of a &lsquo;buyer journey&rsquo; &ndash; one that is complex, bobbing and weaving between social networks, Google, terrestrial moments, and more.</p><p>  As usual, the best parts were the conversations outside the sessions.  Like the dinner chat that started with &ldquo;All this talk of the buyer journey is crap.&rdquo;</p><h3> What&rsquo;s right with the buyer journey</h3><p> <br/> The funnel no longer adequately describes the progression of a buyer from &ldquo;unaware&rdquo; to actually purchasing, but finding a neat, simple funnel-alternative that does describe how we come to purchase is just plain hard.</p><p> <strong>  We are all influenced in new ways and new sources </strong> - No big mystery that what leads to a purchase decision for a business buyer(s) or consumer is more complex today than the golden age of advertising. Andrew Davis in his BMA12 keynote painted the most plausible and laughable &ldquo;path to purchase(s)&rdquo; for a consumer inspired to eat (or listen to) meatloaf. The path can be long, circuitous, include many influences. It really is a journey. Google&rsquo;s view of the consumer journey to buy insurance reveals that it can start six months out. </p><p> <strong>  The journey describes many touchpoints and contributions to a purchase decision </strong> - B2B buyers consider 8.9 sources of information today &ndash; twice as many as a few years ago. We are all doing more research before and after engaging a sales person. We talk to colleagues. We inspect products at trade shows. We read expert posts on LinkedIn. And so forth. Gone are the days when a handful or less of communications intercept a potential buyer and drive that purchase.</p><p> <strong>  Everyone&rsquo;s path to purchase can be different with different influences - IBM </strong> , Salesforce, Oracle &ndash; all of the marketing technology firms &ndash; are promoting this notion of the connected customer and that we ought to be addressing millions of individuals&hellip;individually versus as &ldquo;target audiences&rdquo; or segments or even personas. Conceptually  this makes sense. What drives someone to purchase, repurchase, advocate, behave loyally is different</p><p> <strong>   Attributing a sale to a single event is incorrect </strong> - Rarely is there a single driver for a purchase decision. A journey view acknowledges that and aims to reveal the important touchpoints that a marketer can affect along the way. Understanding what has more influence in a sales-related action (my euphemism for all the actions we hope people will do &ndash; buy, buy again, tell others about the product, behave loyally) is the marketer&rsquo;s job today. Believing only in the last-click, is irresponsibly na&iuml;ve.</p><p> <strong>  The buyer journey is inherently more customer-centered </strong> - We all need to become increasingly customer-centered. And we need to be wary of just giving this aspiration lip service. Thinking and learning about your customer&rsquo;s concerns and experiences as they try to solve problems via purchasing products and services, demands curiosity and compassion.  It is the buyer&rsquo;s journey after all and not the path we aim to force people down.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s wrong with the buyer journey</h3><p> <br/> Like any broad concept, the &ldquo;buyer journey&rdquo; can be stretched too far. A conceptual framework can become the answer to too many problems.</p><p> <strong>  Direct marketers may destroy the idea </strong> - It&rsquo;s in a direct marketers dna to try and &ldquo;stimulate&rdquo; people with offers and other action-inducing communications. They focus on efficiency &ndash; engineering emails and ads to drive people to take the bait at the lowest cost.  Now with the customer journey, the promise of mapping all these wonderful touchpoints and building a technology platform to coordinate them is too good to pass up. But mapping and instrumenting individual buyer journeys may not be worth the extraordinary effort. In the time it takes to do this, habits will change.</p><p> <strong>  Focuses too much on touchpoints vs. the psychology of buying </strong> - A buyer follows an email to a Web page. Days later they read a post in their LinkedIn feed and follow a link to a blog post. Weeks later they Google a business problem and browse four sites with credible expertise. And so on. The temptation of a buyer journey-model is to just think of these as a collection of media touchpoints where your brand ought to be to intercept this buyer. It may be more productive to think about what the so-called &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; is trying to get done at various points in their journey. They actually don&rsquo;t likely start out as a &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; but as a business person with a problem.</p><p> <strong>  Without believable attribution, complex marketing against the journey will die under it&rsquo;s own weight </strong> - If we cannot measure and understand the contribution to a sale for the dozen or so touchpoints along a journey, we will lose our will to spend our marketing dollars against them. This is just the way the world turns. Now matter how good the model seems, if it cannot be measured, eventually we will give up on it.</p><p> <strong>  B2B buying decisions involve a lot of people and that&rsquo;s a lot of journeys </strong> - How many people inside an organization influence a buying decision? Four? Six? Ten? We know that the bigger the price tag the more bodies there are around that conference table. How do you manage to understand all those journeys and affect them?  </p><h3> It's the right idea</h3><p> <br/> The buyer journey is the right idea. We just have to decide how we are going to change our marketing practices to align ourselves. We could easily go full force in mapping out dozens of personas and complex journeys. Or we could aspire to an increasing understanding of the path people take from the glimmer of a business need to an actual purchase and then try our hardest to be genuinely useful to our prospects and customers.</p><p> Attending BMA15 was a good reminder to me that there are a lot of smart people out there trying to figure this all out. My best strategy is to spend more time with these marketers and hope some of their smarts rub off. In my estimation, this is a worthwhile organization and I plan to participate more in the future.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Great leaders are everywhere, and they are not limited to any particular field or industry. In fact, a good leader can be anyone from a small caf&eacute; owner to a popular politician. No matter how different their backgrounds and professions might be, apparently, all effective leaders have certain things in common. Now, this is what you should ask yourself, &ldquo;Do you have any of these qualities?&rdquo;</p><h3> They Exhibit a Positive Attitude</h3><p> <br/> A good leader acknowledges that in order for them to have a motivated and satisfied team, they need to have a positive attitude. They do this by keeping calm and staying positive even when things go wrong. They find a way to create a happy and relaxed atmosphere in the workplace as well.</p><h3> They Know Failures Are Inevitable and They Deal with It</h3><p> <br/> There is no way we could avoid failures, because they are a part of life. What we could do instead is to learn how to deal with them effectively. Great leaders don&rsquo;t panic, and they stay logical while dealing with the situation. They don&rsquo;t break down and let their team know that they&rsquo;re helpless.</p><h3> They Hold Themselves Accountable</h3><p> <br/> Good leaders know how to take responsibility for failure. They don&rsquo;t demand their team to be accountable, and they don&rsquo;t blame others for any failure. They don&rsquo;t make excuses and instead, they work doubly hard to find a solution to the problem immediately.</p><h3> They Help Those around Them Grow</h3><p> <br/> A good leader knows that it is important for the people around him or her to develop their particular skills. Great leaders believe that the development of their team members will not only benefit the organization as a whole, but will also boost the team&rsquo;s morale. They are also willing to share their knowledge and talents with their team.</p><h3> They Know How to Delegate</h3><p> <br/> Good leaders know that no matter how much they try, they can&rsquo;t do everything on their own, and they need the help of other in order to succeed. For a great leader, delegating tasks and responsibilities is not just a way to get rid of their own stress, but also to show their confidence in the skills of other people in the workplace.</p><h3> They Communicate Well</h3><p> <br/> Good communication skills are a requirement to become an effective leader. Good leaders have the ability not only to communicate verbally, but they also know how to interpret people. They also acknowledge the importance of implementing an open door policy in the workplace to encourage everyone to express themselves.</p><h3> They Are Committed</h3><p> <br/> A person who has  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/mentor-program-details/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   great leadership skills  </a> </u>  knows how important it is to stick to their promises and commitments. Also, a good leader is the most hardworking person in the workplace. He or she does not demand people to work hard. Good leaders show their subordinates what it means to have dedication and commitment to their work.</p>",

    "link": "how-is-content-marketing-changing-buyer-behaviour",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> How is content marketing changing buyer behaviour?  In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-content-marketing-and-how-does-it-benefit-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content marketing  </a> </u>  is not changing buyer behaviour.</p><h3> A brief history of Content Marketing</h3><p> <br/> The truth is, content marketing has been around for a long time &ndash; it all began back in the late 1800s.  In 1895, John Deere started publishing a magazine called &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.deere.ca/en_US/industry/agriculture/our_offerings/furrow/furrow.page\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Furrow  </u>  &rdquo;.  </a> The purpose of this magazine was to become a resource for his customers, and educate farmers on how to better manage their crops to become more fruitful business owners. John Deere published this magazine for the purpose of educating his target audience, not selling. By providing this magazine to farmers, John Deere wanted to become a thought leader and used content marketing to align farming with his expertise and brand. Clearly, this venture has been very successful for John Deere, which begs the question; was John Deere the original content marketer?</p><h3> Traditional Marketing Vs. Content Marketing</h3><p> <br/> What is changing buyer behaviour?  It is the distribution and accessibility of content that is effectively changing buyer behaviour.  The evolution of content marketing and the way it is distributed and accessed is changing the ground rules in marketing and sales. Traditional examples of content marketing which include direct sales, static websites, print advertising, brochures, press releases, catalogues, branded magazines, direct mail, radio and more, are phasing their way out.</p><p> Traditional content marketing saw a gradual evolution from traditional content (hard copy) to digital and social content marketing. The evolution of content marketing has eliminated geographic constraints as consumers can now learn and read about anything online and on their mobile devices, regardless of their location. &lsquo;&rsquo;Googling&rsquo;&rsquo; has become one of the most popular words in the English language allowing online consumers to quickly and efficiently search for any topic under the sun- in less than one minute. In 1993, we saw the birth of the e-book, which paved the way for corporations to create content and publish it to a wide audience. In 1998, blogging became popular and it wasn&rsquo;t long until bloggers opinions and insights were regarded credible enough to make the news. In 2003, we started to get social with MySpace, which was soon surpassed by Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Digital and social content marketing also includes content such as case studies, white papers, blogs, e-books, Infographics, Webinars, Podcasts, Google + and more.</p><h3> What does the evolution of Content Marketing tell us? </h3><p> <br/> The emergence and growth of digital and social content marketing means buyers are being bombarded with content and information overload on a daily basis. So, what can we take away from the evolution of content marketing, and the content overload trend, and how does this relate to Advisors in the Financial Services industry? First, let&rsquo;s look at some statistics that speak to the accessibility of content, and the importance of the new form of content marketing:</p><li> 92% start with a search engine when looking for a particular product or solution.</li><li> 64% of the sales journey is completed before a customer makes contact with a sales person.</li><li> 61% have an open mind when searching online. They do not know whom they will purchase from.</li><li> 50% of buyers create a short-list before they get to the stage of engaging a sales person. <br/>  </li><p> The evolution of content marketing has taught us the importance of having an established online presence and content marketing strategy. Advisors can no longer differentiate by service, price and performance anymore. In a world where the majority of the sales journey is complete before a consumer speaks to a sales person, people are choosing to do business with you because of your specialized and unique thought leadership, that is easily accessible online.  How can Advisors cut through the content overload?</p><li> Advisors need to create content that is unique, valuable and of high quality, instead of promotional, in order to cut through the noise.</li><li> Advisors need to create content that is about the consumer, rather then the business.</li><li> Content needs to offer the consumer content that is new and provides value to them, that will help to solve their challenges, and do their homework for them.</li><li> Content should evoke conversations and make people want to share it.</li><li> Advisors need to use their content to become thought-leaders.</li>",

    "link": "whats-wrong-with-wealth-inequality",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> On Sunday, I did something uncharacteristic, something I should probably do more often: I posted a piece of flash fiction, a sci-fi tale, on Wattpad ( <u>  <a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/136366461-endgame\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> ) and Author-Zone.com ( <u>  here </u> ) called \"Endgame.\" It's a dark parable about a quantum-computing project designed to allow a peek into the future.My hope is that people who take 5 minutes to read  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/136366461-endgame\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   \"Endgame\"  </a> </u>  will come away with a few questions to think about:</p><li> Is it possible (even in theory) for economic inequality to get so bad that, 100 years from now, one person, or one corporate entity, could own all wealth on the planet?</li><li> If 99% of global wealth were to end up being owned by 1% (or less!) of the population, but people's everyday lives looked pretty much the same as they do now, would that be just fine? (Assume, for sake of argument, that the top 1% obtain their wealth through legal means; not by armed conflict or violent regime change.)</li><li> If one person (or one corporation) did end up owning essentially all wealth on the planet, would that be perfectly okay, even if the person were an absentee owner (living off-earth)?</li>These questions, it seems to me, are important, because we hear an awful lot these days about wealth inequality (e.g., it's been widely reported that the top 80 people on the Forbes billionaire list own more wealth than the poorest 50% of earth's population combined), and we're sure to hear a lot more about it during the upcoming U.S. presidential election, yet no one has asked the basic question: What's wrong with wealth inequality, if no laws have been broken? Is it, in fact, wrong? Would it be wrong, even in the extreme hypothetical case of one corporation (or person) owning essentially all wealth on earth?<h3> I'm not here to hand you an answer. I'm just raising the questions.</h3>Here are two possible ways to look at the issue:<strong> Pro-Wealth-Inequality:</strong> As long as the wealthy have broken no laws and committed no acts of violence (armed robbery, war, outright coercion), and as long as the wealthy have abided by the agreed-upon rules of free-market capitalism, no one should object to wealth inequality (nor income inequality), and indeed such achievements should be heralded as examples of the system working exactly as intended. Anyone who achieves great wealth through legitimate means should be celebrated, not attacked, and a system that makes great wealth possible should be considered a just and properly egalitarian system that rewards hard work.<strong> Anti-Wealth-Inequality:</strong> Extreme imbalances of wealth are inherently inegalitarian and cause widespread suffering. There is no such thing as a free market, because markets are continuously distorted by the corrosive (and widespread) influence of wealth in political institutions, with the wealthy in command of lawmakers, etc. Moreover, economic exploitation of the disadvantaged is itself a form of violence (causing premature death through suicide, alcoholism, and a long list of poverty-related comorbidities, not to mention workplace accidents), hence the claim that great wealth can be achieved \"without violence\" is inherently false. No billionaire is \"self made\"; the hard work of thousands of ordinary people goes into the making of any great fortune. Etc.The first position aligns well with Ayn Rand and/or Warren Buffett; the second position, with Marx, Proudhon, or Balzac. Most Republican presidential candidates will go with the first position. Bernie Sanders will align with the second position. (Hillary Clinton will claim elements of both arguments; the exact ratio <u> <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TBD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TBD </a></u>.)Whichever side of the fence you fall on, my advice is: Do some homework. Read up on income and wealth inequality (so you at least have your facts right). Read Ayn Rand, read Marx, read Piketty. Learn how to separate fact from fiction. That ability will be critical in the months ahead.",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Jonathan Lee | <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ecova </a></p><p> As commercial energy consumption is concerned, our recently-wrapped  <u>  <a href=\"http://more.ecova.com/2015-Energy-Sustainability-Predictions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Energy and Sustainability Predictions  </a> </u>  survey paints a picture of heightened cost consciousness. On the heels of an especially volatile year in supply price movement, energy once again ranked as the top opportunity for cost savings and efficiency gains recognized by our survey pool.</p><p> The growing concern around the cost of energy is a global phenomenon. In February 2014, energy price volatility replaced global climate change as the &ldquo;number-one critical uncertainty driving the world energy agenda,&rdquo; according to the 2014 World Energy Issues Monitor released by the World Energy Council.</p><br /><p> While we&rsquo;ve experienced an energy cost reprieve heading into 2015, our survey of more than 500 North American energy, sustainability, facility, and finance professionals indicates healthy skepticism that low oil prices are here to stay. Most of the recent price declines we&rsquo;ve seen are a direct result of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries&rsquo; (OPEC) November announcement to maintain current production levels. The global economic growth outlook is also driving weak demand for petroleum products, leaving global oil markets oversupplied. This oversupply, coupled with OPEC&rsquo;s maintenance of current production levels, puts pressure on non-OPEC producers to reduce production to balance the market. </p><p> But the past 24 months of energy price volatility we&rsquo;ve experienced has hardened industry energy and finance professionals. This year, 60 percent of respondents to our survey expect energy prices to increase in 2015. As sure as the pendulum has swung in recent months, the high energy bills and subsequent budget woes that organizations suffered at the hands of supply price swings in 2014 are still fresh in our minds. Last year, our survey showed that nearly a third of respondents weren&rsquo;t prepared to handle supply price movement, resulting in stressed utility budgets.economic growth outlook is also driving weak demand for petroleum products, leaving global oil markets oversupplied. This oversupply, coupled with OPEC&rsquo;s maintenance of current production levels, puts pressure on non-OPEC producers to reduce production to balance the market.</p><p> The caution indicated by our survey is well-founded, because near-term market events bring the potential for continued energy price volatility in the coming years. Coal plant capacity will continue to diminish at an accelerated pace through 2017 as higher cost coal plants are retired, rather than retrofitted to accommodate new environmental regulations. Most of these plants will be replaced by gas-fired generation, so wholesale electricity prices will become even more strongly correlated to gas. This reality brings with it the increased potential for energy price volatility in the coming years.</p><h3> To prepare for the continued likelihood of this volatility, energy and finance professionals should methodically track accruals and variances in energy usage and cost on a site-by-site basis.</h3><p> <br/> This exercise provides key site-specific consumption data, creating insight into potential future risk and the actions organizations can take to avoid it.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also important that energy budget stakeholders&mdash;including procurement, finance, energy, real estate and facilities engineering professionals&mdash;are provided clear and frequent intelligence on organization-wide and site-specific energy consumption. Our survey indicates that the expectation for energy price movement varies significantly from one role to the next within any one organization, casting light on a general lack of communication of energy market and consumption intelligence. In the event of both global energy cost swings and regional/site-specific energy consumption anomalies related to weather or plant inefficiencies, the ongoing sharing of this intelligence will prepare the organization to make informed budget adjustment decisions. Planning for the mitigation of potential risk scenarios&mdash;such as a late-winter double-digit rise in natural gas prices&mdash;will calm the mayhem many experienced in 2014.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you haven&rsquo;t picked up  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.charleneli.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Charlene Li&rsquo;s  </a> </u>  new book,  <u>  The Engaged Leader: a Strategy for Your Digital Transformation </u> , I highly recommend you do so. Charlene is a well-regarded author and researcher on leadership issues, and if you&rsquo;re an executive, it&rsquo;s a must-read.</p><p> In a Forbes article recently, Li told a priceless story that I think epitomizes the attitude of many 60-something execs these days:  &ldquo;A CEO once told me, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in this digital stuff. I believe in leading people by going around, shaking their hand, looking them in the eye, and connecting with them.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;That is absolutely fantastic. I love that you have that personal approach. But you have 10,000 employees&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> You can&rsquo;t possibly shake 10,000 hands without digital tools&mdash;yet there is still resistance from the C-suite on using digital channels to &ldquo;be social&rdquo; either with their employees or their customers. In my opinion this is a huge mistake, and one that needs to be rectified sooner rather than later.</p><h3> The executive who continues to remove him or herself from digital engagement will eventually have that decision bite them (and their company) where it really hurts&mdash;the pocketbook.</h3><p> <br/> Li answers some of the common complaints that I hear from executives on this issue, such as &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time,&rdquo; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t replace face-to-face,&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s marketing&rsquo;s job,&rdquo; and my all-time favorite, &ldquo;Who cares what I had for lunch?&rdquo;</p><p> These excuses don&rsquo;t carry water anymore because today&rsquo;s executive has to know what&rsquo;s going on in and around his or her company and/or industry at all times. And the only way to do a good job of that is to learn to navigate the digital landscape and use those tools to listen, learn and engage with people at every level.</p><p> Gone are the days when a CEO could navigate his ship from the sanctity of his office, seldom speaking to employees or customers (except via a podium or a newsletter). Effective leadership requires a new, more personal level of engagement. People expect more from  <a href=\"http://www.sdl.com/about/leadership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  company leadership </a>  than a photo and a blurb in the annual report or a quote in a press release. They want to see and hear executives talking about issues that concern them. They want to know that the company they&rsquo;re doing business with (or that they work for) is led by real people with real values that align with their own principles and ethics.</p><h3> But does that mean we&rsquo;ll have to spend half our day on social channels making meaningless small talk?</h3><p> <br/> Of course not&mdash;but we can no longer delegate engagement to marketing and sales. We need to get our hands dirty and use social channels to first listen, then engage by adding value.</p><p> Another thing to keep in mind is that many people will engage with you vicariously by watching how you engage with others. The CEO who steps out from behind their brand logo to take part in social conversation accomplishes two things: humanizing the brand and lending social credibility to their companies as thought leaders. And his or her influence is scaled by the &ldquo;silent&rdquo; engagement of others who watch but don&rsquo;t immediately jump into the conversation.</p><p> According to the 2014 Social CEO Report sponsored by Domo and CEO.com, 68% of CEOs have NO social presence on the top five social networks, and only 69% who have Twitter accounts are actually tweeting.</p><p> These are abysmal figures&mdash;but there are some executives who are pioneering leadership in the social space, and Hootsuite&trade; names some shining examples that I think every executive would do well to emulate, especially these two:</p><p> Richard Branson: Founder and Chairman of Virgin, Richard is very vocal on LinkedIn and Twitter. Plus, he not only has millions of followers on those channels, but he actively follows and engages with thousands of people. His personal brand has lent a human face and touch to Virgin and also sets him apart as a business leader whose first priority is giving value.</p><p> Richard&rsquo;s LinkedIn Influencer blog is chock-full of insights for CEOs, and I agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment from one of his posts, Behind the Scenes: How I Write Blogs:</p><p> &ldquo;Every CEO should make a big effort to get online. It is a superb platform for seeing what people really think about your company, and gives you a voice to engage with them. Those businesspersons who embrace the rapid changes of the Web are those who will be in the best position to benefit from them. But more than that, they will have a blast along the way.&rdquo;</p><p> Doug Conant: Chairman of Avon&rsquo;s board of directors, and founder and CEO of ConantLeadership, Doug is very active on Twitter. What I really like about Doug&rsquo;s approach is that he&rsquo;s not afraid to use new channels (he posts Instagram photos too), and he&rsquo;s genuine. He thanks people who retweet him and isn&rsquo;t shy about being personable. Plus, he&rsquo;s actively involved in promoting social media use in business, and helping leadership understand the value of relationships through integrity. From his blog post:  <a href=\"http://conantleadership.com/leadership-words-to-live-by/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Leadership Words to Live By: </a></p><h3> &ldquo;Begin every interaction from a place of &lsquo;how can I help?&rsquo;</h3><p> <br/> When you start this way, your earnest desire to be supportive shines brightly. And, when you follow through by listening and being unmistakably present, people know you are truly there for them, not just paying them lip service.&rdquo;</p><p> More executives need to embrace digital channels as a way to lead by example because there&rsquo;s no turning back the clock to stay in our comfort zones. Social media is deeply embedded in the lives of most people you do business with every day. In order for companies to stay competitive, social engagement must become a top-down strategy.</p><p> Those who adapt to social engagement will drive more business and stay competitive&mdash;those who ignore it will not.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.returnonrelationship.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #RonR  </a> </u></p><p> This post was originally posted at Inside CXM</p>",

    "content": "<h3> &ldquo;If you gloss over your mistakes you are just another smoking hole in the ground.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> How effectively does your organization learn? How will you take your mistakes (and successes) and systematically turn them into better execution on the next project? And how can you improve your processes so your organization can consistently and predictably turn ideas into outcomes? One critical tool is the debrief.</p><p> The value of regularly debriefing all projects is a lesson I learned from the workshop and the book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060834161/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060834161&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theclidripra-20&amp;linkId=H3VAOIOYCH4YBJEI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Flawless Execution  </a> </u> . It is an idea lost on most American businesses. And one reason that most businesses fail to learn.</p><p> The daylong event is conducted by former military pilots. They teach military techniques and systems thinking to business leaders. One of their lessons is that every mission follows a process of brief &ndash; execute &ndash; debrief, and they have a specific procedure for converting what they learn into company-wide improvements.</p><p> In most businesses, projects are begun, projects are completed, and the group moves on to the next thing. There are clients to see. Hours to make billable. But without a systematic and consistent debrief, lessons are missed. Without asking what went wrong and how that affected the outcome, we miss the opportunity to systematically get better. The military does not make that particular mistake. At least not in high-stakes missions. You don't send a young man up into the sky at the controls of a $30 million aircraft without taking every precaution you possibly can to bring them both back unharmed. When the elite soldiers are performing in their roles, they are awe-inspiring. One lesson learned in Vietnam was the power of a systematic review process and how it could accelerate learning.</p><p> They discovered that most aviator casualties occurred in the first 10 missions. If a pilot could survive the first 10 there was a good chance he would survive 100 and go home.</p><p> &ldquo;As it happened, some squadrons were more successful in those first ten missions than others. What the Air Force discovered was that some squadrons did the full-on plan-brief-execute-debrief process, but some did not . Those that did kept more pilots alive than those that didn&rsquo;t. It was learned that not only was debriefing vitally important but that communicating the lessons learned&mdash; accelerating the learning curve &mdash;was enough to give a three-mission pilot the tools and skills of a thirty-mission pilot. It was all about survival. And it was that simple.&rdquo; <a href=\"///C:/Users/Steve/Dropbox/The%20Client%20Driven%20Practice/Marketing%20Materials/The%20importance%20of%20the%20debrief%20-%20CDP.docx#_edn1\">  [  <u>   i  </u>  ] </a></p><p> How do you accelerate learning on your team? The flawless execution crew has come up with a process they call STEALTH you can apply in your company. The steps are:</p><li> Set the time/location/preparation</li><li> Tone</li><li> Execution versus objectives</li><li> Analyze execution</li><li> Lessons learned</li><li> Transfer lessons</li><li> High note</li><p> <br/> <strong>  Set the time/location/preparation </strong>  &ndash; Make debriefing a standard step in your project process. Build the expectation that upon a specific benchmark &ndash; a day, a week, a quarter, or the completion of a project &ndash; there will be a meeting to review outcomes. Make it a specified length. Start on time and end on time. Make sure everyone knows what they need to bring.</p><p> <strong>  Tone </strong>  &ndash; There can be no rank during the debrief. Everyone is the same level. In debriefing sorties, fighter pilots actually pull off their names and rank that are attached to their uniforms by Velcro. The project leader begins the meeting by pointing out mistakes he made in the first person. From there, everything is done by addressing team members roles in the third person. No second person talk (\"you made this mistake\") or names (\"Joe was late in following up with the client\"). Observations should be factual. &ldquo;The paraplanner sent the follow up letter two days later than scheduled.&rdquo; &ldquo;The lead planner did not enter the meeting notes into the CRM following the client appointment.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Execution versus objectives </strong>  &ndash; Review the outcome of the project compared with the planned outcome. Discuss what was done rather than what was missing. We attracted 35 clients to the event versus the expected 50. The &ldquo;office news&rdquo; section of the current issue of the email newsletter solicited 80 clicks to our website compared with the 40 that were anticipated.</p><p> <strong>  Analyze execution </strong>  &ndash; Review the steps of the process and the results of each. Did each step go as the team envisioned?</p><p> <strong>  Lessons learned </strong>  &ndash; Most mistakes reflect a flaw in the system rather than the negligence of a particular person. If someone made a mistake, what root cause can be found in their training? In the process? In the checklist they were using? Look for patterns. Focus on the big things. Identify opportunities for the system to be improved. Those lessons can subsequently benefit all future projects.</p><p> <strong>  Transfer lessons </strong>  &ndash; Make a plan to distribute the lessons throughout the organization. Find ways to reflect them in smarter procedures, checklists, processes.</p><p> <strong>  High note </strong>  &ndash; Conclude the meeting with a positive summation.</p><p> This is a valuable approach for all your projects - implementing new technology, adjusting your client onboarding process, even some financial planning issues. I think it has particularly good application in your marketing efforts. Evaluate that client appreciation event &ndash; how was the turnout compared to your expectations, what kind of feedback did you get from participants, how many referrals came out of it? How well did the last public relations campaign meet your expectations of press reports and public inquiries?</p><p> Did you just start trying remote meetings? Gather the staff together and review them. Was the technology as easy to use as you thought? Was the clients response what you anticipated? What specific things happened in some of those meetings that should become standard for all of those meetings?</p><p> One exercise we take advisors through is to help them create a new <a href=\"/category/advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   positioning statement </a>  and then  <a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  test it with clients </a> . Reserve a few minutes at the beginning of review meetings and ask a list of predetermined questions about it. A debrief is critical. Do clients believe the statement is a good reflection of their own experience with the advisor? How well does it reflect what that client feels is most valuable about what the advisor does? Part of the exercise, of course, is to teach clients the language we want them to use when they talk with their friends to more effectively generate referrals. Without gathering that feedback and reviewing how those conversations went, you will not know whether the clients will actually pick up on that language and repeated to people.</p><p> Step six in the financial planning process is to benchmark your progress and make sure you are still on track. You can keep your strategic plan on track by applying that same principle to your business. And the debrief can be a valuable tool to help you.</p><a href=\"///C:/Users/Steve/Dropbox/The%20Client%20Driven%20Practice/Marketing%20Materials/The%20importance%20of%20the%20debrief%20-%20CDP.docx#_ednref1\"> [ <u>  i </u> ]</a>Murphy, James D.

    "content": "<p> In Bob Dylan's classic song \"Forever Young,\" the artist instructs us to stay young-young at heart, young at thought and young at action.  It occurred to me recently that this concept of youthfulness is a great concept to achieve success and significance in your practice today. </p><h3> The truth that really penetrated my thoughts was the concept of staying curious. </h3><p> <br/> Curiosity is defined as: \"an eager desire to know; inquisitiveness.\" Like a child, always ask why.  Always be interested.   Continuously seek understanding.  This trait will keep you young, but also open new ways of thinking, producing, selling and living.</p><p> What occurred that refreshed my view of curiosity and staying young?  While dragging the entire family out for a little frolicking family fun, it hit me.  We traversed down to the John G. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago from the suburbs.  Since the ticket line was long, I moved us up to the annual membership line and proceeded to purchase the family package annual membership.  I rationalized that with just one more visit this year, this membership would pay for itself. Furthermore, we were doing a good thing to support the animals.  Finally, I admitted to my son, the line is a lot shorter and I didn't want to waste time! </p><p> As new members, we were all handed our entrance bracelets for the day and tickets to a 12:30 pm show.  Honestly, I didn't really listen to the lady when she explained what the show was.</p><p> When it was about five minutes before the show was to start, I said to my family, let's go to this show.  My three teenagers groaned and complained without knowing what the show was.  I confess my wife and I looked at each other as to say, \"We don't want to sit and listen to some guy talk about fish.\" </p><p> It was my 9-year-old daughter who finally said, \"Let's go! Why wouldn't we go?  What is the show about, anyway?\"</p><p> We went in, albeit a few minutes late, dragging the teenagers behind the 9-year-old.  To our surprise, we were all amazed!  I'm not sure the last time you've been to a dolphin show, but this show was like no dolphin show I had ever seen as a kid.</p><p> This was a modernized musical dolphin extravaganza! It included a three story high multi-media screen, \"floating\" on top of the water.  It included video shots of the dolphins and beluga whales in action, movie scenes of them in the wild and multi-level screen shots of almost anything else that could create an emotional response as your eyes flipped from the screen to the real mammals doing amazing things in the water.   The men and women in, on and above the water were directing these creatures with amazing precision and grace - like acrobats in a circus.  It was accompanied by an acoustic guitar and singing trio that entertained throughout.  This was not the dolphin show of my youth.  It captured every sense and emotion possible.</p><h3> What lesson did I learn? </h3><p> <br/> Lesson one was because the tickets were given to us for \"free,\" we placed no value on them.  We were wrong.  More importantly, lesson two was because of the curiosity of my 9-year-old daughter, we all enjoyed the show that moments earlier we had written off as an inconvenience at best.</p><h3> What does this mean to you? </h3><p> <br/> Stay curious!  Ask the why questions.  Curiosity will lead you to more success and significant relationships.  Genuine curiosity will lead you to modernizing your own sales approach, creating an innovative solution, understanding your clients' needs and wants better, and enjoying relationships more while learning even more about life and yourself.  All because you stayed curious and were not afraid to ask the why questions.  If you believe you've learned enough, you've stopped asking why.</p><h3> So what can childlike curiosity do for you?</h3><li> Modernize your approach or your technique; open your mind to new ideas</li><li> Help you learn</li><li> Enjoy people more</li><li> Keep you optimistic</li><li> Love life</li><li> Be grateful <br/>  </li><h3> Those are the results that matter! </h3><p> <br/> Those are attributes that will change lives.  Those features arrive because we stay curious and ask \"why?\" </p><p> Let me close with some youthful words from Mr. Dylan's benediction as you attempt to \"Stay Forever Young.\" <br/> <br/> May your heart always be joyful <br/> And may your song always be sung <br/> May you stay forever young <br/> Forever young, forever young <br/> May you stay forever young.</p>Lyrics by Bob Dylan, 1974",

    "title": "Why Workers Quit Without Anonymous Employee Feedback Surveys",
    "link": "why-workers-quit-without-anonymous-employee-feedback-surveys",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There&rsquo;s an old saying that says people don&rsquo;t quit jobs, they quit managers. And while that&rsquo;s not the whole story, there&rsquo;s definitely a grain of truth to it. In particular, there&rsquo;s one area that will turn off even employees who are otherwise happy in their job: an unapproachable manager.</p><p> According to <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/182321/employees-lot-managers.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Gallup  </u> </a> :</p><li> 65% of employees who don't feel they can approach their manager with any type of question are actively disengaged</li><li> Engagement is highest among employees who have some form of daily communication with their managers &mdash; face to face, on the phone, or digitally</li><li> Engaged employees report their manager returns their messages within 24 hours <br/>  </li><p> There&rsquo;s a direct correlation between being able to ask questions and raise issues to your manager and an engaged workforce. It makes common sense too: managers who are unapproachable likely don&rsquo;t have a pulse on employee happiness levels. When employees don&rsquo;t feel comfortable going up to their manager with a problem, they just end up keeping the issue to themselves. And this isn&rsquo;t a winning situation for anyone. Issues never get resolved and managers aren&rsquo;t kept in the loop.</p><p> Clearly, a manager can&rsquo;t have a one-on-one meeting with every employee every day, but an anonymous feedback system can help carry the weight. The addition of anonymous feedback won&rsquo;t replace direct contact, but it is an excellent supplement to find the heartbeat of your workforce and be approachable to your staff &mdash; in particular for these reasons.</p><h3> Real Issues Aren&rsquo;t Kept Secret</h3><p> <br/> Even if, as a manager, you claim to have an &ldquo;open-door policy,&rdquo; many employees won&rsquo;t feel comfortable addressing real issues in the workforce. According to the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2010/06/debunking-four-myths-about-employee-silence/ar/1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review </a> , 42% of employees withhold information from their managers if they believe they may lose something by sharing. Essentially: fear leads to tight lips.</p><p> Whether the fear is real or perceived, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But an anonymous feedback system will help employees feel free to speak their minds. It&rsquo;s the comfort of not having a name attached to the feedback that allows employees to air their dirty laundry without a sense of fear &mdash; which is the only way real change can occur.</p><h3> The Power of Employee Empowerment</h3><p> <br/> When managers are consistently asking for your feedback in a systematic way, employees are more likely to feel included and respected as part of the whole. Feeling valued is a massive step in employee engagement. And it doesn&rsquo;t take much.</p><p> But if you start forcing your employees to provide feedback, things start to become inauthentic. So make sure your employees are doing this of their own will. And make sure they know it&rsquo;s for their benefit, not the company&rsquo;s. Doing this shows that you&rsquo;re genuinely concerned about their happiness, which reinforces the employee&rsquo;s sense of feeling valued in the workplace.</p><h3> Frequency Matters</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve all probably been in this situation before: you have workplace concerns or issues that are weighing heavily on your shoulders. But there&rsquo;s no one you can turn to, or you feel like you have to wait for the annual survey. There&rsquo;s a greater chance you would be pushed to your limits and quit.</p><p> But on the other hand, if you were frequently asked to anonymously scale your happiness level on 1 to 10 and then provide a brief explanation as to why, it&rsquo;s more likely to get prompt resolution on any concerns &mdash; something a yearly face-to-face review could never dream of doing.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a remarkable difference between waiting 12 months and not having to wait at all. The latter allows issues to be resolved immediately. The former allows issues build up.</p><h3> Peer-to-Peer Praise</h3><p> <br/> Of course, feedback doesn&rsquo;t always have to be of the negative variety. An anonymous feedback system allows employees to call out an excellent coworker, something that a manager may have missed in the daily bustle.</p><p> This fellow employee praise can be used to boost employee morale &mdash; collect any responses you get and send them off in a newsletter or call them out during a team meeting. It reinforces the idea that what employees do matters, not just to their managers but also to the people they work with on a daily basis.</p><h3> Saving Face</h3><p> <br/> One of the best practices to keep in mind is that you need to share your feedback results with your team or organization. But this isn&rsquo;t entirely plausible if names are attached. Who wants their problems with their colleague or manager to be known to the rest of the world? It&rsquo;s unsettling.</p><p> Keeping the feedback anonymous allows employees to let it all out on the table. This eliminates the need for people to play office politics or get shunned by others.</p><p> And with those factors out of the picture, people will be more willing to resolve issues together as a cohesive team.</p><h3> Steps to Take</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a notorious distrust between employees and their managers. But there are definitely ways you can ease this tense and gain their full trust. Keep in mind that this trust won&rsquo;t be bought overnight.</p><li> <p>  Be up front: Tell your employees that their responses will be truly anonymous &mdash; that any information related to them will be scrubbed off the face of the Earth. </p></li><li> <p>  Share the feedback: Show your employees everyone&rsquo;s responses at meetings. Once they visually see that no one&rsquo;s name is attached to the feedback, you&rsquo;ll start gaining their trust. Plus, doing this also fosters a culture of transparency. </p></li><li> <p>  Get them involved: Don&rsquo;t just keep the solution-finding process to leaders. Collaborate with your employees to find resolutions that resolve their pain points. Because in the end, it&rsquo;s not about you; it&rsquo;s about your employees. </p></li><li> <p>  Ask them again: In a perfect world, there would be no issues at the workplace. In reality, issues come up one after another. So ask your employees for feedback and ask again. You&rsquo;ll want to nip the problem in the bud. </p></li><p> It may seem overwhelming to constantly be accepting feedback, but when approachability is so tied to employee engagement, it&rsquo;s crucial to make the effort. An anonymous employee feedback system can help plug holes in the cycle and make employees feel valued.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> No matter what else you are doing with prospective customers, and no matter what they think they want, you should always be pushing to close the business and make a sale.</p><p> Really?</p><h3> Does ANYONE want to be the customer in that type of business relationship?</h3><p> <br/> The line &ldquo;Always Be Closing&rdquo; was made famous in the movie &ldquo;Glengarry Glen Ross&rdquo; in 1992, but it captured perfectly the selling mindset of half a century leading up to that point.  Several lifetimes ago when I first moved into the &ldquo;advice&rdquo; world and was a fresh-faced young thing eager to learn how to succeed (hard to believe I know!), I too went through all the classic sales training methods of the day.</p><p> The Impending Doom Close&hellip;The Alternative Choice Close&hellip;The Assumptive Close&hellip;..we were urged to roleplay and practice as only the young and clueless can on mastering bits of trickery designed to get someone to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when they really didn&rsquo;t want to. The whole idea of such &ldquo;salesmanship&rdquo; is to achieve precisely that: get somebody to do something that they don&rsquo;t want to do.  It never sat well with me, and I was definitely considered a slow starter with poor sales skills&hellip;my peers were racing away making more sales and picking up accounts way back at the start, while I struggled along for the first 6 months of my career.  A couple of years later I found out that my sales manager had been the only one in my corner for that 6 months, as Head Office wanted to fire me as an under-performer.  Funnily enough, by that time (a couple of years into it) I was one of the top 10 advisers for the company nationally, and most of the peers who had started out with me on that initial training had been and gone.</p><p> My way was the slow way.  I thought it was:</p><h3> Always Be Closer.</h3><p> <br/> Not always be closing.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to be a master psychologist to know that people hate feeling pressured into doing something.  People hate feeling like they have been out manoeuvred.  People hate feeling like they&rsquo;ve been tricked.</p><p> Being closer to clients, and getting to know and understand them better leads to better relationships and higher trust. They are far more likely to consider and follow good advice.  So Always Be Closer works for everyone &ndash; but it isn&rsquo;t the whole answer.</p><p> We definitely need to sell.</p><p> Selling is absolutely necessary when giving advice.  It is not about clever tricks, one liners, or pushing people into decisions they are not ready for though.  We need to use sales skills to get clients to pause in their hectic lives, and to think and plan when they otherwise would not. We need to use sales skills to open their minds up to different possibilities and consider alternative ways of achieving goals.  We need to use sales skills to challenge bias and pre-judgement without clients disengaging from the advice process.  Sales skills are critical to managing behaviour, and with guiding and coaching people to do things which are beneficial for themselves, but which they otherwise might not do.</p><h3> Always be Coaching.</h3><p> <br/> Forget the &ldquo;closing&rdquo; and focus on &ldquo;coaching&rdquo;.  The business will be done when the right solution is delivered to clients who are in the right mindset, and when the time is right for it to be done.  Closing, as part of the sales and advice process, should ideally be a complete anti-climax. It is not the highpoint of the advice process at all, but just another of the steps on the coaching journey.</p><p> The thing is you cannot be both a Coach and a perpetual Closer.  A Coach is there to teach, guide, and mentor others to achieve THEIR objectives &hellip;.a Closer just wants to get a deal done and move on to the next deal.  To build a valuable business with loyal clients who are continually taking guidance you do need to be constantly coaching simply because that is what the clients value and will happily pay for.</p><p> That is what they will thank you for.  So do that.</p>",

We&rsquo;re about to launch ourselves ahead of the pack. Soon our company will be synonymous with &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and everyone will look to us as leaders in the field. I&rsquo;ve invested a lot of my own personal money because I believe in this new project that much. And I want you to be my copilot on this new journey because that&rsquo;s how much I believe in you. Together we can take this company to the next level! Let&rsquo;s get this party started!</p><h3> Dear Boss,</h3><p> K.</p><p>  </p><h3> Why Your Torture Plan Will Surely Backfire</h3><p> Nothing feels more deflating than lack of interest in our prized idea. When we are excited by something we have invested time, money and energy into, that ownership mentality becomes quite powerful. Your lackluster response pops the bubble of excitement and also puts a stain on your reputation.</p><p> Remember this old saying&hellip;</p><p> &ldquo;Enthusiasm&rdquo; has the letters in it that spell &ldquo;team&rdquo; and without those letters you&rsquo;re left with &ldquo;nhusis&rdquo; and how much fun does &ldquo;nhusis&rdquo; sound like?</p><p> Does anyone remember that old saying?</p><h3> Maybe Try This Instead?</h3><p> Folks who flex their empathy muscle tend to have a special place in peoples&rsquo; minds and hearts. Empathy doesn&rsquo;t have to be just for sad situations, it can also exist for exciting situations. I&rsquo;m not suggesting faking it (because it&rsquo;s obvious and more hurtful when you fake it), but perhaps ask a question or two about it and see if you can muster up some support.</p>",

    "content": "<p> My youngest child will turn 17 next week. She is ready to be a senior and even more ready for college. She wants to go to a private university and we had a conversation about the angst she was experiencing regarding the admission process. One of the questions she posed was, &ldquo;Will my social media accounts help me or hurt me when I apply, Mom?&rdquo; <strong>  Talk about long-term planning! </strong></p><p> The question is not only extremely relevant with the college application process going on all over the United States, but truly long term as children think about getting &ldquo;real&rdquo; jobs after they graduate. Can they clean up their profiles? Is it simply a process of improving privacy parameters? What about deleting unsavory photos? Let&rsquo;s discuss.</p><h3> Cleaning Up Your Profile</h3><p> <br/> According to the  <a href=\"http://press.kaptest.com/press-releases/kaplan-test-prep-survey-percentage-of-college-admissions-officers-who-visit-applicants-social-networking-pages-continues-to-grow-but-most-students-shrug\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kaplan Test Prep Survey  </u>    </a> (Nov 2014) over a third (35%) of college admissions officers have visited an applicant&rsquo;s social media page to learn more about them. This is higher than I thought it would be and lends one to heavily consider cleaning up their profile. Many colleges today want a more well-rounded culture of students and that means stalking students&rsquo; profiles to make sure they fit the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the school not only when on campus, but especially when off.</p><p> One&rsquo;s character may be in question when looking at comments and photos. This is why it&rsquo;s important to think about what you do reply to&hellip;and maybe reply a lot less publicly on things. Especially when there are heated discussions, name calling or fighting; they can be seen as an aggressive behavior and a school may think &ndash; yeah, this one&rsquo;s gonna cause a raucous at school, no thanks.</p><p> Something else you may not be considering is grammar and spelling.  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3510967/jobvite-social-media-profiles-job-applicants/\" target=\"_blank\">   Jobvite held a survey  </a> </u>  and 66% of hiring managers said they held this against candidates looking for a job. Imagine a teen headed to school for journalism or video production. Spelling matters!</p><p> I&rsquo;m not one who believes in censoring others. If you&rsquo;ve got something to say, feel free to say it. Just understand owning those words, pictures, etc. may come with consequences. I&rsquo;m also not saying it&rsquo;s right to judge someone by certain comments possibly taken out of context, but know the practice of profile reviews exists and make an educated decision as a family on what these admissions officers will see and the impact it could have on a pending application.</p><h3> Beefing Up Privacy Parameters</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a lot to be said for the &ldquo;world wide web&rdquo; and any button that says &ldquo;publish&rdquo; or &ldquo;post&rdquo;. Once you do, imagine whatever you just shared on a highway billboard for Grandma Mary to see. If you feel good about her seeing it and reading it, then you probably have a good thing there. If you would rather die than have her see something, then there&rsquo;s your sign that you shouldn&rsquo;t. Too easy, right?</p><p> Can you really expect anything you post on the internet to be &ldquo;private&rdquo;? I say absolutely not. If you put it out there, it&rsquo;s a free for all. Snapchat is an easy target where people think something they published will disappear in 15 seconds. Are your crazy? Just screenshot that snap and it&rsquo;s marked in history forever.</p><p> I strongly suggest setting personal profiles such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat to the highest privacy parameters. It&rsquo;s just a safe thing to do for a child anyway, but this will make it a little more difficult to permeate their accounts. Someone may be deterred in trying to get around the privacy settings. Every graduating teen should have a LinkedIn profile with a strong profile picture and filled out reasonably well and heavily edited.</p><h3> But First, Let Me Take a Selfie</h3><p> <br/> Photos in and of themselves are not the issue. Teens can take selfies with their friends, post about a great football game and share pics of their meals. It&rsquo;s when the pictures and videos show risque behavior, violent tendencies and shaming others that schools begin to think twice about entry to their campus.</p><p> Colleges want to avoid potential problems and lawsuits. Taking a quick peek at an applicant&rsquo;s YouTube channel, Snapchat account and Twitter feed may tell a lot about someone. I recently visited a friend&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s Twitter profile that had a reference to marijuana in it. The parents had no idea it was there and when brought to their attention were mortified.</p><p> Be gentle with the kids when you have these conversations too. The pressure to be cool, fashionable and carefree is extremely high for them. Children&rsquo;s lives are on display for the whole world to see and pass judgment. Helping them understand you have their best interest at heart and their long-term plans in mind may help them realize how important our social presence is in important decisions like a college acceptance.</p><p> Be Bigger, Better and more BIONIC!</p>",

Well, FICA is also getting a cut of your pay, likely near 8%, so we want you to know where your money is going...</p><p> First off, FICA stands for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, which established the tax that you and your employer pay to fund the Social Security and Medicare systems that support us in old age.  Your employer withholds 1.45% of all your wages for Medicare, 6.2% on your first $118,500 of wages for Social Security (in 2015) and then kicks in a matching amount for each on your behalf.</p><p> Knowing that you shouldn&rsquo;t have the 6.2% withheld for Social Security on more than your first $118,500 of wages is important for those of you that have side gigs or switch jobs mid-year.  If you withhold from both jobs, you could end up overpaying.  While you can request a refund if you overpay, you can avoid this interest-free loan to the government just by making sure you let your multiple employers know what&rsquo;s already been withheld.  </p><p> Not a Subscriber?   <u>  <a href=\"https://app.e2ma.net/app2/audience/signup/1770810/1714656/?v=a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SUBSCRIBE HERE  </a> </u>  for our weekly email. <strong>    </strong></p>",

    "content": "<h3> The stall, &ldquo;I need to speak with someone&rdquo; is as old as &ldquo;The price is too high&rdquo; objection. </h3><p> <br/> Despite it being around before all sales reps working today were born, most still have trouble overcoming it.  You&rsquo;d think that with all the good rebuttals and techniques that have been written for it they might have figured it out, but, alas, most reps still struggle with it. </p><p> To help you finally and definitively deal with it, I present you five new, improved and proven ways of handling this stall.  Now, let me make something clear: these techniques won&rsquo;t always work at overcoming this stall (sometimes they will, though!), but they will let you know how much of a stall this put off is, whether or not it&rsquo;s a smokescreen, and how much of a shot you have at overcoming it, side-stepping it, or setting yourself up for a successful next call (or if there should even be a next call with a prospect).</p><p> So let&rsquo;s start at the beginning.  The first thing you need to do is qualify for this stall during your opening call.  Do you?  If you don&rsquo;t, then you&rsquo;re likely to keep getting this at the end of your presentations and, oh, how frustrating that must be for you.  If you get it once, then shame on them, but if you keep getting it over and over again, then shame on you.  Here&rsquo;s what you must be asking on your first call:</p><p> &ldquo;And _________, besides yourself, who weighs in on the final decision on something like this?&rdquo;</p><p> And if they tell you their boss or corporate, etc., then you must layer that with:</p><p> &ldquo;And how much influence do you have in that?&rdquo;</p><p> And,</p><p> &ldquo;And what do they usually do when you bring them something like this?&rdquo;</p><p> And</p><p> &ldquo;Based on what you know about how they feel about something like this, what do you honestly think they would do?&rdquo;</p><p> Etc.  You must get as much clarity as you can upfront so you know what to expect when you go into your demo or presentation.  And, of course, as you begin your close, you must also preface it with:</p><p> &ldquo;And before we get started here, just so we&rsquo;re on the same page, if you like what you see at the end of our presentation today, what are the next steps for putting to work for you on your end?&rdquo;</p><p> OR,</p><p> &ldquo;At the end of our presentation today, if you like what you see, can you put us to work for you today?&rdquo;</p><p> Again, you must have clarity over the process before you begin your presentation.  Once you have that, however, if you still get the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to show this to my partner, boss, etc.,&rdquo; then use one of the proven scripts below to handle it.  As always, adjust it, customize it, and make it your own, and then practice, drill and rehearse it until you&rsquo;ve got it down.</p><p> &ldquo;I need to talk to my boss/partner/corporate&rdquo; etc.</p><h3> Response One:</h3><p> &ldquo;No problem, and are you going to recommend this to them?&rdquo;</p><p> [If Yes]</p><p> &ldquo;Great!  Then I&rsquo;ll hold on while you check with them&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Great!  And as you mentioned earlier, they do usually go with your recommendation, right?&rdquo;</p><p> [If Yes]</p><p> &ldquo;Wonderful.  Then I&rsquo;ll go ahead and get the paperwork started on my end &ndash; can you reach out and see if they&rsquo;re available now to run this by them?&rdquo;</p><p> [Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the simplicity of this technique!  About 20% of the time, the decision maker is sitting in the next room and some people will go and get the approval right then and save you valuable time in delaying and following up&hellip;]</p><h3> Response Two:</h3><p> &ldquo;I understand.  Let me ask you two things:  One: What do you think the biggest reason is they will put us to work for you today?&rdquo;</p><p> [Listen for the buying motive]</p><p> &ldquo;And two: What do you think is the biggest reason they won&rsquo;t go with this solution?&rdquo;</p><p> [Listen for what the real objection is and then layer and explore&hellip;]</p><h3> Response Three:</h3><p> \"Of course and I understand &ndash; we talked before about your decision process.  Let me ask you this, though: is getting their approval the ONLY thing holding us back from doing business together?&rdquo;</p><p> [Listen carefully &ndash; if YES then]:</p><p> &ldquo;Will you have time to talk to them before we next speak at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon?  Great!  Then because you&rsquo;re onboard with this, I&rsquo;ll go ahead and prepare the paperwork, I&rsquo;ll email it to you, and I&rsquo;ll even reserve a spot for you.&rdquo;</p><p> [Give a brief pause here and wait for push back.  If none]:</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look forward to us moving forward tomorrow!&rdquo;</p><h3> Response Four:</h3><p> &ldquo;I understand _________.&rdquo;  Tell you what I&rsquo;d be happy to do:  I know you&rsquo;re behind this, right?  Well, it&rsquo;s not fair to ask you to do my job, so if it&rsquo;s all right with you, I&rsquo;ll be happy to reach out to (decision maker) directly and answer any questions they might have &ndash; would that be O.K.?&rdquo;</p><p> [If NO]</p><p> &ldquo;No problem.  Just out of curiosity, do you think they will go with this?&rdquo;</p><p> [If NO or Don&rsquo;t Know]:</p><p> &ldquo;What would it take for them to say yes?&rdquo;</p><h3> Response Five:</h3><p> &ldquo;Well, I know you&rsquo;re behind this, and I know you need it &ndash; as we discussed during out first phone call.  I know you&rsquo;ve tried to sell or buy something in the past, and you&rsquo;ve probably been told that someone had to &ldquo;talk to someone else&rdquo; before, right?</p><p> [Wait for a response]</p><p> &ldquo;Well, based on your experience, what do you honestly think is going to happen here?&rdquo;</p><h3> Response Six:</h3><p> &ldquo;I understand.  __________, I&rsquo;ve been in sales a long time, and when someone tells me they have to speak with someone, it either means they really do, or it means they don&rsquo;t really have to, and it&rsquo;s just a way to get me off the phone.  I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s happening here, but if it is, can you level with me?&rdquo;</p><p> [If they really do have to speak with someone, then]</p><p> &ldquo;Thanks for that.  Now, based on what you know about this, and based on the fact that you&rsquo;d like to see us work together, what do you seriously think is going to stand in the way of this getting approved?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Thanks for that.  Now, based on what you know about this, and based on the fact that you&rsquo;d like to see us work together, what do you seriously think it&rsquo;s going to take to get this approved?&rdquo;</p><p> There you have it!  Six new ways to handle the &ldquo;I need to speak with someone&rdquo; objection.  Remember, some of these will work some of the time, but all of them will help you smoke out the real objection.  And once you get a handle on what&rsquo;s really likely to happen, then you can deal with it and overcome it &ndash; or move this prospect to the backburner and move on.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> First quarter U.S. GDP slipping to minus 0.7% as reported recently may look bad, but economists predicted worse: minus 0.9%. The &ldquo;advance estimate&rdquo; of any given quarter&rsquo;s GDP growth is released about a month after quarter-end, and is followed by additional estimates one month and two months later (last week&rsquo;s report was the second estimate of first quarter GDP growth).</p><p> Our conclusion is the same as when the reading was initially released: weak first quarter GDP growth is likely transitory. This time, the revision downward was driven by import growth likely caused by enhanced purchasing power via a stronger U.S. dollar. Goldman Sachs noted that the drag on GDP growth from higher imports was the most severe in thirty years. Even though the U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter, the Atlanta Fed claims the chances we slipped into recession are low: &ldquo;The latest data are more consistent with a temporarily weak quarter than evidence of more serious problems for the economy.&rdquo;</p><p> If GDP growth is consistently weak in the first quarter (as we wrote about here) despite &ldquo;seasonal adjustment,&rdquo; one might conclude something is wrong with the measure itself. Two weeks ago, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (the division responsible for GDP estimating) announced a &ldquo;multi-pronged&rdquo; plan to remove &ldquo;residual seasonality&rdquo; in its calculations beginning with the July 30, 2015 GDP growth estimate and applied retroactively all the way back to 2012. The San Francisco Fed speculated that with better seasonal adjustment techniques first quarter GDP growth might have been as high as 1.8%.</p><h3> So the trend of fishy first quarter GDP estimates may be coming to an end.</h3><p> <br/> Looking forward, estimates for second quarter GDP growth are more positive. The Atlanta Fed&rsquo;s GDPNow forecast, which, compared to Wall Street, accurately estimated first quarter GDP growth, stands at 0.8%, far below Goldman Sachs&rsquo; estimate of 2.4%. Fed Chair Janet Yellen only offers that the second half of 2015 will likely be better than the first. Our portfolio positioning reflects the view that even if GDP growth comes in strong (as it did at the end of 2014 when rates fell), economic growth alone cannot move interest rates higher. Inflation has been and, in our view, continues to be driving the bond market.</p>",

    "content": "<p> We recently had a chance to visit with HR Pro and Advisorpedia Contributor, Janine Truitt, to explore with her the current state of HR, starting her own burgeoning business and the joys of managing entrepreneurship and family. Enjoy!</p><p> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s talk about Human Resources &mdash; Did you find the profession or did it find you? </strong></p><p> It was a little of the both. I started off in college as a Biochemistry major. My first year of Calculus courses were the bane of evil and I suddenly had to rethink my major. I didn&rsquo;t want to be a business major and I wasn&rsquo;t going to go into Medicine or Law. Instead, I chose Psychology with a specialization in Clinical Psychology. At that time, I thought I would go into practice- until I got through my clinical practical and decided I enjoyed diagnosing patients; but could do without the therapy aspect. I had to find a new specialization and I was looking into Master&rsquo;s programs at this time also. I had the opportunity to speak with the Dean of Admissions at Adelphi University who asked me-if I knew much about Industrial Psychology. I said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and as she explained that it was a promising and lucrative field that would allow me to analyze work behaviors and motivations- I got excited. I ended up pursuing Industrial Psychology for the remainder of my time in college. I also went on to, minor in Community Health and Philosophy.</p><p> My senior year, I was fortunate to be hired as an HR intern at NYU Medical Center in New York City; which led to me getting my first HR related job as a Scientific/Clinical Recruiter for Aerotek Staffing. The rest is the culmination of me making strategic (and some not-so-strategic moves) to find an HR department that matched my enthusiasm for the profession and overall desire to improve the workforce.</p><p> <strong>  I&rsquo;ve been around a long time and have seen the changes at the corporate level &mdash; how do you think it has evolved? </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ve been around less time, but my experience has been that there are too many unnecessary levels of both complexity and people at the corporate level. In some organizations, this is necessary because of the sheer size of the organization. However, in many cases the layers of leaders are more like figureheads and very much out of touch with the needs and wants of their employees.</p><p> Equally, I am intrigued by the myriad of challenges and opportunities that the digital age presents. Transparency is now a business imperative-whether they like it or not. There have been enough PR blunders of late to suggest that there is a necessity for businesses and leaders to run their businesses with integrity.</p><p> <strong>  Has HR become too powerful there? Or do you see it more as an advocate for employees? Or do you think is there&rsquo;s a good balance? </strong></p><p> I have often wondered if it would be easier for HR if they we were charged with pleasing one party only- but alas this is not the case. HR has traditionally been betrothed to both the employees and leadership. How far HR tilts in either direction depends on the company and the standard operating procedures of the company.</p><p> HR has yet to become too powerful. I don&rsquo;t think you will hear any HR professional say they have too much respect or power- it is usually the opposite. Some of the wounds HR suffers from are self-inflicted and others are the result of misguided and toxic leadership that want to run their ship haphazardly. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think giving HR more power is the answer to the historical disconnect. I do think respect for the importance of the discipline and the great things that can be accomplished (when everyone is on the same page) are imperative.</p><p> <strong>  After spending a number of years in that world &mdash; what drove you to make a change and start your own business. </strong></p><p> Several things drove me to create Talent Think Innovations. I will start by saying that I had conjured the idea of having my own consulting firm someday about three years into my career. It was more of a long-term plan and something I hadn&rsquo;t spent any real time working on other than the swirling thoughts of it in my head.</p><p> In hindsight there were a few events/revelations that informed my transition: Over the course of my ten years in HR, I saw a lot of things that I knew I could do better; but would not be able to accomplish while employed in HR. My career became stagnant working in the national laboratory system after four years. Conversely, the reputation and platform I was building via my blog was starting to outshine my day job. The friends, colleagues, and mentors I had amassed via Social Media became my sounding board for the career issues I was facing. Each of them told me both separately and collectively to take the leap. The near-miss government shutdown of 2013 that would have affected federal contractors, left me feeling uneasy about having my livelihood be in the hands of others. Lastly, I got tired of begging, pleading and justifying my role as a mother and a professional. Frankly, I needed more flexibility.</p><p> <strong>  When thinking about such a big career move, how important is a good support system in making such a change? </strong></p><p> I am 100% sure that I would not have made this move if I didn&rsquo;t feel support from every angle of my life. I mentioned friends, colleagues and mentors were significant in helping me think through what I wanted to do and also believing in myself enough to know I could actually do it. This was huge for me.</p><p> The person that I really needed in my corner more than any of them was-my husband. Nothing I have done to date would have been possible without his support, pep talks and understanding. Being an entrepreneur isn&rsquo;t easy. Having someone to support and continuously push you is a necessary lifeline you need as you continue to create and build your company.</p><p> <strong>  How have you modeled Talent Think Innovations? </strong></p><p> Talent Think Innovations exists to make the workforce and business a more harmonious place to be for the humans that drive it. My tagline for the business is: &ldquo;Talent first. Think smart. Innovate always.&rdquo; I believe that every business can be successful and profitable if they put the needs of their talent first, make smart decisions and allow their workforces to be driven by innovation and creativity.</p><p> My services are designed to address Talent Management needs within the organization. That means I focus on creating strategy for Recruitment, Performance Management, Employee Relations, Succession Planning among other things.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not the gal you would call for the latest FMLA form, Benefits audits or Payroll. There are plenty of firms that enjoy the fruits of outsourced HR work. I have a laser-focus on working with companies that understand the importance of investing in their workforces through thoughtful strategy, initiatives and training.</p><p> In addition, I also focus on the resources aspect of the business by working with technology and HR Technology companies to improve how they service HR practitioners and other customer segments.</p><p> The foundation of Talent Think Innovations is HR, but I am seeing it evolve in many other directions. It is something I am watching and carefully taking note as I think about the long-term legacy and strategy of the company.</p><p> <strong>  What have been the challenges of being an entrepreneur and building a business? </strong></p><p> Building and running a business solo is time and labor-intensive. You are working when most people aren&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t work. I work early mornings, weekends, late nights, during the kids naps, sometimes briefly during homework and dinner. When you own your own business, it is all on you and so your family and friends may have to deal with a new reality of you not being able to do certain things because of what you are trying to accomplish.</p><p> Financially, being an entrepreneur is challenging-especially when you are funding yourself. You will inevitably have to make some sacrifices and even forfeit some of what was a given when you were employed in-house.</p><p> One of the other challenges is learning to lead with your purpose. Lots of people want to offer you tips, advice or even pontificate the virtues and pitfalls of entrepreneurship when they know you are a business owner. Many of them mean well, but the truth is you need to develop a filter. Filter in the helpful, discard the rest. Your business is your baby and while no one succeeds in creating a business in a vacuum- you have to continuously remain focused on your purpose and path.</p><p> <strong>  There&rsquo;s also the challenge of keeping yourself fresh. At a big company there are people always around to bounce ideas and thoughts off of. There&rsquo;s also the advantage of continually learning new things. How do you compensate for the lack of that? </strong></p><p> I was a loner even when I was in-house, but I agree there is still possibility for more interaction than not. I make an effort to get out to at least two to three events per month to develop business, learn and network. I am also involved in several associations and sit on a few boards that allow me to remain current in my field. I have also created my own co-worker ecosystem of other entrepreneurs, mentors and colleagues who I remain in constant contact with for inspiration, to vent or bounce ideas off of. I am very fortunate in this regard.</p><p> <strong>  What are the reasons companies seek out your services and how can someone best use your resources? </strong></p><p> A company would reach out to me when they have a small HR department that may not have the resources, bandwidth, or acumen to develop workforce strategy. They would also hire me when they have a full HR staff, but want to reenergize their current programs, initiatives and policies by applying my methods.</p><p> I am the person you hire if you have the following situations:</p><li> High turnover in various departments or the entire organization and want to do something about.</li><li> Employee Relations complaints are more frequent than you would like and your internal team has been unable to address it.</li><li> Hiring Managers complaining about not getting the service they need from the Recruitment team and you want both parties to work more cohesively.</li><li> You are interested in rolling out an Employee Advocacy program and need to assistance with identifying brand advocates within the organization and mobilizing them.</li><li> You&rsquo;re doing great in the people department-but you need someone to come in and talk to your current HR department about what the future holds for the workforce and how they can prepare.</li><li> You have a disjointed HR Technology strategy and need somebody to evaluate your current state and help you develop a technology strategy that can grow with you. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  What do you think is going to be the primary focus of CEOs and business owners in the next 10 years? </strong></p><p> Servant leadership. Robert K. Greenleaf first coined this term back in the 70&rsquo;s, but I believe this will be more important going forward than ever. It&rsquo;s the idea that leaders are servants first and leaders secondly. They serve the people (in my case) their workforce, customers and communities with a focus on their well-being. CEO&rsquo;s and business owners have traditionally been focused on the opposite which is power and an accumulation of wealth.</p><p> I believe this manner of leading has created many of the injustices and disparity we see now. I think people are no longer tolerating companies that lead in this manner. The consistent ousting of companies who are corrupt or have poor practices via social media is a good indication that there is a grassroots effort to change this.</p><p> Everyone wins with servant leadership. Your customers can patronize you knowing that the product or service you created was done with their best interest in mind. Employees come to work every day knowing that you are continuously building a business that will allow them to flourish. The communities want you in their neighborhood, because your ultimate goal is to put something good back into the places where they live and raise their families.</p><p> We all care about this kind of leadership, but Millennials and even Generation Z demand it- so it must change and it will.</p><p> <strong>  Talk to us about building and managing a business and being a mother to three small kids. </strong></p><p> This aspect of being an entrepreneur is the most rewarding. It takes a lot of planning and finesse to build and manage a business with three little ones. I don&rsquo;t have the luxury of picking up last minute and flying across the country to see a client with three kids. I have traveled to speaking gigs with my kids, I have had several shifts of babysitting planned to get to an event in my own town. The saying: &ldquo;it takes a village&hellip;&rdquo; should be tattooed to my head because it is what keeps my house and business running. My business right now functions around my kids schedules so I can run my business, but also be there for them .</p><p> It isn&rsquo;t an easy task, but I have somewhat conditioned them to understand what I do. I have also been very fortunate to have clients who are also parents that either telework or work from home. This sort of synergy has made the transition a lot easier.</p><p> I was far more stressed out when I had to figure out sick days or plan who would take off for certain holidays working for previous employers. I don&rsquo;t have those battles anymore. I will never have regret about whether or not I was there for my kids when they needed me the most. It may be more difficult juggling the two, but they are worth it to me.</p><p> <strong>  Is this the new and future model for women running their own business? </strong></p><p> Yes! I just read the other day that women-run businesses will provide more than half new small business jobs and a third of new jobs overall by 2018. We are creating businesses in the image of what we couldn&rsquo;t get from big business.</p><p> The U.S. is still one of the only first-world countries that doesn&rsquo;t have paid, federally mandated leave for maternity leave. Families are drowning in the debt of exorbitant childcare costs and costs incurred as a result of unpaid leave. Women are still being severely underpaid in contrast to our male counterparts doing similar work.</p><p> For these reasons alone, you will continue to see women create businesses to suit their lives and support their families. I am extremely supportive of women and even more so of mothers who want to take this leap into entrepreneurship.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not a viable option to just sit and suffer through the continued gender inequality. Instead, we are taking the suffrage and turning it into opportunity-so future generations of women don&rsquo;t have to be faced with the same hurdles.</p><p> <strong>  What would you like to leave us with? </strong></p><p> If you want to lead the Talent Think Innovations way, my call-to-action for businesses is the following:</p><li> Take the same care to hire the right people to lead your Human Resources Programs as you would the CFO. They can make or break your company.</li><li> Dedicate yourself to championing Diversity and Inclusion through action.</li><li> Invest in your employees.</li><li> Believe in your employees.</li><li> Inspire people through empowerment and innovation.</li><li> Lead with integrity.</li><li> Happy employees make for happy customers.</li><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> We make numerous decisions every day like what to wear, what to eat, and what form of advertising should our business pursue? </p><p> We even make a decision to defer a decision, or we decide to procrastinate. </p><p> We spend too little time on the how and the why of our decision-making, decisions that deeply affect the outcome of our business.</p><p> How do you make a decision?  Rely on gut instinct, your experience?  Or do you perform a thorough analysis of the decision?</p><h3> How important is this decision, and do we have all the information to make a wise choice?</h3><p> <br/> One of the major changes in decision-making occurred in the sports field.  In the movie, &ldquo;Billy Ball,&rdquo; we learned about the formula for creating the perfect baseball line-up based on cost-analysis, and statistics.  However, in many instances, coaches and managers still rely on gut and experience to make the final call.  </p><p> Let&rsquo;s consider the following as you approach the decisions you have to make for your business:</p><h3> Understand your business needs and the decision-making process</h3><p> <br/> Decision-making uses mathematical models, rules, experience, and instinctive actions. Mathematical models number-crunch data to determine the best solutions under a variety of circumstances.</p><li> Experience models most frequently use experience and historical trends to predict the future.</li><li> Instinctive models rely on expertise to evaluate alternatives.  <br/>  </li><p> Each of these has their pros and cons.  For example, bias, assumptions, and knowledge can greatly affect the value of these methods, so predicting hot weather in August is fairly easy, but can you predict the short term impact of climate change?  Not when there&rsquo;s so little to go on.    </p><h3> Beware and Minimize Bias</h3><p> <br/> The greatest detractor from effective decision-making, whether intentional, random, hidden or even unknown, is bias.</p><li> The first source of bias is our own set of beliefs, experience and reliance on the &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve always done it that way&rdquo; method.  Thus, we simply ignore information or facts that go against our beliefs.</li><li> The second is our information and perspective. For example, right brain and left brain people can see the same thing and yet understand it in a different way.</li><li> The third is incomplete or wrong information, or being too quick to make a judgment.  For example, take a frog.  When you say, &ldquo;jump,&rdquo; the frog jumps.  But tie his legs together and say, &ldquo;jump,&rdquo; the frog most likely won&rsquo;t jump.  To then decide that the frog has lost its hearing is the wrong answer.  <br/>  </li><h3> Decision-makers need to include risk and probability</h3><p> <br/> One of the crucial aspects of decisions is risk and the probability of the outcome.</p><li> Buying a lottery ticket has minimal risk because of the low cost, but comes with high potential value. In contrast, ignoring medical problems can have very high risk and very unfortunate consequences</li><li> Decisions and risk are also greatly affected by probability and information. There is a huge difference in predicting results where there is significant and consistent historical data. However, predicting results for new programs or with little or inconsistent data becomes much more difficult.</li><li> Decisions can also be greatly affected by things we don&rsquo;t consider or the environment.  Factors like the economy, gas prices, politics, social values, the internet, and cell phones can greatly affect our plans....  <br/>  </li><p> I recommend more consideration of the process of decision-making.  Ask yourself: how good is our information?  What are the consequences of mistakes?  And how much risk can we afford?   With the exception of issues like safety, I believe we can afford more risk.  We are overly concerned with the consequences of mistakes than the potential of risk. This approach is well stated by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook CEO, where she asks:  &ldquo;What would you do if you weren&rsquo;t afraid?&rdquo;       </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<h3> 1.   Be true to self and principles.  </h3><p> Never compromise on who you are or what your business stands for; walk away from questionable activity.  This speaks volumes for building your personal brand, relationships with people, and trust.  Sales are built upon trust.</p><h3> 2.  Fear of failure</h3><p> Failure doesn&rsquo;t exist as long as you are willing to learn from error.  Change vocabulary from failure to marketing research.  Entrepreneurship and Sales make for a continual learning journey.  The more one is open to learning, the more successful one will become.</p><h3> 3.  Anything IS Possible</h3><p> Many people will pronounce something is impossible.  However, by focusing on that something with determination, it will come about; perhaps not easily but with perseverance, the idea stands a chance for succeeding.</p><h3> 4.  Say Yes! to Opportunity when it scares you</h3><p> The better opportunities (in alignment with values) that frighten us, are usually the ones that will set us apart from the crowd.  Say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, and then get the help you need (invest in help if needed) to deliver on that commitment with perfection.</p><h3> 5.  At least yearly, invest in education.</h3><p> Paying for a coach or trainer is an investment that pays for itself in the end.  The hand holding and personal direction allows one to advance far more quickly.  This saves much wasted time and growth of business contributes to the bottom-line.</p><h3> 6.  Devote at least 10% of time to helping communities with your expertise</h3><p> The rewarding piece of business is that of helping others to succeed.  The bonus is to find yourself in a leadership position.  As new opportunities arise, the leaders are the ones to be contacted.</p><h3> 7.  Freely share content online</h3><p> Giving insights on how you approach business, free of charge, attracts those who are in need.  This obviously serves to build your clientele.</p><h3> 8.  Open Minded</h3><p> Consider all possibilities for growing business in order to select the few that are directly related to your vision and principles.  Likewise, respectfully do the same for your clientele.  Trust and sales will continue to grow.</p><h3> 9.  Collaborate</h3><p> The old sales model was to be secretive.  But, when we work together, for everyone to gain something, we enjoy a team victory.</p><h3> 10.  Six Month Meeting</h3><p> Every six months business owners should faithfully review successes along with strategies that didn&rsquo;t work out well.  Eliminate what did not work well, and leverage what did.  Next, reset your 12-month goal as this is the key for supercharging achievements.</p>",

    "link": "hire-for-people-skills-are-those-skills-taught-or-innate",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  We advocate hiring for attitude and training for skill, right?  </strong> <br/> <br/> Where do you think that attitude comes from? If attitude is defined as:  a manner of thinking, feeling, or behaving that reflects a state of mind or disposition  (according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/attitude\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Free Dictionary  </a> </u> ), I suppose we need to change the thinking to be: hire for people skills and train for technical skills... or hire for soft skills and train for hard skills. <br/> <br/> Where do people, or soft, skills come from? Who taught us to treat others with kindness and respect? Who taught us to be/think positive? Are those learned or innate? I'm split. I think some of it is in our DNA, while some of it is learned. How did your parents treat each other? Did you observe how they treated others? Somewhere in our young lives, we learned how to interact with others. <br/> <br/> Along comes a new book by  <u>  Kirt Manecke </u>  written specifically for teens, teaching them that good people skills are critical to getting a job and to having a successful career. I  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/10/go-extra-smile.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wrote  </a> </u>  about another of Kirt's books a couple years ago:  Smile: Sell More with Amazing Customer Service . That one is for the adult in us, but the one I'm writing about today -  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smileforteens.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smile &amp; Succeed for Teens  </a> </u>  - is for our kids. And for the kid in us. <br/> <br/> My 13 year old enjoyed it. If you have (or have had) teenagers, you know they have the attention span of a gnat. This book is written in a quick and easy format that can be read in order, out of order, over the course of months, or all at once. It's a quick read but an important one. <br/> <br/> Similar to his first book, in this book, Kirt outlines the Top 10 People Skills. He explains each one, outlines how to deliver that skill, and provides some examples and scenarios that help teens relate. The 10 Skills are... <br/> <br/> 1.  <strong>  Smile. </strong> A smile can create a friend or a customer. It's one of your most important people skills. When you first meet someone, greet them with a smile. <br/> 2.  <strong>  Make Good Eye Contact. </strong> Eye contact is a great way to make a positive first impression. It conveys respect, confidence, competence, honesty, and interest. <br/> 3.  <strong>  Turn Off the Electronics. </strong> If you're engrossed in your electronics, you're not focused on the people around you. Simple as that. <br/> 4.  <strong>  Say Please and Thank You. </strong> Needs no explanation! <br/> 5.  <strong>  Shake Hands Firmly. </strong> A firm handshake also creates a good first impression. We often form immediate and lasting opinions of the person with which we are shaking hands. <br/> 6.  <strong>  Introduce Yourself: Make a Friend. </strong> Don't be afraid to initiate a conversation with a person you'd like to get to know. <br/> 7.  <strong>  Pay Attention. </strong> Listen. Build trust and show you care. Make eye contact. Focus on what's being said. Engage in a conversation. <br/> 8.  <strong>  Be Enthusiastic. </strong> It's contagious. It shows that you're interested and passionate. Enthusiastic people are energizing and engaging. <br/> 9.  <strong>  Ask Questions. </strong> Asking questions makes for a good conversation. <br/> 10.  <strong>  Practice Proper Body Language. </strong> Body language says more than you think. Many of the other skills mentioned here fall under body language: smile, make good eye contact, pay attention, stand up straight. <br/> <br/> After explaining the 10 Skills, Kirt outlines ways that teens can use them to succeed in school, at work, and in life, and then goes on to explain other skills, including those that relate best to selling, delivering a great customer experience, volunteering, and being a rock star who changes the world! <br/> <br/> Honestly, I don't think it's too early to teach these skills and scenarios to our kids.  <br/> <br/> A smile is the curve that sets everything straight. -Phyllis Diller <br/>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  The compliance function in financial services businesses is fast changing to keep up with the growing number, complexity, and variety of regulations. </strong> The key point is that if the mindset to compliance changes from a simple &ldquo;tick the box&rdquo; assurance process to a business advisory approach, then a more robust business will be developed with the right foundations. Put another way, a compliance function structured the right way can add significant value to the business. There is an increasing risk that without a robust compliance function there is no business. To be successful, the compliance monitoring function must be highly automated. So, there needs to be substantial investment in the technology solutions that can help monitor transactions and retain documentation. If you want to learn more, review a paper issued by the Ethical Corporation  <a href=\"http://www.ethicalcorp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (  <u>   www.ethicalcorp.com  </u>  ) </a>  in January 2005 called: &ldquo;Capitalizing on the New Compliance Mindset.&rdquo; </p><p> What many forget is that the behavior of people drives transactions and business activity. Therefore, managing the behavior of people should be a much larger component of the compliance function rather than just a review of the paper flow. Again, such strategies can be built into the compliance systems. It is interesting that in the new era of compliance, that the more proactive firms are starting to hire behavioral finance specialists in their compliance departments. </p><p> They Holy Grail will be reached when the firms have systems for comparing the behavioral biases of a person (what they do) to what they should do. The starting point is collecting the right data about the client up-front in the client service process, including an objectively measured behavioral assessment. Without the right information being used as the foundation of a solution, it will never be suitable. Interestingly, if this upfront behavioral discovery process is handled properly, it will be very engaging for the client leading to higher revenues for the firm and reducing risk exposure of litigation. </p><p> So, a well-structured behavioral discovery process will enable both compliance and relationships to be at the core of building a client-centered business. Compliance can now come out of the shadows.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Dan Dyksen | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=tenetpartners&amp;original_referer=http://tenetpartners.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tenet Partners  </u> </a></p><p> What can I possibly add to the chorus of people (designers and non-designers alike) currently discussing the 2016 presidential candidate logos?</p><p> I&rsquo;ll start by saying how much I love that so many people are talking about logos. On the subway yesterday, I overheard a grandmother say, &ldquo;I would have gone with a serif for my logo, it&rsquo;s just so much more friendly.&rdquo; It made me smile that she actually knew the difference between serif and sans serif and could express the associated personalities of each. And, I appreciate that so many people are talking about the purpose of a logo and what it communicates. With that said, I find it unfortunate that the dialogue is often so mean spirited. It seems that logo bashing has become a sport these days and political logos just intensify online snarkiness &mdash; which I will do my best to avoid.</p><br /><p> In the context of this particular competitive set, I believe that Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s &ldquo;H&rdquo; is the most successful logo. Is it as inspirational and graceful as President Obama&rsquo;s iconic &ldquo;O&rdquo;? No, but it does an impressive job of doing what a logo is meant to do. It clearly connotes an idea ( Progression! Moving forward! ) and is memorable in its bold simplicity. In addition, the absence of a waving flag or military star is unexpected. Designed by Michael Bierut at Pentagram, this logo clearly stands out in the crowded, boisterous world of politics. In my opinion, it will stand the test of time.</p><p> The other three logos are what you&rsquo;d expect both visually and conceptually, with varying degrees of success.</p><p> I certainly give Rand Paul credit for the subtle &ldquo;torch&rdquo; in his logo and the lack of the usual red, white and blue. And, I appreciate the bold decision to go with &ldquo;RAND&rdquo; to convey that he&rsquo;s approachable and just one of the guys. I personally would have avoided the heavy italic font that looks too much like a moving company&rsquo;s logo from the 1970s.</p><p> Marco Rubio&rsquo;s logo has some nice features and some real problems. The all-lowercase type is both modern and friendly, but the small American map dotting the &ldquo;i&rdquo; is really unfortunate. Not only does it look amateurish, but it also doesn&rsquo;t translate at all in smaller applications. And, what about Hawaii and Alaska? I&rsquo;m pretty sure they still get to vote, right?</p><p> That brings us to Ted Cruz and what appears to be an American flag on fire. The symbolism of this icon left me scratching my head. The most conservative of the group, I do think it was the right decision to go with a classic serif and an all-American color palette. Both of these elements clearly reinforce traditional values.Z</p><p> With the 2016 presidential campaign just getting started, I&rsquo;m excited to see even more logos join the race. Who knows? Maybe the best is yet to come.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you own a cell phone, iPad, computer or a laptop and have a hard time falling asleep, <strong>  your technology might be to blame for your tossing and turning. </strong></p><p> Within our eyes there are cells known as rods and cones, which are necessary for normal vision. Our eyes also contain retinal ganglion cells that store melanopsin. Melanopsin is particularly sensitive to blue light, a band of light in the narrow 400-480nm range. When blue light hits the retina a signal is sent to the hypothalamus and melatonin production is turned off and delayed by several hours. This results in an inability to fall asleep and causes difficulty when waking up, as melatonin levels are inappropriately elevated in the morning.</p><p> Blue light is everywhere and can be found within the displays of iPads, computers, laptops, cell phones. New government mandated CFL (compact florescent lighting) and LED (Light emitting diode) bulbs, which give out much more blue light than the previous versions, can also create an excess of blue light. With this increase in blue light exposure it&rsquo;s no wonder we are seeing an epidemic of sleep deprivation.</p><p> <strong>  A lack of sleep can manifest itself in many way such as; increased stress, cognitive dysfunction, chronic diseases mood disorders and obesity. </strong> In fact, in a recent study, hamsters exposed to blue light at night developed cellular changes in an area of the brain called the hippocampus. This part of the brain is very much involved in memory and emotional processing.</p><p> So, short of going back to pre-industrial revolution conditions, what can we do to decrease our exposure to blue light and get our circadian sleep wake cycle back to normal? You can turn off your laptop, iPad, and other electronics gadgets, including that your LED TV, at least two hours before bedtime. You can also use red night lights in your bedroom for illumination; since red light has the lowest effect on melatonin production of all light wavelengths.</p><p> Another idea, which I have instituted successfully, in many of my patients is to where blue blocker sunglasses at night. These are very effective in screening out blue light. Finally, there is available a computer program that alters the color of your computer display according to the time of day it is called F.Lux and can be found online.</p><p> The bottom line is that we are being bombarded with blue light. More than 200 million computers are purchased worldwide per year. We need to be aware of what I would call blue light pollution. By taking measures to prevent over exposure at the wrong time of day we can do much to improve our health.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve often thought about the many parallels in the world of psychology/psychotherapy to PR.</p><p> PR is about analysing, addressing negatives, focussing on positives and monitoring the ongoing health and state of a business. It&rsquo;s about &lsquo;laying it bare&rsquo; and being brutally honest about all aspects of your business to move on in a positive, constructive and productive way.</p><p> It&rsquo;s about <strong>  being constantly </strong> <strong>  aware of areas of weakness and amplifying your strengths. </strong> It&rsquo;s about reaching out to people that can help you. It&rsquo;s about looking at your business from all different perspectives. You may see a psychotherapist if you &lsquo;can&rsquo;t see the wood for the trees&rsquo; I think often when you&rsquo;re so emerged in a business, it&rsquo;s just the same. It&rsquo;s hard to see things objectively or from other peoples perspective.</p><p> PR helps you see these perspectives. It helps you see your business from all angles, therefore highlighting areas that you had perhaps overseen or were unaware of.</p><p> <strong>  A good PR consultant will give you an honest view on your business. </strong> They will show you how to view your business in 3D, seeing the business as a model. Pick it up, turn it over, see it from your clients POV.</p><p> <strong>  If you see a therapist you are open and willing to change. </strong> You are reaching out to them for ways to improve, to see a different view on things, to see a way forward. However by not accepting certain facets of yourself change will be very hard. This is the same in PR, <strong>  you have to be willing to accept constructive criticism and you have to be willing and open to change. </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://bigvoicemanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/beautiful-quotes-on-change.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://bigvoicemanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/beautiful-quotes-on-change-264x300.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Don&rsquo;t be afraid of change. Change is inevitable. If you&rsquo;re company is stagnant or isn&rsquo;t moving forwards then there&rsquo;s clearly a blockage somewhere. This needs clearing, just like seeing a therapist for a personal concern or blockage. The therapist will talk with you and together you will be able to pinpoint the area that needs addressing. It&rsquo;s the same with PR. In PR it&rsquo;s just as important to really understand the company. I have written a lot about the importance of P&gt;P (Person to Person) in marketing, PR and in business in general. Whatever the brand or the product, unless we have started interplanetary commerce before this blog is published, the likelihood it that you&rsquo;re dealing with another human being. We all have the same fundamental needs, we are all roughly made up in the same biological way, we all have emotional and physical needs and an ego. Every company started with an idea, a passion, a dream, and whether its a start up or a century old company the chances are it takes up a large part of your time and time is one of our most precious commodities. So the importance of making a success of your company is deeply important, not to mention the financial implications.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> &ldquo;Strength lies in differences, not similarities.&rdquo; &mdash;Stephen Covey</p><h3> Diversity</h3><p> <br/> How do you come up with new ideas and solutions to problems? How do you make sure your thinking is representative of the real world? You bring diversity to the table, that&rsquo;s how. There is so much value in bringing people with diverse experience, backgrounds, and perspectives to any situation. If you want to optimize your problem-solving; ability to challenge the status quo; adaptability; and perception of inclusion, build respect for diversity into your core values.</p><h3> Problem-solving</h3><p> <br/> Don Tapscott said, &ldquo;Learning to collaborate is part of equipping yourself for effectiveness, problem-solving, innovation, and life-long learning in and ever-changing, networked economy.&rdquo; When you learn to collaborate with others who DO NOT share your same perspective, you dramatically increase the odds of finding innovative solutions to problems. Diversity promotes creativity and opens the door to a world of new questions. It encourages healthy debate which leads to better decisions. It provides a new point-of-view from which to examine and tackle problems.</p><h3> Status quo</h3><p> <br/> Ronald Reagan quipped, &ldquo;Status quo, you know, is Latin for &lsquo;the mess we&rsquo;re in&rsquo;.&rdquo; Diversity supports disruptive ideas and, disruptive ideas can be good. Some of the best ideas come when you disrupt the status quo. When you continually turn to those who share your same background and experiences, you get the same perspective and thus, the same results. Continually turning to the same perspective just reinforces the status quo. Diversity challenges and pushes back against this stagnation. If you want the best future, it needs to look different from the past. This requires embracing diversity, considering new points-of-view, and challenging the status quo.</p><h3> Adaptability</h3><p> <br/> According Marc Andreessen, &ldquo;Adaptability is key.&rdquo; Having diversity at the table is a significant factor in your organization&rsquo;s ability to innovate and adapt to today&rsquo;s fast changing operating environment. Adaptability has always been, and always will be essential to continued growth and prosperity. Diversity breeds innovation and adaptability which breed success. It brings with it a deeper level of understanding, experience, competencies, philosophies, and perspectives. Chances are that your customers are diverse and becoming more diverse every day. Bringing diversity to the table helps ensure that your thinking reflects the real world so you will be able to adapt as necessary and thrive.</p><h3> Inclusion</h3><p> <br/> Gary Hamel explained, &ldquo;Today, no leader can afford to be indifferent to the challenge of engaging employees in the work of creating the future. Engagement may have been optional in the past, but it&rsquo;s pretty much the whole game today.&rdquo; Your workforce is diverse, and every employee needs a sense of inclusion. You need to ensure that the people who are going to be affected by decisions and will have the responsibility for implementation have a voice. If you are not intentionally including diversity, you are unintentionally excluding it. Inclusion removes perceived barriers and empowers employees. It increases buy-in and builds relationships. These relationships are the vehicle with which you get anything done as a leader.</p><h3> Reap the Benefits</h3><p> <br/> Albert Einstein believed, &ldquo;We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.&rdquo; As great of an asset as your experience, knowledge, and background may be, these assets cause you to have biases, blinders, and a focus from one perspective. Bringing diversity to the table improves problem-solving, challenging of the status quo, adaptability, and inclusion. Learn to embrace diversity and you will reap the benefits.</p><p> <strong>  How can you start bringing diversity to the table today? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Can the words we use predict our success in our business? </strong> This is a growing area of research &ndash; where the data analyzed is the words that we use. This language analysis has been done to predict the success of athletes, movies, books and more. Can they predict your success as a financial advisor too?</p><p> Researchers at Stony Brook University have developed an algorithm that will indicate whether a book will be commercially successful with 84% accuracy. It was found that successful books made frequent use of conjunctions, prepositions, nouns, pronouns, determiners and adjectives. Less successful books had a higher percentage of verbs, adverbs, and foreign words and also relied heavily on clich&eacute;s, extreme and negative words.  <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Blog/2014/01/09/Scientists-devise-algorithm-to-predict-success-of-novels/2021389295431/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Read more here  </u>  .  </a></p><p> In a study by Jason Warnick, PhD, a behavioral neuroscientist at Arkansas Tech University in Russelville, evidence shows that outcomes of boxing matches can be predicted based on the boxer&rsquo;s use of language immediately before the bout.</p><p> The study was based on interviews, press conference quotes, and press release statements given by professional boxers before boxing matches during a 21-month time span. The study revealed that several patterns were associated with winning a bout: words conveying positive emotions, words focusing on health, and words focusing on work.</p><p> In the movie business, Vinny Bruzzese has started a service he calls script evaluation. For a hefty fee, Bruzzese and his team of analysts compare the story structure and genre of a draft script with those of released movies, looking for clues to box-office success. The researchers are basically analyzing the words in the script.  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/business/media/solving-equation-of-a-hit-film-script-with-data.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Read more here  </u>  . </a></p><p> So, when we are communicating with a prospect or strategic alliance, our words are critical. Without realizing it, the words we say could be having a serious impact on our success. As of yet there hasn&rsquo;t been a statistical analysis (that I am aware of) looking at the words that successful financial advisors use, but there has been a lot of speculation and observation about what works. If you want more &ndash; check out the article in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2011/12/26/the-power-of-words?page_all=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research Magazine  </a> </u>  called &ldquo;The Power of Words.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The key takeaway: </strong>  We all need to choose our words carefully &ndash; or perhaps more carefully &ndash; with great awareness on what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Your words matter, and they can make all the difference!</p>",

Ewald&rsquo;s initial elation at being called &ldquo;a star&rdquo; by ministry officials was soon diminished when <strong>  she learned that she was being paid $30,000 less than a male colleague. </strong> And, despite attempts to resolve the situation she was ignored and &ldquo;hurt,&rdquo; she said.</p><p> <strong>  Ewald was hired by the consulate with a salary of $70,000 and later discovered that a younger male employee, with less experience and without her 20 years of residency in Norway and fluency with the language, was not only hired at $30,000 more--$100,000 annually&mdash;but was receiving health care benefits, which she was not. </strong></p><p> Fair? It certainly doesn&rsquo;t seem so and, although her initial inquiries were virtually ignored, today Ewald is vindicated, and <strong>  the government of Norway is embarrassed. </strong> Ewald won her case last year in a U.S. federal court in Minnesota (Note:  <u>  my sister </u> , Sheila Engelmeier, was one of her attorneys!)&mdash;a result that has, to date, cost an estimated NOK 35 million, which includes the Norwegian government&rsquo;s legal bills.</p><p> Not only did the country ignore Ewald&rsquo;s initial inquiries about the discrepancy in pay, but they also turned down an option for settlement which, according to Sheila, would had amounted to less than 10 percent of what they ended up paying.</p><p> Ouch! This from a country that is widely touted as being very supportive of pay equity.</p><p> Anne Kristin Lund, who leads the Norwegian ministry&rsquo;s department for competence and resources, was quoted in Norwegian paper Daegens N&aelig;ringsliv (DN) as saying: &ldquo;this case is a reminder of how important it is to operate correctly in relation to labour law.&rdquo;</p><p> We agree.</p><p> We also know, of course, that this type of pay inequity is not limited to other countries. We have the same issues right here in the United States. And we should be equally as embarrassed as this small country is.</p><p> What&rsquo;s the situation in your organization?

The Nike+ running sensor is the best known product and was designed with Apple. <strong>  Now 5 million runners log on to check out their workout statistics. </strong> There is also another product a wristband that tracks energy output called a the Fuel Band.</p><p> Some people understand the implications of giving away their data and realise clever marketers will utilise that to sell them products and services just as they need them or begin looking for them. This for most people will become an awful intrusion of their privacy over the next few years we will see lots of programs and apps launched to stop the flow of personal data.</p><p> <strong>  What Nike are doing is very clever they are taking age old marketing techniques and becoming the trusted adviser to their customers or sports clients as they should be called. </strong></p><p> <strong>  They are building communities and strengthening relationships to such a point that people will not only buy one pair of shoes and a wearable device but if managed correctly, if the marketing is not too aggressive, they will create that feel good factor that a brand is looking to give their customers for life! </strong></p><p> Enabling their revenues to grow even further and it will lower their marketing costs dramatically. We all know that it&rsquo;s considerably more expensive to obtain a new customer through marketing, rather than nurture our existing clients!</p><p> MarketingWeek reports that Nike has moved its social media management in house, like a lot of larger businesses they have realised that to effectively communicate and build customer advocacy they can do it much better than an external agency that isn&rsquo;t on the front line.</p><p> However a symbiotic Brand-Agency relationship can still be successful, but it can only exist if there is a knowledge base or tool base that the agency can provide in a more cost effective manner or in a better way than the brand. Ie. providing data analysis or certain tech products that the brand doesn&rsquo;t have. Or bringing expertise on board from people who are at the cutting edge of new developments and technologies within the marketing industry.</p><p> The reason a good agency / brand relationship still needs to exist is that tools are being built every day and new platforms and products are being launched which will potentially disrupt the brands themselves; hence why its crucial for them to be connected to expertise that can not only monitor those disruptions but can assist them to be the disruption themselves with their creative ideas and technological solutions.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to work out that over the next few years Nike and others will take on sports niches one by one providing devices that integrate into the daily lives of the people and their sport activities, without hindering sports performance. Hold on to your hats people the ride into IoT is going to be lots of fun!</p>",

In their approach, co-founders Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt are betting on a best case scenario where the service will reach a critical mass of customers and daily trade volume that allow it to operate and profit through payments for order flow and account balance interest accumulation. If the best case scenario isn't attainable? Then there is competitive margin ( <u>  in beta </u> ) and options trading (still in planning). Some believe it is the brokerage firm that will finally bring millennials into the stock market with its free and mobile-only attributes, but the truth is that their business model isn&rsquo;t an entirely new idea; their ultimate path to profitability may not put young investors&rsquo; best interests first.</p><p> The $0 commission business model is yet to rock the self-service brokerage industry or show any glimpse of sustainable practice. Also, no brokerage house or institution has been able to effectively &ldquo;capture&rdquo; the millennial market (although many are trying). After raising $25 million and taking a shot at commission-free trading, Zecco merged with TradeKing after slowly imposing fees and higher minimum balances on its &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; lured client base. For RobinHood, dodging the industry average 15% of revenue made from commission fees means compensating with an optimal amount of trade volume and/or interest collection. Since this approach has been unsuccessful in the past, it is certainly concerning to see a millennial-targeted trading platform with a revenue plan B based largely on leverage.</p><p> With  <u>  <a href=\"http://collegedebt.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   college tuition debt  </a> </u>  soaring and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2015/06/05/millennial-college-graduates-young-educated-jobless-335821.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   post-graduation unemployment  </a> </u>  a very real danger, is it ethical to be targeting 21-34 year-olds for margin trading? One cannot help but imagine how many will rationalize diversion of &ldquo;would be&rdquo; commission fees into margin position interest. In fact, the prospect of free trading in RobinHood&rsquo;s case might dilute the intricacy of risk in margin trading by way of the coupon mentality. With $0 trades, margin appears to be more like an upsell. After all, only 24% of young adults born between 1978 and 1994 could answer four or five questions correctly on a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/14_0100%201_IEF_Research%20Report_CEA_3%206%2014%20%28FINAL%29_0_0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   basic financial literacy quiz  </a> </u> . In spite of that, the recent CI syndicated study &ldquo; <u>  The Millennial Shift </u> &rdquo; found that although millennials themselves are concerned about financial literacy, 84% contradictively chose not to utilize financial education tools offered on institutional brokerage sites regarding retirement investing.</p><p> Thus far, the marketing seems to be working. According to the company&rsquo;s correspondence with  <u>  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/12/investing/robinhood-app-free-trading-millennials/\" target=\"_blank\">   CNN Money  </a> </u> , a notably lengthy wait list of 800,000 people grew before RobinHood&rsquo;s successful public launch. The millennial reception is apparent. The average age of RobinHood users is 26, and 25% of customers are first-time investors. The co-founders frequently use the term &ldquo;younger people&rdquo; when discussing the user base, while repeatedly reminding the audience that they are not in it for the money.</p><p> Another company that has been particularly effective in targeting millennials and maintaining a $0 commission structure without public mention of margin trading is ACORNS. ACORNS allows users to round card payments to the nearest whole dollar and allocate that change towards a smart portfolio of their choosing. Account holders  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.acorns.com/support/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pay  </a> </u>  $1 per month for account balances under $5,000 or 0.25% per year against amounts over $5,000. Their user base was 35% 18 to 32 years old in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/acorns-investing-app-2014-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   October 2014  </a> </u>  and as of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.startupdaily.net/2015/05/will-fintech-startup-acorns-motivate-gen-y-australians-invest-loose-change-stock-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   May 2015  </a> </u>  has attracted 750,000 people.</p><p> In Merrill Edge&rsquo;s study &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.merrilledge.com/report/visualization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How Millennials Budget, Spend and Save Their Money  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; 73% defined financial success as having no debt, while 73% said it meant living comfortably today; 70% said it was having enough for the retirement they want. This age group has real concerns and needs that could charm them into margin trading at the presence of reduced commission fees or service payments. Irrationality is at the center of behavioral finance. Cognitive dissonance between the need to save or pay bills and the prospect of margin trading amplifying market gains could very well combine into a new form of crisis, one in millennial margin debt loading. How could this millennial debt loading affect trading and saving behavior in the future? More importantly, how will it affect trust in the financial services industry over the next century?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Marketing has always been a challenge for me, although I am learning so many ways to overcome my fears. Sometimes when we get an obstacle stuck in our heads, it can take extra focus to jump over it. So what I have tried to do is not look at marketing as an overwhelming activity, but rather as a way to share and connect with others. In fact, I now realize that when I talk to people informally or have discussions with my clients about leadership, I am actually marketing.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Leaders+are+not+fearful+of+soft+marketing+and+self-promotion.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/05/11/four-ways-to-lead-with-customers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leaders are not fearful of soft marketing and self-promotion.  </a> </u></p><p> Many of us know that our greatest lessons learned happen in non-traditional places. I was having a hair process (you guess which one) done this week, and got involved in a deep conversation with the operator. I have known her for years and we always exchange personal stories but this time we started to talk about the needs of her customers. I became fascinated, because I am after all, one of her loyal customers. As she told me about all the ways she kept up in the industry, including conferences and training, it became apparent there was a culture of learning in this shop. Every person who works there, including the owner, values attending courses and gaining knowledge about the newest techniques and products.</p><p> She went on to tell me about the type of customers she had, from their personalities to their hair types. She told them that the clientele expected the operators to keep up with the trends. I couldn&rsquo;t believe how much thought went into her understanding of her clients. But she nailed it! She knew who we were and what we wanted to remain loyal customers.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=We+are+leading+when+we+know+the+needs+and+backgrounds+of+our+customers.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/05/11/four-ways-to-lead-with-customers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   We are leading when we know the needs and backgrounds of our customers.  </a> </u></p><h3> <strong>  Here are four tips that may help you lead your marketing efforts: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. Dump the Hard Sell for Sharing </h3><p> <br/> What I have learned to be true is that I am not a door-to-door salesperson. I am not comfortable cold calling or even being pushy at network events. The best way for me to share myself is through helping others. Listening to people&rsquo;s challenges at work and coming up with ways to  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2014/07/07/are-you-an-empowered-leader/#sthash.2x6zo7Uj.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  empower </a>  them to lead, can be a very effective marketing strategy.</p><h3> 2. Know Who Your Customers Are</h3><p> <br/> It is critical to have a clear understanding of who your customer is and what they are all about.</p><li> Learn what they value</li><li> Research their workplace cultures</li><li> Are they located in big cities or smaller communities?</li><li> Do they work in larger or smaller organizations?</li><li> Do they work from home?</li><li> What networks do your customers typically connect with?</li><li> Are they predominantly in certain industries?</li><li> Get a feel for who they are not <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Know What Your Customers Want</h3><p> <br/> Once you know the demographics of your customer, focus in on their  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2010/07/22/leading-with-the-customer-in-mind/#sthash.gfv6SWbr.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   particular needs  </u>  . </a>  Ask yourself and them what challenges they are facing and if you have the best background to help them. Sometimes I will speak to a potential client and either realize I can work easily with them or we are like oil and water. But recognizing that early on can prove invaluable.  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2014/05/05/are-you-really-listening-if-not-youre-not-leading/#sthash.sh74SALK.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Strategically listen  </a> </u>  to their concerns and don&rsquo;t just sell your services or products.</p><h3> 4. Delight Customers Through Storytelling</h3><p> <br/> The best way to connect with people is through  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2012/01/31/the-power-of-storytelling/#sthash.EhDRo4zW.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   stories  </a> </u>  that demonstrate how you have helped others in the same way or with similar challenges. Just rattling off referral names, which are definitely important, isn&rsquo;t always the best approach. Our potential clients need to hear about how we work with others, our style and how we share our ideas.</p><li> Set up a face to face conversation in a Google hangout or Skype</li><li> Offer a free first consult</li><li> Never brag or be too full of yourself</li><li> Remind them that other people and organizations are experiencing similar challenges <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How do you lead with customers? What are some of your best marketing strategies? </strong></p>",

    "link": "dont-bomb-your-photos-consider-these-5-points-before-you-shoot",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Photos ain&rsquo;t what they used to be. They&rsquo;re SO much more. Whether it&rsquo;s a professional online profile or a simple selfie, we&rsquo;re inundated with images non-stop.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why, whether you&rsquo;re looking to create your online brand for the first time or revamping a pre-existing campaign, professional images are a MUST. But with online media, there is so much more to think about.</p><p> Twenty years ago, you had a headshot taken and you were done. Nowadays, with websites and social media, it&rsquo;s a whole different ballgame.</p><p> Consider these 5 points BEFORE you schedule your shoot:</p><p> <strong>  1. Variety: </strong>  Since photos are used in so many different ways, you need different angles to choose from. Be sure to take shots in both portrait and landscape orientation. Take close up headshots and full body as well.</p><p> That way, when incorporating images into your website, you don&rsquo;t have to squeeze a horizontal image where a vertical image would really fit best. Also, once you start creating a buzz, different media outlets will be asking for images as well and they&rsquo;ll be specific regarding what type of photos they need. And you&rsquo;ll be ready!</p><p> <strong>  2. Don&rsquo;t Hog The Spotlight:  </strong> If you&rsquo;re having your team/band/group photographed, it&rsquo;s a great idea to have individual shots of each member taken as well as a group photo. Even if you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary.</p><p> Consider a &ldquo;staff&rdquo; type page on your website. It&rsquo;s great to have a photo next to each short bio of team members. Change things up and include individual shots along with group photos throughout the site, too.</p><p> <strong>  3. Be Negative:  </strong> Take plenty of images that include negative space around you. That&rsquo;s a great place to include a company logo or other text about your company/service.</p><p> It offers much more flexibility. Use a photo as the background on your website, for example, without worrying about covering up someone&rsquo;s face!</p><p> <strong>  4. Size Does Matter: </strong>  Consider how people view online images. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SmartInsights  </a> </u> , 80% of people use their smartphones to search the Internet. Which means one thing.</p><p> Photos need to look good tiny! But how can you tell which ones will look best? Make sure you view proofs on different devices and as thumbnails to really get the best idea.</p><p> <strong>  5. Plan With A Purpose: </strong>  Make a list of how images will be used, for both print and online. Here is a great place to start:</p><p> -Facebook: profile pic and cover photo <br/> -Twitter: avatar <br/> -Website: masthead, &ldquo;about me&rdquo; page, &ldquo;contact me&rdquo; page, or home page background <br/> -Various online avatars <br/> -Email signature photo <br/> -Advertisements <br/> -Product packaging <br/> -Book covers <br/> -Business cards <br/> -Print media</p><p> Talk all of these options over with the photographer and make sure you come up with a concrete plan. That way, when your proofs come back, you&rsquo;ll have all the bases covered!</p>",

    "link": "six-crucial-tips-for-presenting-with-confidence",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Financial advisors present every day. Whether to a client, prospect or board having the skills to communicate effectively is so important. Every communication tells your audience who you are and sells your ideas to them. Here are six keys to giving confident and clear presentations:</p><h3> Establish the &lsquo;Why&rsquo;</h3><p> <br/> What&rsquo;s the expected outcome of your presentation? What point do you want to deliver to your audience? Why is it happening at a certain point in time? These are a few questions that you need to address before you present anything &ndash; including a portfolio update or any recent development in the market to your clients.</p><p> Remember, your aim will be different &ndash; it could be to educate, motivate, inspire, convince, or sell to your audience. Analyze the desired outcome for every presentation based on what you hope to accomplish, and then structure it accordingly.</p><h3> Know &lsquo;Who&rsquo;</h3><p> <br/> What do you know about the audience and how much do they know about your presentation topic? This approach is the \"Know Your Audience\" approach to delivering a solid presentation, which will help you determine important areas of information and how you should present them to your audience.</p><p> Depending on the audience&rsquo;s level of understanding, a financial advisor should modify material to meet their needs. Equally important is the communication approach. Will you choose the conventional paper-based approach or present using an iPad or PowerPoint?</p><h3> Create Flow</h3><p> <br/> In order to make the context understandable to your clients, create a logical flow for your presentation. Don&rsquo;t inundate them with piles of information. Make an outline. Divide the information into several categories by answering the following &lsquo;W&rsquo; questions:</p><p> (a) What&rsquo;s the general subject?</p><p> (b) What categories of information can be made?</p><p> (c) What are the three-most important pieces of information within each segment?</p><h3> Provide Context</h3><p> <br/> Keep asking yourself &ldquo;why&rdquo; when working on the presentation material. Why is the financial presentation significant to my audience? Why do they need it? Your audience does not always know what your information means. Make it simple for them. Develop a clear link between the financial information and its importance for the listener. It is better to exclude any information that you can&rsquo;t give context to.</p><h3> Behavior Mapping</h3><p> <br/> Practice modifying your approach in response to the audience&rsquo;s reaction is an excellent way to connect with them. This technique is referred to as &ldquo;mapping&rdquo; or \"mirroring\". For instance, slow down if you&rsquo;re a fast talker and your client is a slow, thinking type. However, you don&rsquo;t want to make this too obvious, otherwise, you will only annoy your audience members.</p><h3> Closure</h3><p> <br/> At the end of a presentation, review important bits of information. Moreover, leave your audience with important takeaways. Let them know if you want something from them. If you want them to make a pivotal sales decision, indicate it clearly.</p><p> No matter what the motive of your presentation is, these six tips can be modified to meet your specific needs.

    "content": "<p> Written by: Nigel Reid | <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Econnexx  </u> </a></p><p> People can now choose and manage their own investments through fund supermarkets; compare and select insurance policies and a host of other financial products at the click of a button. </p><p> They are more empowered than ever before and in-turn becoming less reliant on others to help them get what they want.</p><h3> What This Means For Financial Advisers </h3><p> <br/> Although technology has empowered consumers with more choice and control, this comes with an element of risk. Without guidance from a financial adviser they may find self-planning proves to be harmful to achieving the desired end results. </p><p> The problem faced by financial advisers is that consumers will continue to be influenced by technology such as social media and online sites with easy to purchase products. Technology has removed the need for many to meet face to face with the majority of service providers, including financial advisers. Instead they choose to use channels such as the Internet and social media to source general information and email or livechat to communicate one on one.</p><p> Financial advisers must therefore adopt a new approach in order to remain relevant and secure the custom of a new breed of clientele.</p><h3> The New Role For Financial Advisers</h3><p> <br/> Although technology has eroded some of the reasons for people to seek the help of a financial adviser, it has also created new opportunities for advisers to reach more people.</p><p> Many firms have embraced technology to a degree but have failed to see any significant rewards &ndash; such as,  </p><li> Their website may bring in visitors but only a very small proportion of these visitors actually make contact and become clients.</li><li> They use social media but see little engagement or interaction from people and see little business value from allocating their time to social channels. <br/>  </li><p> For financial advisers to get the most from their online profile, social media and technology as a whole they need to focus on: </p><li> Having a defined ideal client type with their online profile and message created to appeal to these personas.</li><li> Focus on providing value in exchange for basic contact information. Such as downloadable guides, webinars, videos, free online consultations. Use social media to share and promote.</li><li> Develop a remarketing process to continually engage with contacts generated through your offerings, reminding them of your firm and the benefits you have to offer them. <br/>  </li><p> By implementing these 3 steps you will have a firm that appeals to the right audience, the ability to convert your audience into contacts, and effective processes to convert those contacts into clients. </p><h3> Building New Relationships</h3><p> <br/> The success of financial advisers in the past was embedded within their ability to create a one on one relationship with a client. These relationships built trust and security amongst adviser and client, which converted into long lasting business relationships.</p><p> As technology has diluted the need for face to face engagement it has created a void that has been difficult to fill.</p><p> However automated marketing provides advisers with a new way to reach more people and build personal relationships with prospects and clients.</p><h3> How Automated Marketing Builds Relationships</h3><p> <br/> Automated marketing takes the information collected when visitors come to your site (such as the pages they viewed) and when they complete a form to download an offering - and uses this information to personalise future correspondence.</p><p> By creating a series of emails each designed to address obstacles and concerns faced by your target clients you are able to reconnect with prospects on a personal level, whilst moving them closer to making contact. When they do make contact a relationship has already been formed. </p><p> Technology will not go away, nor will it stop advancing, yet a significant proportion of financial advisers remain routed to their own traditional ways of working. Those who don&rsquo;t take heed and adapt to technology will only find it more and more difficult to achieve the success they strive for &ndash; or regain the success they may have enjoyed in the past. </p><p> The possibilities for financial advisers through the use of technology are endless and the opportunities are real.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In the past, having a job meant having a career. But things have changed so drastically, and now, moving from one job to another is considered as an essential step towards a successful career path. Also, it is very common for people to jump from one career to another.</p><p> If you lack the confidence to change careers at this point in your life, you are not alone. There are, in fact, plenty of reasons you want to just stay put. If you&rsquo;re happy with your present career, there&rsquo;s no reason to change. But if your job and career don&rsquo;t give you satisfaction anymore, you definitely have to make a move now.</p><h3> Here are the lies you need to stop telling yourself about your career:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay for just one more year.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;ve said this more than 5 times already, and you&rsquo;re just making yourself believe that a year is enough for you to make the decision. Stop putting off the inevitable! You know if you have the right career or not, so if you can&rsquo;t find satisfaction in your present career, you have to make the change now.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;This is what I went to college for.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to force yourself to love a meaningless career just because it&rsquo;s what you wanted back in college. People change and circumstances change. Examine yourself to know your passion because your degree should not dictate what you ought to become&hellip;it&rsquo;s your passion.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any other jobs out there for me.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Jobs are everywhere, and all you need to do is find them. If you&rsquo;ve spent years already looking for another job and still can&rsquo;t find one, there is definitely something wrong with how you do it. If you know you have the skills and experience that will make you a valuable member of an organization, then you should find work.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;My salary now is too good to give up.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> This is one of those beliefs that have prevented many from finding what they really love to do. Although income is a serious consideration to make when choosing a career, you cannot forever be enslaved by it! Money can be earned by any means, but happiness and fulfillment can&rsquo;t. Doing something that&rsquo;s close to your heart is certainly the best investment you could make.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I am so much needed in my company.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> You have to face it; everyone in the corporate world is replaceable. No matter how good you are in what you do, there is still a great chance that your employer will look for someone better than you. You should focus more on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your own career planning  </a> </u>  and don&rsquo;t be too concerned about what may happen to your company when you leave.</p>",

    "link": "why-doesnt-anyone-want-the-top-jobs-anymore",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I know I don&rsquo;t. I know most of my friends who are also baby boomers don&rsquo;t. We, of a certain demographic, are leaving Corporate America in droves. Every week I&rsquo;m meeting up with friends of friends who want to hear my story of <strong>  why and how I left and what it takes to go out on your own. </strong> That&rsquo;s been steadily going on now over the last four years since I pulled the plug on my corporate human resources career. We all joke about &ldquo;voting ourselves off the corporate island,&rdquo; but the situation really isn&rsquo;t funny.</p><p> In the last year my tea dates have gotten younger and younger while, (sigh) I still get older. The millennials are now joining the party in large numbers. As numerous recent articles and studies are showing, <strong>  millennial workers are saying that they simply don&rsquo;t aspire to take on senior level roles. </strong> It&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t believe they have the skills and smarts to do the job, many just don&rsquo;t feel that it is the right path for them and worth the effort.</p><p> Years ago someone thankfully kicked the crap out of the old notion of a career ladder where you moved up one rung at a time. Instead we all began to focus more on building a portfolio of skills and taking lateral moves to gain additional experience to broaden our skill set. But, what didn&rsquo;t change was the thinking that eventually you&rsquo;d end up at or near the top. Until recently, that is. Now, people are saying, both with their voices and their feet that their goal isn&rsquo;t to rise to the top.</p><p> So, is this all due to the massive percentage of workers that identify themselves as disengaged or other factors? Frankly it&rsquo;s a bit of everything. <strong>  With 68.5% of the US workforce disengaged </strong> according to the Gallup Institute (87% globally), it&rsquo;s easy to simply lay blame here, <strong>  but I&rsquo;m also hearing from engaged people who just don&rsquo;t have the desire to take on the stress and pressure that comes with the top jobs. </strong> When I talk to my peers who have walked away, I hear things like &ldquo;I have nothing left to prove&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want to do something that has meaning and I can change lives.&rdquo;</p><p> Perhaps to combat the epidemic of disengagement or it&rsquo;s just the world we live in today, there is an overwhelming number of people jumping on the bandwagon to talk about how we need to have meaning at work, find our purpose and be happy. Every day I get an email with links to articles on these subjects or inviting me to attend conferences or webinars designed around passion and happiness. Admit it, our curiosity gets peaked when someone promises us we can be happy at work instead of sad, frustrated and miserable. Of course, in the moment we forget that we also have to pay the bills and have health insurance.</p><p> What my friends and I have figured out is that <strong>  it is so much better to work to thrive, rather than work just to survive. </strong> However, being the more conservative types that most baby boomers are (having had parents that were depression era babies), we saved a lot to be able to have choices later in our career. What scares me a bit, but also makes me jealous, is that <strong>  millennial workers are not worrying about having the money to make life changing career decisions, they just do what feels right for them in the moment. </strong> Given this, how can companies hope to keep them around while grooming them for more responsibility?</p><p> It starts with figuring out what makes them tick, what makes them excited to get up in the morning and come in to work, what is going to give them meaning and purpose in the workplace. It also starts with figuring out how they can have a successful career while not sacrificing their life-work balance outside of the office. And while we are on this subject, let&rsquo;s not forget about our GenXers. They sometimes get lost in the squeeze of worrying about losing the incredible knowledge and experience of the baby boomers and the potential of the millennial generation.</p><p> <strong>  We need to turn back to the basics of creating an engaging work environment where people of all generations can buy in, go all in and remain within while contributing to the passion and mission of the company and worry less about what their job titles are, now and in the future. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MitchellTuchman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mitch Tuchman  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.rebalance-ira.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Rebalance IRA  </u> </a></p><p> This week on the  Retire With More  show we had a very special returning guest, our very own Sally Brandon. Sally joined us as we took a closer look at the differences between how men and  <a href=\"http://www.rebalance-ira.com/expert-advice/women-retirement-investing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   women invest for retirement  </u>  . </a>  You may be surprised to learn that when it comes to who can be a better retirement investor &mdash; who can take their money, their nest egg, their savings and compound it on a long-term basis and end up with a better result &mdash; it&rsquo;s women.</p><p> While women have the potential to be a better investor for retirement, they are much more fearful. In this week&rsquo;s episode, we broke down the top five biggest fears that women face when it comes to investing and how they can overcome these fears and actually outperform the men in their lives.</p><h3> Fear #1 &mdash; Not having saved enough money to maintain your lifestyle</h3><p> <br/> Women&rsquo;s biggest fear is whether or not they have saved enough money. While &ldquo;enough&rdquo; for most means not having enough to maintain their current lifestyle, some women go so far as to fear that they will not have enough money to take them through the rest of their life and even believe that they are going to end up on the street.</p><p> &ldquo;I urge all women to really take control of the controllables and to add to that by creating a financial plan. Plan for the worst so that you can feel in control and hope for the best. Look at your spending habits and look at what you are saving. If you are not where you need to be, then set goals to put money aside at a steady pace to eventually get there.&rdquo;  &mdash; Sally Brandon</p><h3> Fear #2 &mdash; Not being smart enough or confident enough to know what to do and how to do it</h3><p> <br/> Women&rsquo;s second biggest fear when it comes to financial matters is that they do not feel smart enough. They don&rsquo;t feel like they know what they are doing or how to do it and because of that they do not feel like they can make good decisions. At  <strong>  Rebalance IRA </strong>  we believe that women should no longer take the back seat.</p><p> &ldquo;Women need to learn about investing and get up there in the front seat with their husbands. There are so many financial blogs out there that they can read to familiarize themselves and get comfortable with the terminology in the financial world. Learn more about what your options are and what investment instruments are available to you. If it means seeking out a professional financial planner or an investment advisor, finding someone that you can trust, I think it is really important and it will go a long way in building that confidence.&rdquo;  &mdash; Sally Brandon</p><h3> Fear #3 &mdash; Losing money</h3><p> <br/> Women in general are afraid of losing money. They are afraid of losing money in the market and they worry about not having money on hand for emergencies. As a result, instead of putting money into the market where it can grow, they are holding on to it in cash or in really low-interest accounts.</p><p> &ldquo;In order to grow your wealth, money that is earmarked for down the road, it is important to move out of cash, and if it is invested wisely you can benefit from the money compounding over time. If you invest in a smart way by putting your money in investment vehicles like index funds, the fear of losing money is really not a fear that you need to worry about.&rdquo;  &mdash; Sally Brandon</p><h3> Fear #4 &mdash; Burdening your children</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.rebalance-ira.com/news/dont-be-too-generous-with-college-money-one-financial-advisers-story/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Women by nature are caretakers  </u>  . </a>  They are always taking care of everybody else, so they are not as comfortable with the thought of somebody else taking care of them. By getting control of their finances and putting together a plan, women are not only doing themselves a favor but they are also setting a good example and will raise financially responsible, independent children.</p><p> &ldquo;Being a mother, I think my instinct is to want to pay for everything for my son for college and maybe put off my own retirement. In reality though, that would be doing myself and, quite honestly, my children a disservice in the future, where they could take a loan out for college and I can&rsquo;t take a loan out for retirement. Not only that, but then I could potentially be a burden for them later in life.&rdquo;  &mdash; Sally Brandon</p><h3> Fear #5 &mdash; Not being able to support yourself if you never get married</h3><p> <br/> Women worry that if they do not get married, then they will never be able to support themselves, which in reality is not true. Some women have this &ldquo;princess mentality&rdquo; that it&rsquo;s better to marry a high-earning man because your husband will determine the standard of living for you and your children. The problem with a princess mentality is that it takes away this internal locus of control, which is the belief that you are responsible for making your own way in the world.</p><p> &ldquo;I think it is important to figure out whether you have a &lsquo;princess mentality&rsquo; or not, and if so to get over it.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rebalance-ira.com/news/after-divorce-build-the-financial-future-you-want/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   You are in control. We can fend for ourselves.  </a> </u>  Women are very successful at working and saving. It&rsquo;s very important that women know that they could do it on their own should they have to.&rdquo;  &mdash; Sally Brandon</p>",

    "title": "6 Critical Ways Financial Advisors Can Do Better Marketing",
    "link": "6-critical-ways-financial-advisors-can-do-better-marketing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In having spent time in my career marketing financial services, I know that there are some really effective ways financial advisors can market their brands that doesn&rsquo;t require a large budget or support. Marketing resources are often limited within the financial services industry and this can be a real pain point for advisors who are responsible for bringing in new business for their practice or the firm they work for. That is why the six tips I am about to share with you can be executed on by you alone, so if you don&rsquo;t have a huge budget or human support &ndash; no problem.</p><p> As a personal brand whose business is based on forming strong, lasting relationships with your clients, pay attention to these six critical ways you can improve your marketing through the efforts you are likely already doing.</p><h3> 1. Set Specific Goals</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t confuse asset or sales responsibility with marketing goals. Too often, the overwhelming pressure to bring in new assets under management prevents financial advisors from setting incremental marketing goals that help you towards achieving your overall growth responsibility. Instead, use your growth number to work backwards and set very specific marketing goals. As a simple example, if you are responsible for bringing in $4mm of new assets under management per year, that&rsquo;s roughly $333k a month. Let&rsquo;s just say your average account is around $100k or 3.3 clients per month, 40 clients per year. Now that you have your hard growth numbers clearly understood, switch your mindset from numbers of accounts and assets to marketing efforts that will help you most effectively reach, attract, convert and close your ideal relationship.</p><p> <strong>  An example of a great, specific goal a financial advisor might have is: Build personal brand credibility with corporate lawyers specializing in mergers &amp; acquisitions. </strong></p><p> When your goals point back to your target audience, you are that much more likely to succeed because you are able to focus your efforts rather than dilute them across general audiences and channels. And side note: saying your target market is anyone with investible assets of $100k is NOT identifying a target market. &ldquo;People who have money&rdquo; is not clear enough.</p><h3> 2. Have a Plan</h3><p> Financial planners and advisors, this should be second nature to you. You know that your clients can&rsquo;t achieve their financial goals without a well-documented strategy and neither can you.  So why are you still operating without one? A well-developed marketing plan will cover the very important: Who, What, When, Why, Where and How questions. If you can answer  <strong>  who </strong>  your client is,  <strong>  what </strong>  value your product or service adds to their life,  <strong>  when </strong>  they give attention and make a decision,  <strong>  why </strong>  they should choose your product or service over anyone else&rsquo;s,  <strong>  where </strong>  they will encounter your brand and  <strong>  where </strong>  they will commit and howyou are going to deliver your message and measure success&hellip; I think you have a pretty darn clear start. Don&rsquo;t overthink it. These questions should be easy to answer and should point back to your marketing goal.</p><p> Go here to read my blog post  <u>  <a href=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/business-sense/uncomplicated-marketing-strategy-for-small-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Uncomplicated Marketing Strategy  </a> </u>  for additional insight into this area.</p><p> In the example, the financial advisor&rsquo;s marketing goal was to: Build personal brand credibility with corporate lawyers specializing in mergers &amp; acquisitions. What is your plan to build that credibility? What efforts should you focus on to reach that very specific goal with that very clear audience? This financial advisor would be better served to spend as much time as possible with these attorneys to understand what they care about and need the most that way the advisor can make sure he is providing the most value to this audience and in turn, building his own credibility in the process. Don&rsquo;t waste your time, efforts or budget on any activity that doesn&rsquo;t support your goal with your target audience. Be a resource to your audience, not a financial mouth-piece trying to tell them all about you and your practice. When you do, you are &ndash; but not before then.</p><p> A good plan must be actionable not theoretical. A great plan measures and keeps track of actions and their effect. Decide what you will do, how you will measure effectiveness, and then do it.</p><h3> 3. Get Online and Be Social</h3><p> It&rsquo;s long overdue for financial advisors to stop hiding behind the curtain of compliance as their excuse for not using social media to connect with your target audience. Don&rsquo;t make any promises. Don&rsquo;t make any claims about returns. Don&rsquo;t post anything that could be misleading from the truth. And don&rsquo;t share client testimonials. If you have a compliance approval process for your firm&rsquo;s social media policy, follow it and you should be good to go.</p><p> It is also time stop saying that your audience isn&rsquo;t online. Yes they are, in increasing numbers. Here are the facts you should know ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Source: Pew Research Center  </a> </u> ):</p><li> <strong>  71% of adult internet users / 58% of entire adult population are using Facebook. </strong></li><li> <strong>  73% of adult internet users on Facebook are between the ages of 30 and 49. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Some 56% of internet users ages 65 and older now use Facebook, up from 45% who did so in late 2013 and 35% who did so in late 2012. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Some 23% of online adults currently use Twitter, a statistically significant increase compared with the 18% who did so in August 2013. </strong></li><li> <strong>  25% of adult Twitter users are between the ages of 30 and 49. </strong></li><li> <strong>  26% of adult internet users / 21% of entire adult population uses Instagram. </strong></li><li> <strong>  28% of online adults use Pinterest. </strong></li><li> <strong>  28% of online adults are LinkedIn users, up from 22% in August 2013. The site continues to be particularly popular among college graduates, those in higher-income households and the employed </strong> <br/>  </li><p> If you work for a Registered Investment Advisory or a Broker Dealer, you are still a personal brand and online social channels are perfectly designed to help you effectively share value to your audience through your personal social media accounts. I suggest starting with the social platform that your target audience is using the most and master that channel first before adopting another one. Better to be successful at one than paltry at many. Each platform has certain etiquette you should be aware of and follow. I also recommend you trust the 30/60/10 Golden Rule of social sharing: 30% of what you share should be Owned (valuable content created by you) / 60% Curated (other people&rsquo;s content) / 10% should be promotional. Too often, financial services is promotional-heavy, which does not encourage trust or add that much value to your audience.</p><p> Lastly, if you have time to check your emails and go out for coffee &ndash; you have time for social media. Schedule time for it on your calendar so that it becomes part of your routine and you&rsquo;ll be just fine. With purpose, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be a time-suck.</p><h3> 4. Write</h3><p> No excuses. Seriously.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Writes-Creating-Ridiculously-Content/dp/1501200607\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Everybody Writes by Ann Handley  </a> </u>  is a great book you might consider reading to be convinced and guided. Having a voice and sharing your messages through writing is more important now than ever before. As a financial advisor, you have knowledge you can share to add value with your target audience and build your credibility. Instead of telling people what you know, you are able to demonstrate your knowledge and value through what you write. Writing can seem like a daunting task, especially if you don&rsquo;t consider yourself a particularly good writer. But don&rsquo;t hold yourself back and make excuses. You can always consider investing in a content marketer or writer to help you through this process. Collaboration between the marketer/writer and advisor will make for the most effective content that represents your expertise and unique brand voice. The financial advisors who take the time to invest in their personal brand and write will be setting themselves up for success. They will be the ones with the greatest credibility. They will be the ones who can easily attract the ideal market. And they will be the ones who are pursued for speaking opportunities and other PR opportunties that are highly sought after within the financial services industry.</p><h3> 5. Qualify BEFORE</h3><p> Marketing time management is important. Financial advisors are very busy people. Most often you are responsible for serving your clients and business development. Therefore, there is a premium on your time that you should be very protective of when it comes to marketing activities. Face-to-face is extremely important in financial services. You are in a relationship-based industry and you need that one-on-one time to really establish and cultivate a meaningful relationship that will hopefully lead to a client. That being said, run your networking like a business so that you don&rsquo;t waste precious time with people who are not a good fit with your business right off the bat. Do you have a process for qualifying leads? If not, I highly recommend you create one. A friendly 30-minute pre-meet phone call to learn more about the person and their needs is all it should take to find out if they meet your practice&rsquo;s requirements or if you can/want to serve them. Most firms operate with a minimum investable assets under management requirement or portfolio size. And most often, these minimums exist because the firm&rsquo;s products and services best serve portfolios of a certain size. The bottom line is that the time you spend with unqualified prospects does affect your bottom line. What is your time worth and how can you get to a point where your sit-downs are more profitable? Qualifying beforehand can go a long way to help you and can keep you very focused in your efforts.</p><h3> 6. Follow-up</h3><p> For as much time as you spend planning an event, schmoozing at an event, creating a campaign, participating in networking groups, and all the other activities that require a lot of time and energy&hellip; you should be spending as much time, if not more, on following-up. This is probably one of the biggest challenges for financial advisors. You are great at building the momentum and throwing your energy into filling a room with prospects or getting involved in a board or an association, but then there is too often a failure to follow-up after you&rsquo;ve made great connections. All following-up should mean to you is relationship building. Now that you have made a connection with potential clients, how do you stay in touch with them and try to earn their consideration? If you thought getting their attention was a lot of work, you need to work even harder to keep their attention. Part of your plan should have very clear actions you will take to help your ideal customer know who you are, consider your service, and make a decision. It is on you to create an experience for your ideal customer to easily choose you as their advisor.</p><p> If your firm hosts an event and 25% of attendees are qualified prospects, you should have a clear follow-up protocol in place for yourself for your prospects with calls to action. What do you want them to do? Your efforts should be personalized, but you should have a fairly systematized follow-up procedure so that you stay in touch with qualified leads and also make it easy for them to decide yes!</p><p> Simple examples:</p><li> Day after an event, send personalized follow-up email thanking them for attending  <strong>  and schedule a one-on-one lunch. </strong></li><li> After one-on-one lunch, send email thanking them with another invitation (if more consideration is needed) OR with  <strong>  promotional information and proposal </strong>  (if in decision stage). <br/>  </li><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> You can align your marketing efforts with your growth responsibility and your ideal customer in a really meaningful way by giving special attention to these six critical activities. Consistency and sustainability will be your marketing effort&rsquo;s best friend. You don&rsquo;t need to do everything and you don&rsquo;t need a fortune. But you do need to have a plan and follow a process to reach your goals and sustain your efforts. You are in an industry that is highly relevant and always current. Set yourself up for marketing success so you can spend less time stressing about the marketing and business development and more time doing what you love most: serving your very special clients.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Brawls over   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    estate plans   </a>  </u>   are common. </strong> They usually occur after the death of a primary  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   beneficiary  </a> </u> . In the case of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/tom-benson/\" target=\"_blank\">   Tom Benson  </a> </u>  and his family, the game started early.</p><p>  Worth an estimated $1.87 billion, Tom Benson is a self-made man who built a fortune leveraging car dealerships and banking institutions. In addition to his businesses, Mr. Benson also owns two sports franchises, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.neworleanssaints.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   New Orleans Saints  </a> </u>  in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League\" target=\"_blank\">   National Football League  </a> </u>  (NFL), and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/pelicans/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pelicans  </a> </u> , a  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association\" target=\"_blank\">   National Basketball Association  </a> </u>  (NBA) franchise.</p><p> Now 87, Mr. Benson created a family firestorm in January of this year by  <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2015/01/benson_family_battle_for_saint.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  attempting to transition </a>  assets previously placed in <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irrevocabletrust.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  irrevocable trusts </a>  for the benefit of his grandchild, Renee Benson and her two children. If the asset transfer sought by Mr. Benson is approved, control and primary ownership of the sports franchises would pass to the third wife of Mr. Benson, who he married in 2004, after the death of his second wife.</p><p> Renee Benson has long been groomed as the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/heir.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   heir  </a> </u>  apparent to the sports empire created by her grandfather. Shortly after Ms. Benson and her children received word they were being cut out of future control of the business, they filed a lawsuit to have Mr. Benson declared mentally fit.</p><p> Believing her grandfather  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undue-influence.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   unduly influenced  </a> </u>  by his current wife,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.expressnews.com/business/local/article/Gayle-Benson-s-past-now-in-the-spotlight-6078267.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gayle Benson  </a> </u> , Rene Benson sought a court ruling giving her authority to protect the property and &ldquo;person&rdquo; of Mr. Benson. In February, a court found the following:</p><li> Benson is under significant pressure.</li><li> Help should be provided to Mr. Benson in managing his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   assets  </a>  . </u></li><li> Two  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receivership\" target=\"_blank\">   receivers  </a> </u>  were appointed to help Mr. Benson. <br/>  </li><p> Since then, the receivers focused their investigation on the Shirley Benson trust; this trust holds the assets at issue in the case. Control of the fate of the teams appears to rest in the declaration of the ownership of the business assets.</p><p> Mr. Benson holds half the company&mdash;plus one share&mdash;and Renee Benson and her two children own the rest. In a court filing, the receiver&rsquo;s report they do not believe Mr. Benson is entitled to the one extra share that imparts control of the businesses interests held in trust. The receivers recommend the extra share be split, or given to the Shirley Benson trust&mdash;a move that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/end%20run\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   end runs  </a> </u>  the attempt of Mr. Benson to call the shots.</p><p> As multiple lawsuits play out, the results of a medical examination of Mr. Benson are expected soon. Is Mr. Benson being inappropriately influenced by his wife to cut out his long-time heirs? Is Renee Benson herself seeking undue influence? Is it a little of both? Time and the court will tell.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Maybe it&rsquo;s that the internet doesn&rsquo;t need just another rant about American Airlines.</h3><p> <br/> Or maybe I&rsquo;m just a fan of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3dYS7PcAG4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Louis CK&rsquo;s bit about the magic of flight  </a> </u> . Regardless, I want to assure you that this post is not, strictly speaking, a rant about my recent experience using the @AmericanAir mobile app. Tempting though that may be. Instead, this post is about Product &amp; Brand&hellip; though I may still rant a little bit.</p><p> One of the really nice features of the American Airlines app is the ability to see the status of your incoming flight &ndash; the plane you will be flying on. Which means that, in theory, if my incoming flight is showing that it is delayed (critical data), the mobile app should also register that my outbound flight &ndash; you know, the one that is using the plane that is not going to be there because it's delayed &ndash; is also going to be delayed (accurate information). </p><p> Which, as anyone who has used the American Air app knows, and I discovered yesterday, is NOT what happens. Instead, there appears to be no correlation whatsoever between the anticipated arrival time of your inbound flight and the estimated departure status of your outbound flight. In other words, the airline has the critical data it needs, it&rsquo;s right there in the app, it just failed to translate that into accurate information its customers can use. The resulting disconnect - between what the app was telling me about my flight (it&rsquo;s ON TIME!) and the arriving flight information (it&rsquo;s DELAYED) - didn't leave me feeling empowered by data. Instead, because of the conflicting information, the app left me with the a more unsatisfying feeling that the airline had no idea when my flight was actually going to leave. Which, I think we could all agree, is not good for customer loyalty. #understatement</p><p> Ironically, when I tweeted about this disconnect yesterday, the airline&rsquo;s social media response was to thank me for my patience. The thing is, my dissatisfaction with the product's failure had nothing to do with patience or impatience. My dissatisfaction was with the absence of accurate information, which gets to the heart of the entanglement of Product &amp; Brand:</p><h3> Brand infuses product with meaning (the why) while product validates the brand (proof of the why)</h3><p>  </p><p> From a customer experience perspective, it is the seamless engagement with the product that powers the confidence loop necessary for customer loyalty in the first place. Conversely, when the product fails to deliver, at any touchpoint, it undermines confidence in the brand. In this instance, for me trying to plan my arrival at the airport based on the information provided by the airline, the app's failure to effectively translate critical data into accurate information was a fail. The result? not only did it damage my trust in the product, it also undermined my loyalty to the brand. </p><p> So, what's the point of all this ranting? Brand is about more - much more - than simply marketing. It is about the entirety of the customer experience of the company and the products that it offers. It is thus ironic that this product fail, like so many, is neither difficult, nor expensive, to fix (this one seems quite simple, really). All that it takes is a relentless focus on the confidence loop of product and brand, and a commitment by the company to delivering on both. The question (in every instance) is - does the brand care enough to try?</p><p> Agree? Disagree? Hey, that&rsquo;s what the comments are for!</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;The other day, a customer tweeted at me, &lsquo;Are you a bot?&rsquo; At first I was really offended and wanted to tweet back &lsquo;I AM NOT A BOT!&rsquo; But when I thought about it some more, I got kind-of sad. I realized that by following the scripts and all the rules, I sounded very robotic. That&rsquo;s not what our customers want or need. They come to social media because they want some upbeat and friendly interaction. I could provide better service if they gave us a bit more freedom to do what we know is right.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> &ndash; Customer Service Social Media Rep</p><p> It&rsquo;s not just social media reps who feel that way. It happens across industries at all levels. I&rsquo;ve met VPs whose fear has caused a dangerous bot-like trance. Bots leading bots is no way to change the game.</p><p> Sadly, it starts with good intentions: an effort to get everyone on the same page; a PR team who wants to ensure all employees share the same story; or efficiency studies that show the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to do things saves much more time. I once had a boss tell me, &ldquo;Karin, the truth is in that role, I want to take all the thinking out of it, make it as simple as possible so they can just execute efficiently.&rdquo;</p><p> Sometimes your employees will tell you. But often, they just subtly lose their passion for your work and find meaning elsewhere.</p><h3> 5 Signs Your Employee Feels Like A Bot</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. They stop asking important questions. </strong></p><p> The &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; questions disappear.</p><p> <strong>  2. But&hellip; they don&rsquo;t make a move without asking obvious questions. </strong></p><p> They need approval for everything, even if it means keeping a customer waiting. Most of your answers are &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  3. They &ldquo;follow the rules&rdquo; even when they don&rsquo;t make sense. </strong></p><p> Of course they should have made an exception for the customer whose son just died. But the guidebook didn&rsquo;t say, so they stuck by the rules. It&rsquo;s impossible to predict and script every scenario. If an employee can&rsquo;t function outside the playbook, check for bot-building policies.</p><p> <strong>  4. Meetings are lifeless. </strong></p><p> Your meetings look like a scene from an old zombie movie. It&rsquo;s like pulling teeth to get everyone to talk. You feel like a cheerleader in an empty stadium.</p><p> <strong>  5. Even well-thought out recognition, compensation, and employee engagement programs don&rsquo;t make a dent. </strong></p><p> If employees could double their hourly wage if they just &ldquo;embraced the program&rdquo; you first need a shift from bot gear, before any incentive overlay will work.</p><p> The guy I worked for was wrong. Because I&rsquo;m not a bot, I ignored that advice, and results improved. You can&rsquo;t grow a bot. You can&rsquo;t motivate a bot. Bots will never deliver a best in class customer experience.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> No More Hiding From Twitter As &lsquo;Far-ranging&rsquo; Google Partnership Begins</h3><p> <br/> A development on the other side of The Pond last week should send shivers down the spines of any remaining C-suite Twitter cynics here in the UK.</p><p> That's because, as reported by the always-excellent Econsultancy, a new partnership between Google and Twitter has started to roll out, which seems certain to have huge long-term repercussions on SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) rankings.</p><p> Given Google's continued dominance of the search market (see chart from Statista below), SERPs rankings have become the lifeblood of tens of thousands of UK businesses, ranging from one man bands to the biggest PLCs.  And although - as Econsultancy points out - only time will tell in terms of the full implications of this new partnership, my advice is to start planning for a world in which Twitter's influence on the world of search moves to a completely new level.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,h_2000,q_80,w_1200/v1/75010/google_market_share_ujfzgs.jpg\"/><p> Needless to say, this is terrific news for those brands who have been carefully cultivating their Twitter strategy over recent years. On the other hand, assuming things pan out as I expect, it could have profound long-term implications - and necessitate a hasty reordering of marketing priorities - for companies that had previously not taken Twitter seriously as a marketing tool.</p><p> As Econsultancy puts it, the Google-Twitter deal will bring tweets \"deep into the SERPs\", with the result that the already thin boundaries between search and social media will blur still more.</p><p> The initial impact of this new SERPs regime is being seen by mobile users in the U.S. But, be in no doubt, this will be rolled out worldwide over the coming months. And, once that happens, the days when it was possible for a brand to operate without a cohesive Twitter strategy will, I&rsquo;m certain, be numbered.</p><p> In a statement about the new SERPs regime, Google says that the new Twitter-based results offer \"a great way to get real-time info when something is happening. And it&rsquo;s another way for organizations and people on Twitter to reach a global audience at the most relevant moments.\"</p><p> Typically Econsultancy goes right to the heart of the matter from a commercial perspective, underlining why business owners and marketers should be taking this development VERY seriously:</p><p> \"The implications&hellip;could be significant and far-ranging. For instance, brand marketers may find that the content they're distributing on Twitter could soon have a much broader audience, reaching consumers who are searching for their brands on Google. That could be good news for content marketers that have a well-oiled Twitter operation.</p><p> \"On the other hand, marketers may also find that reputation management on Twitter becomes even more important as what people are saying about their brands on Twitter could make it into the SERPs.</p><p> \"That could be bad news, as crisis management on Twitter can be very challenging and firestorms, often sparked by small but vocal minorities of users, are hard to predict.\"</p><p> So what should you be doing if your company isn't on Twitter or, if you are, your account is at the rusty end of the &lsquo;well-oiled&rsquo; spectrum?</p><p> In the short term, it makes sense to keep an eagle eye on your company's relevant Google search rankings once the UK rollout starts in the coming months, so that you can see if (or more likely 'when') your position for key search terms starts to be directly affected.</p><p> But sitting on your hands, watching your SERPs position glide gently south - and leaving your brand strategy in the lap of the social media gods - is clearly no marketing plan.  So, in the medium to long term, you'll need to consider far more positive action.</p><p> For most companies - whether B2B or B2C - this means a review of your Twitter strategy to ensure it is fit-for-purpose in the new era of search and social convergence. If not then you'll need to push Twitter way up your list of marketing priorities because it will no longer be just a 'nice to have' tool sitting in a social media &lsquo;silo&rsquo;, but rather an integral element of your wider search, communications and brand strategy.</p><p> And what if your company is a B2B without the time / expertise / resources to develop a coherent Twitter strategy to cope with whatever this brave new world of SERPs throws at you?</p><p> If that&rsquo;s the case you could do a lot worse than drop me an email and we&rsquo;ll take it from there!</p>",

    "content": "<p> While retirement may seem a long way off when you&rsquo;re young and just starting to build a business &ndash; or older and rebooting &ndash; it&rsquo;s important to have a retirement savings plan and stick to it to create the future you want.</p><p> Retirement planning can be difficult for anyone, but entrepreneurs and small business owners can face unique challenges. According to a 2013 American Express survey,  <strong>  60 percent </strong>  of small business owners said they weren&rsquo;t saving enough for retirement, and over  <strong>  73 percent </strong>  said they were worried about not being able to afford the lifestyle they want in retirement.</p><p> While many employees can choose to make automatic deductions from their paycheck towards a 401k, for instance, entrepreneurs have to make a conscious decision to sock away money for retirement, as well as find plans that work for them.</p><p> Fortunately there are several things that you can begin doing now to contributing to your long-term financial future. As always, please review these and other options with your financial planner to see what strategy may be most suitable for your individual situation.</p><h3> 1) Open an IRA</h3><p> <br/> If you haven&rsquo;t already, now may be as good a time as any to open an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). IRAs are long term investments that allow you to save money for the future in a tax efficient way. They also offer catch up contributions if you&rsquo;re over 50.</p><p> <strong>  Traditional vs. Roth </strong></p><p> Traditional IRAs allow you to deduct contributions the year in which they are made, then pay taxes when you withdraw the money. A Roth IRA allows you to pay taxes on your contributions now, rather than upon withdrawal and earnings and distributions may not be taxable if held in the Roth IRA for up to 5 years.</p><p> For older investors who are approaching retirement, traditional IRAs probably make more sense, as their tax rate may likely be lower in retirement than it is currently. Younger investors, however, may want to consider a Roth IRA if they believe their tax rate could be higher in the future than when they make their contributions.</p><p> <strong>  Contribution Limitations </strong></p><p> Regardless of whether you elect to contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA the IRS sets annual limits each year stating the maximum individuals can contribute to their IRA based on their annual earnings. For instance, in 2015 you are limited to a maximum of  <strong>  $5,500 </strong>  annually (or  <strong>  $6,500 </strong>  if you are 50 or over).</p><p> Finally, with either type of IRA, there are penalties and taxes for early withdrawals prior to 59 &frac12; years old!</p><p> Please consult your tax professional regarding your specific situation and the specific rules that apply to you.</p><h3> 2) Consider alternative forms of IRAs to increase your contribution limits</h3><p> <br/> If you are your company&rsquo;s only employee, or you only have a couple of other employees, you may want to look into setting up either an  <strong>  SEP-IRA or a SIMPLE-IRA </strong> .</p><p> <strong>  SEP-IRA </strong></p><p> <strong>  SEP-IRAs </strong>  allow you to contribute up to 25% of your salary, or $53,000 (as of 2015) whichever is smaller. This is significantly more than what non-SEP-IRAs allow for.</p><p> Setting up a  <strong>  SEP-IRA  </strong> may be an easy choice if you and your spouse are your only employees, but there can be other costs associated if you have other people working for you.</p><p> <strong>  SIMPLE-IRAs </strong></p><p> SIMPLE-IRAs provide an alternative that is cheaper for companies with several employees.</p><p> With the  <strong>  SIMPLE-IRA </strong> , the employer creates an IRA for each employee. Employees have the option to contribute a certain percentage of their income to their IRA. Employers are then required to match that percentage up to a maximum of three percent of the person&rsquo;s salary, or contribute two percent of each person&rsquo;s salary into the IRA.</p><p> By creating a  <strong>  SIMPLE-IRA </strong>  the owner is then able to contribute an additional $12,500 ($15,500 for those 50 and over) to his or her own IRA.</p><p> If you have only a few employees working for you and you expect to contribute either the full $12,500 or a large portion of it, there is a good chance that your tax savings may more than pay for the cost of contributing to your employee&rsquo;s IRAs. Please consult your tax professional for more specific information about how this could affect you and your employees.</p><h3> 3) Setup Automatic Deductions</h3><p> <br/> Unfortunately, we all have a tendency to procrastinate, and thinking about retirement is often not at the top of our priorities! It&rsquo;s easy for entrepreneurs and small business owners in particular to become distracted and forget to contribute to your retirement account(s). Automatic deductions solve this problem.</p><p> By setting up your IRA and other retirement accounts to take money directly out of your bank account or paycheck each week (or month,) you can ensure that you contribute as much money as you feel you can, up to the full tax deductible amount, each year. You no longer have to worry about forgetting to, or putting off, contributing.</p><p> With any IRA, think carefully about how much you can realistically contribute. They are considered long term investments and you cannot access the money prior to a specific age without incurring taxes and significant penalties for making early withdrawals. Please make sure you are carefully considering your short and medium term goals. And remember: starting to save early is a good way to get on the road to achieving your goals.</p><h3> 4) Speak with as Experienced Financial Planner to Help You Create a Plan</h3><p> <br/> Taking care of long-term financial goals can be a challenge but fortunately you don&rsquo;t have to go it alone. Financial planning professionals can help you create an individualized plan focused on your specific goals. Whether they are:</p><li> Saving for retirement</li><li> Saving for your children&rsquo;s education</li><li> Buying a home</li><li> Having a baby <br/>  </li><p> Financial planners are here to help you plan for the future you envision for yourself and your family.</p>",

    "content": "<p> There are many discourses which explore how we show up in our body.  Each has a slightly different approach but many explore the four basic body dispositions or styles, which we will examine in this and future blogs. As we start to explore how our bodies impact our leadership, a great place to begin is a discussion of a body that has been called the Joker, the Expressive, or the Flexible body. Regardless of what you call it, in this body we see the following:</p><h3> Overall view of the world: </h3><p> This is the body of the creative, dreamers, inventors, adventurers, and those who are ready to try anything. This body allows one to take risks, to live in the spontaneity of the moment.</p><h3> Moods and Emotions: </h3><p> The flexibility of this body allows moods and emotions to readily manifest and be perceptible to others. Whether quick to anger, happiness, sadness, or joy, this body is ready and able to show the emotion to the world. When the emotion is negative, this body lets the world know that all is not well. It lets those nearby know that little is possible, and others feel its pain. When the mood or emotion is positive, this body radiates this to the world, allowing acceptance, boldness, fun, and possibility to flow.</p><h3> How it manifests in the body: </h3><p> The body is loose and flexible, but there is an underlying intensity, a readiness for movement at any time based on the emotion that arises. Mobility in the face ranges from relaxed to intense, again related to the emotion that is revealed, and the eyes are scanning the horizon, acting as the scouts for the body. The mouth and is open and wide in wonder and exploration. In its base state the feet are not planted firmly on the ground, the knees are not locked; the legs are not trying to tie the body to the ground, but rather like springs, ready to move to action. The arms and hands are moving and balancing the body, keeping it in a state of spontaneity. The energy and movement of the body is dynamic and quickly accessible, prepared for whatever comes next.</p><h3> The Mantra of this body: </h3><p> The mantra that arises in this body is, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try this,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Whatever happens, we are ready to move with it.&rdquo;</p><h3> Where this body might serve or hinder you: </h3><p> The advantages to this body are that it allows you go with the flow, or against the flow, whatever you think or feel is necessary. This allows for creativity and exploration, and is great in new situations where the unknown is at hand and a spontaneous and creative approach will serve you. However, this body will be a challenge when faced with repetitive or rigidly prescribed tasks or situations where creativity is not needed or appreciated.</p><p> You can see how being the joker at work could many times be an asset &ndash; most people will find you fun, your emotional transparency refreshing, and your energy and creativity inspiring. But, too much of the joker can leave others doing the grunt work, cause resentment, too much drama, and harm your credibility as a leader.</p>",

    "link": "target-clientele-why-cant-i-just-target-everyone",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s a good question.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no doubt that most planners could add value to most people. However, the question isn&rsquo;t around whether you can, but instead whether you should.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at this from a business perspective. You have two core options when it comes to growing a business. </p><p> <strong>  Option 1: Target everyone. </strong> The pros are that if your business nails it &ndash; you discover a genuine and unfulfilled need a large portion of the population is aware of, wants solved and places value and urgency on solving &ndash; then the sky can be the limit. The cons are that it can be costly and difficult to do. Failure rates are high. More than ever before, getting a marketing message out to the mass market is hard. There is much noise and, when you&rsquo;re trying to talk to everyone, you can end up saying very little to anyone.</p><p> <strong>  Option 2 is to design your business offerings and model to target specific type of client(s). </strong>  This option makes it easier and cheaper to connect with them and get them to listen to what your business has to say. A perceived downside is you&rsquo;re, by definition, cutting out some potential clients.</p><p> However, most SME advice businesses don&rsquo;t want hundreds of thousands of clients. Most just want a select number who love what they do and are willing to pay for it.</p><p> So, unless you believe there is a genuine scarcity of potential clients, as in there are just not enough to go around, being specific shouldn&rsquo;t matter. After all, when there are lots of them, you can afford to be picky</p><p> In actual fact, if that&rsquo;s the situation and you want to build efficiencies in your business, wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense to try and provide advice you have experience in and can do more efficiently than someone starting from scratch?</p><p> The other option is that you believe scarcity is an issue. You believe there are only so many clients. Even then, there is a strong argument that focusing on the few instead of the many remains a better strategy for that too. If you don&rsquo;t stand out from the pack, why should people pick you over your competition?</p><p> Even despite that win-win scenario, many firms still worry about being of too &ldquo;picky&rdquo; or exclusionary. Why?</p><p> Focusing on the needs, issues, problems and preferences of a few specific client types cuts against the grain of what many advice businesses believe to be a logical approach. Many believe they should take any business. That logic works if you have a huge automated machine behind you that can handle client after client after client, or the ability to recruit en masse, but that&rsquo;s not how most advice businesses work these days. They have limits, imposed by human capacity for doing the work, seeing the clients and providing the advice.</p><p> As such, this lack of focus on who you want to be advising is one of the main things that holds most back from achieving greater success.</p><p> Identifying your target clientele isn&rsquo;t about saying no to everyone who doesn&rsquo;t meet it. For most firms, that&rsquo;s not a viable immediate option (often for cash flow reasons). However, it is about looking for a competitive advantage that will help you position your firm as experts, communicate more effectively and cut through the noise of the information age.</p><p> It will also help focus you too. It&rsquo;s like when you buy a new car. You notice other new cars just like yours. It&rsquo;s not they weren&rsquo;t there before, just that you only started to notice them once your conscious mind was drawn to pay attention to them.</p><p> Being specific and understanding the deep nature of your clientele is also about getting closer to the clients who represent the future of your business. Despite the appeal of the myth of the entrepreneur with the blinding flash of inspiration, most successful firms are built on the foundation of solving pre-existing customer issues or unmet needs. It&rsquo;s generally much easier than trying to convince the world of their need for what you have to offer. To identify those needs though, you need to understand and have insight into them.</p><p> Niche does not have to mean foregoing other clients with immediate effect. It&rsquo;s a campaign, not an irreversible pivot. The outcome, ideally and frequently (if the insight is accurate), is the specialisation ends up being so robust and profitable that the business won&rsquo;t have to concern itself with sales from outside it&rsquo;s 2-3 core niches.</p><p> Isn&rsquo;t that an outcome that most businesses would be happy with?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Since most advisors have no way of knowing why their client is behaving they way they do, they will pick an interpretation&mdash;because that&rsquo;s what our brains do.</p><p> The way we see one another can be irrational, incomplete and inflexible&mdash;and largely automatic. And it is a two-way street: both from an advisor&rsquo;s and a client&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p> Mike has been a successful wholesaler in the Financial Services industry for over 15 years. He had assembled a solid portfolio that he felt was well diversified and positioned for his future goals. But things changed after he was married for a few years. His wife, Abby, started asking him questions about their investments and Mike felt a bit attacked. Additionally, he found himself answering most of her questions with &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way it is&rdquo; or &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just have to trust me because I can&rsquo;t explain it to your required level of detail.&rdquo;</p><p> You might imagine that didn&rsquo;t go over very well with Abby. Mike had to come to terms with admitting that his expertise in this industry did not incorporate every aspect of the financial planning process that his clients (financial advisors) dealt with on a daily basis: cash flow projections, creating objective portfolios and LTC insurance. He realized it was time to hire a financial advisor.</p><p> While Mike had a short list of names, Abby had a healthy skepticism of most financial professionals.</p><h3> Their initial interviews were quite interesting.</h3><p> <br/> The technical competence of an advisor was fairly easy to ascertain. They could tell whether an advisor was intelligent, skilled and effective.</p><p> What was far more difficult to know about an advisor was how they would understand them at a deeper level. As Abby said, &ldquo;We have to be able to connect with this advisor&rdquo;. The advisor Mike and Abby selected used a combination of an objective profile and reflective questions. They could tell he would be able to navigate their differences very effectively and keep each of them happy in their own way!</p><p> In retrospect, what surprised Mike the most was that the financial selection process of their financial advisor was based completely on trust. Both Abby and Mike trusted this advisor to create a unique plan and manage their hard earned money to reach their goals. And to have honest and direct conversations at their annual reviews to be sure they continued on track without unknowingly derailing their efforts.</p><p> Over the ten years of working with this advisor and his team, they have never been disappointed. Each team member has a different personality and area of expertise and addresses both Mike and Abby in a unique way.</p><p> With Mike, it&rsquo;s a combination of light-hearted fun and getting to the bottom line of progressing towards our goals. For Abby, it is about fun and family but equally important are the details and market overviews. Now Mike can rest easy knowing that she is happy getting all that information and he does not have to be accountable for any answers.</p><h3> There are many reasons to hire a financial advisor.</h3><p> <br/> As this couple demonstrated, it was about finding the person whom they could trust to successfully navigate their differences.</p><p> Technical competence is a &ldquo;check-box&rdquo; item in today&rsquo;s world. Digging deep beneath the surface is what most clients really want from their trusted advisors.</p><p> Are you prepared for this  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialdna.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   deeper discovery journey  </a> </u>  with your clients?</p>",

    "title": "20 Ways to Improve Your Performance at Work",
    "link": "20-ways-improve-your-performance-work",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p><strong>Personal and professional development help ward off negative thoughts that prevent us from taking steps towards self-improvement.&nbsp;</strong>We often sit back and wait for an annual performance review to identify areas we need to improve. Position yourself to be accountable, improve your skill set, and continually learn by setting personal benchmarks and reviewing them regularly. Learning leads to a better quality of life, boosts confidence and personal development, and influences our life in a positive way.Here are 20 ways you can take control, improve your reputation and performance at work, and reach new skill levels and professional development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1) Organize &amp; Prioritize</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Create a daily schedule and follow it. Identify the top three or four critical projects that need to be completed. Ensure your task list is manageable, adds value, and benefits your firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2) Stop Multitasking</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Guilty as charged! In the past I&rsquo;ve been a master multitasker, or so I thought. I could answer a phone call, respond to an email, and dabble on a project simultaneously. I was satisfied that I could work on several projects at once. In reality, the quality of my work was compromised. Multitasking lowers IQ, lowers EQ (emotional intelligence), slows you down, increases stress levels, and causes mistakes. Master unitasking instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3) Avoid Distractions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that <strong> focus</strong> is a fundamental quality of productive people? Our brains are wired to work best when we focus on a single task. Practice staying focused and strive to complete one task before diving into another.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4) Manage Interruptions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to minimize or forget how many times we&rsquo;re interrupted during the day. Interruptions can come in all forms: co-workers, bosses, family, etc. Here&rsquo;s a great trick to manage your interruptions. Keep a stack of post it notes or index cards nearby. On the top of each one, write down a person&rsquo;s name who may interrupt you during the day. The next time they stop in and ask, &ldquo;Do you have a minute?&rdquo; say yes, and also talk about the things you&rsquo;ve jotted down on your list for them. Imagine the time you would save if everyone interrupted you once a day to discuss the three or four things they thought of, rather than three or four times a day for one item.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5) Be a Great Finisher</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of us are great starters but we fall short on finishing. Think about how many times you&rsquo;ve started something new: a project, a New Year&rsquo;s resolution, or a letter and end up adding it back on your to-do list. Keep a journal of completed projects and reflect on it to demonstrate your contributions and accomplishments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6) Set Milestones</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The road to completing a big project may seem overwhelming. Don&rsquo;t let that stop you from taking time to celebrate interim achievement. Break large projects into blocks of mini-tasks and set individual success metrics to keep your morale and energy levels high. Record your progress, reward yourself, and share your progression with the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7) Wear the Bosses Shoes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Put yourself in your boss&rsquo;s shoes. Think about the big picture and look at goals from his/her perspective. One of the most effective strategies is to empathize and discover what his/her aspirations are. Ask questions, <strong> &ldquo;What are you looking for in an employee?&rdquo;</strong> or <strong> &ldquo;What skills and qualities does it take to be successful in my position?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8) Get a Mentor/Be a Mentor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Enhance your skills with a mentor. A mentor can offer new insight, perspective, and vision. Working with a mentor will stretch your thinking and supply you with a stream of self-development ideas related to your unique skills and talent. Don&rsquo;t forget that you can gain experience by mentoring someone else and facilitate your own professional growth which will position you as an asset to your firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9) Simply Listen</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Listening is vital to effective communication. Spend time thinking about how you listen. Do you interrupt others? Mature listening skills lead to increased productivity with fewer mistakes, innovative growth, and higher client satisfaction rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10) Aim for Clarity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarity provides confidence. Ask questions if you are not 100 percent sure of your responsibilities. Schedule time quarterly to re-evaluate firm goals, how your responsibilities fulfill those goals, and how you can better partner with team members to reach each goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>11) Research</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take time to research. Don&rsquo;t waste other&rsquo;s time; do your homework before taking on a new task. You&rsquo;ll be better prepared to present strategies to reach each objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>12) Write a Letter to Your Future Self</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Where do you see yourself in 1 year, 3 years, or even 5 years? What will be the same? What will be different? Write a letter to yourself and work hard to become that person.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>13) Identify Your Blind Spots</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Blind spots are areas we are unaware of about ourselves and may cause good intentions to be perceived in a negative way. Blind spots can hold you back and prevent professional development. To identify blind spots you must be willing to look at yourself honestly, ask others for feedback, and be willing to make changes. Reach out to your peers and ask how you are perceived; you may discover behaviors that hinder your influence as well as strengths you&rsquo;re not aware of. View feedback as an asset rather than a judgement; which will allow you to make adjustments to align your reputation with your ideal self.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>14) Simplify Something</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Often we do things because <strong> &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;ve always done it&rdquo; </strong>even if it&rsquo;s complicated or messy. Find something each week to simplify or automate: a difficult system or process, a messy office, daily tasks, or email. Your efficiency will increase by keeping things simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>15) Ask Questions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Constantly challenge yourself by asking, <strong> &ldquo;Is there a more effective way to achieve the same results?&rdquo;</strong> Brainstorm to determine if you are working as efficiently as possible. Always believe that things can be improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>16) Know Your Competition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Know and observe your competition. Identify what they&rsquo;re doing right and use it as a learning opportunity to implement something new at your firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>17) Acknowledge Others</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Help others excel, express gratitude, and give credit where credit is due. You&rsquo;ll be surprised how much encouragement and motivation a simple, <strong> &ldquo;Great job!&rdquo;</strong> provides. Your team is bound to grow and rise together.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>18) Read</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Read at least one personal development or industry related article each day. Start a journal to record your notes, identify what you learned, and determine how you can apply your findings personally or in the workplace. Share your information with others to establish expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>19) Give Yourself Down Time</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Vacation time is critical to professional development. Without it, stress and burn out levels increase and productivity declines. Schedule time away from the office to expand your horizons, re-energize, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>20) Practice Humility</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid self-promotion and practice humility. Encourage team members and hold a high respect for their unique skill set and contributions to success.<strong> Passion is one of the most important drivers of success.</strong>If you don&rsquo;t love what you do, it&rsquo;s difficult to put your best effort forward and perform to the best of your ability. Ensure your values are reflected and respected in your personal and professional life so that you see true meaning in all that you do.</p>",

    "title": "5 Mind Blowing Concepts About Money",
    "link": "5-mind-blowing-concepts-about-money",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Money gets a bad rap from those who consider themselves &ldquo;good people&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; people or downright religious. Yet, secretly most people realize its importance and don&rsquo;t feel so good when lacking in it. In fact, lack of money is tied to extreme stress and tends not to be good for our health.</p><p> Well, I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a little secret. If you simply change your perspective on money&mdash;thinking about it a little differently&mdash;you will begin attracting the amount of money that is exactly right for you.</p><p> The following five characteristics of money should help you do just that.</p><h3> Money is the currency here on Earth</h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s right. Kick and scream all you will. The fact is, money is what buys us necessity&mdash;food, clothing, and shelter. Therefore it is often the foundation upon which we need to plant our feet. Unless you are grounded&mdash;able to provide the basic necessities for you and your family, it will be hard for you to reach your dreams, whether those dreams include helping others or being truly at peace with yourself.</p><h3> Money is gratitude</h3><p> <br/> What?! That&rsquo;s right. View money as a symbolic gesture of gratitude and you will blow away all your personal barriers of attracting it. When we deliver our gifts to the world, the way people say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; is by gladly giving us money. And the more people we have thanking us for our goods and services, the more financial profit we will reap. Most successful products and industries are successful because masses of people buy into what they are selling. True, many of those things are not good for us, yet they have many people thanking them for appealing to and provided our most base needs and wants. But that proves my point. Still, what we need more of is people applying my money-view and delivering goods and services that elevate the spirit of the masses. Up for the task?</p><h3> Money is NOT the root of all evil</h3><p> <br/> If you have been fighting and fleeing money throughout your life chances are it is because you view it as something dangerous, bad, or, essentially, evil.  It is true that people can get money by playing into our most perverse needs and wants and take advantage of those. And people can cheat and steal their way to financial abundance. But money, itself, is not what does that. It is a person following their primitive nature&mdash;their automatic brain. That person sees money as a way to one-up you and others by sitting on top of a heap of greenbacks, which essentially provides them the ultimate protection and security.  But when we act in alignment with our divine nature&mdash;our fearless, spiritually grounded nature&mdash;then evil is not part of the sentence. The root of all evil, in fact, lies within our primitive nature, controlled by our automatic brain. And evil is often the result of our taking action in accordance with its direction. When we are guided to take divinely inspired action, the masses of people thanking us, by giving us money, is hardly evil.</p><h3> Money is not gained by visualization</h3><p> <br/> I am one of the biggest proponents of meditation and guided visualization. The problem, though, is that most people fall into the trap of visualizing what money can buy. You may have been told to create a vision board and on it, told to place a picture of your dream job, or your dream car, or whatever. But money is a symbol of gratitude and not a commodity&hellip;not a thing. When viewed as gratitude the amount of money we receive will be exactly the amount that is right for us and in synch with the value we bring to people. That in turn will deliver the car that is right for you or the house that is right for you or maybe the boat that is right for you. But receive money to buy these things, you must first visualize yourself in the act of delivering your gift to the most people in the most genuine, valuable way.</p><h3> Money doesn&rsquo;t cause happiness</h3><p> <br/> The temptation is to look at those with money and think they have it made, knowing little about their life story; their challenges. You may think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take their challenges, just give me their kind of money!&rdquo; Be careful what you wish for. What causes happiness is not the money itself, but the process of making money. When your intentions are pure, so too will be your success. When you make the right choices, for the right reasons, the right things will happen. If you are truly applying your gifts and sharing those gifts with good intent for the right reasons, then happiness will result and money will follow.</p><p> Simply tweaking your view of money will help thrust you into targeted action as you apply your gifts, talents, and strengths to help as many people as you can. And in return, expect a big dose of gratitude in the form of money.</p>",

As the company grows, the demands on its leaders from internal and external stakeholders will change and increase, meaning there will be less percentage of their time to go around. It&rsquo;s part of the evolution of an organization.</p><li> &ldquo;How do we ensure the new people hired will feel part of the &lsquo;family&rsquo; culture, reinforcing current values?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Consideration: </strong>  Ensure our hiring process is thorough and complete. Consider doubling the usual time spent with each prospective new &lsquo;family member&rsquo; so that we get to know him or her before we hire. Ensure our on-boarding process and orientation lasts for 6 to 9 months as we welcome/integrate new hires.</p><li> &ldquo;How do we ensure our tenured people welcome new people into the &lsquo;family,&rsquo; rather than become jealous and threatened?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Consideration: </strong>  Engage current &ldquo;family&rdquo; members in all aspects of the hiring and integration process so they get to know each candidate and have a stake in whom is hired and how he or she is on-boarded.</p><p> Alexander Graham Bell once said, &ldquo;Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.&rdquo; Great leaders: take time to examine where you are and where you want to be, then chart your course for success.</p><p> The choice is yours!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SHIFTcomm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Leslie Grant  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.shiftcomm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Shift Communications  </u> </a></p><p> In the world of PR, landing client coverage in publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg Businessweek is the ultimate win &mdash; and when that story runs in print, it&rsquo;s icing on the cake. You probably know that securing coverage in a business publication is no easy feat, especially if you work with startups. So, here are some of my top tips for working with business press.</p><h3> Give them something unique.</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t rely on basic corporate announcements or product launches. The best story for business press is completely unique and interesting to a broad audience. Is your client developing a new product within a budding industry? Support your pitch with examples of other companies in the ecosystem, ideally complementary versus competitive, to give it more weight and demonstrate the broader impact (e.g.,  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/virtual-reality-tools-will-redefine-remote-work-1431299263\" target=\"_blank\">  The Future of Remote Work Feels Like Teleportation </a> ). Got a cool customer story? Consider testing the story on your friends first to see if it&rsquo;s actually cool. Improving ROI by X percent is great, but business reporters are more interested in how people are using technology in unique and unprecedented ways (e.g.,  <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/10/27/357647182/the-red-cross-is-using-text-messaging-to-take-down-ebola\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Red Cross Is Using Text Messaging To Take Down Ebola </a> ).</p><h3> Focus on relationship building.</h3><p> <br/> Understanding that it&rsquo;s not every day your client&rsquo;s technology is being used to save the world (sigh), it often helps to approach business press from more of a relationship building perspective, without the pressure or expectation of immediate coverage. After getting your client&rsquo;s buy-in, start the relationship building process by inviting the reporter to lunch or drinks with the company&rsquo;s CEO (a new, trendy restaurant always helps!). Still give them all the elements that would make for a good story, but also make sure the reporter understands how your client can be a resource, and that the CEO is prepared to talk about the broader industry landscape in addition to his or her own company. Reporters value relationships that are mutually beneficial. They also value direct access, so when it makes sense, have the CEO send the follow-up note. It will go a long way!</p><h3> Be prepared. (And patient!)</h3><p> <br/> Once the reporter expresses interest in actually writing a story, congratulations &mdash; you&rsquo;re halfway there! At this point in the process, they&rsquo;re going to want executive and customer interviews, hands-on product demos, etc. &ndash; anything that will help them bring life to the story. So, be prepared to pull together all of the elements they need, and in a timely fashion. If your story isn&rsquo;t time sensitive, it can easily get lost amidst a slew of other news assignments, so it&rsquo;s on you to keep the ball rolling. That said, also keep in mind that this could, and likely will, be a long process &ndash; months long. After all, the best stories don&rsquo;t happen overnight! With business press, be prepared and be patient, and make sure you&rsquo;re doing everything you can to keep the opportunity alive.</p>",

For starters, it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s busiest airport in terms of international passengers; in 2014 it served nearly 70 million travelers from abroad, surpassing London Heathrow&rsquo;s 68 million. Dubai Duty Free, which operates out of DXB, is the most successful airport retailer in the world, generating sales of $1.8 billion in 2013 alone. And when Terminal 3 was completed in 2008, it was the world&rsquo;s largest building at 18.4 million square feet, an honor it held until 2013 when the New Century Global Center in Chengdu, China was built.<img alt=\"Los Angeles International Airport\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/los-angeles-international-airport-052015.jpg\"/><h3> 5. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)</h3>No. of Passengers (2014): 70.6 millionOwner/Operator: City of Los Angeles/Los Angeles World AirportsNot only is LAX the fifth-busiest airport in the world, but it&rsquo;s also the busiest origin and destination airport. This means that, relative to other airports, many more travelers begin or end their trips in Los Angeles than use it as a connection. With a 6-percent year-over-year increase in passengers between 2013 and 2014, LAX has one of the strongest traffic growth rates in the world.<img alt=\"Haneda International Airport\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/haneda-international-airport-052015.jpg\"/><h3> 4. Haneda International Airport (HND)</h3>No. of Passengers (2014): 72.8 millionOperators: Japan Civil Aviation Bureau, Japan Airport Terminal Co., Tokyo International Air Terminal Corp.Also known as Tokyo International, Haneda Airport is the second-busiest in Asia, able to handle 90 million passengers a year. It might soon reach that level, as it saw a remarkable 5.7-percent year-over-year growth in passenger traffic between 2013 and 2014. Having won the bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics, the Japanese government plans to increase airport capacity even further. Haneda is the primary base for Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, among others.<img alt=\"London Heathrow Airport\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/london-heathrow-airport-052015.jpg\"/><h3> 3. London Heathrow Airport (LHR)</h3>No. of Passengers (2014): 73.4 millionOwner/Operator: Heathrow Airport Holdings/Heathrow Airport LimitedFor years, London Heathrow was the world&rsquo;s busiest airport in terms of international passenger traffic, a distinction that Dubai International finally claimed last year. Serving 185 destinations in 84 countries on 80 different airlines, the British airport sees a high rate of international travelers&mdash;93 percent in 2014. Formerly called London Airport, it received the name &ldquo;Heathrow&rdquo; in 1966, after the medieval hamlet that was demolished in 1944 to make room for the airport.<img alt=\"London Heathrow Airport\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/beijing-capital-international-airport-052015.jpg\"/><h3> 2. Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK)</h3>No. of Passengers (2014): 86.1 millionOperator: Beijing Capital International Airport Company LimitedBeijing Capital is easily Asia&rsquo;s busiest airport, serving 13 million more people than Tokyo International in 2014. To prepare for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing Capital added the mammoth Terminal 3, currently the sixth-largest building in the world. The airport serves as the main hub for Air China, which flies out of Beijing to more than 120 destinations.<img alt=\"Hartfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/hartsfield-jackson-atlanta-airport-052015.jpg\"/><h3> 1. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)</h3>No. of Passengers (2014): 96.1 millionOwner/Operator: City of Atlanta/Atlanta Department of AviationAlmost 100 million domestic and international flyers passed through Atlanta last year. Opened in September 1980, Hartsfield-Jackson has remained the world&rsquo;s busiest passenger airport since 1998; in terms of takeoffs and landings, it&rsquo;s the second-busiest. Contributing to the airport&rsquo;s prominence is Atlanta&rsquo;s convenient location, a mere two-hour flight from 80 percent of the U.S. population. With Hartfield-Jackson as its main hub, Delta currently operates nonstop flights to more than 150 cities, 62 of those being international destinations in 42 countries.Tell us what you think!",

    "link": "11-things-you-learn-your-first-year-as-an-entrepreneur",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I officially launched my business on April 30, 2014.  It's just been over a full year and I already feel like I&rsquo;m dripping with wisdom that only comes from first-hand experience.  I&rsquo;m a work in progress, as most of us are, and while I certainly don&rsquo;t have all the answers, I thought what better time to reflect on the last eight months than right now before we start a new year.  We can all learn a thing or two from each other and if you are thinking about starting your own business or you&rsquo;re walking the path right now &ndash; I hope you find my musings both valuable and encouraging.</p><h3> 1. It&rsquo;s scary &ndash; like jumping out of an airplane scary</h3><p> <br/> Look before you leap helps, but you still have to leap.  Jumping into a self-employed career is scary, because you are solely relying on yourself to succeed.  It&rsquo;s a risk to follow an idea into actuality and you can&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know.  There are a lot of unknowns and your livelihood depends on it &ndash; no pressure.  That being said, that first step is the scariest and then you find the ride is exciting, fun and rejuvenating. You somehow get over being scared and make the decision that total failure isn&rsquo;t an option, that you will land on your feet ready to run harder and faster than you&rsquo;ve ever run before.</p><h3> 2. You&rsquo;ll never work harder for a dollar in your life</h3><p> <br/> Any entrepreneur will tell you that it&rsquo;s hard work.  &ldquo;If it were easy, everyone would do it.&rdquo; Remember?  Whether you have a product or a service you&rsquo;re trying to sell, you need to hustle and I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;do the best you can&rdquo; kind of hustle.  I mean &ldquo;Holy shit! My ass is on fire and I need to find water&rdquo; kind of hustle.  If you&rsquo;re like me, you went from a 9-5 type job where you were responsible for your function to a 24/7 blitzkrieg where you are responsible for everything from operations, business development, marketing, sales, and customer service to accounting (the list goes on).  Then, when you do finally receive your first payment, you wipe the sweat off your brow and say, &ldquo;Holy shit! My ass is still on fire!&rdquo; And so it goes for a while&hellip; but don&rsquo;t worry, you can do it.</p><h3> 3. If you wait for perfect, you&rsquo;ll die waiting</h3><p> <br/> I work with many entrepreneurs and start-ups, so I know I&rsquo;m not alone in having felt this way.  Many of us drag our feet to make our websites go live or announce our business on social media and to family and friends, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s not perfect yet.&rdquo;  Allow me to save you some time: It&rsquo;s not perfect; it&rsquo;s never going to be perfect; and no one cares but you.  Obviously, don&rsquo;t put garbage out there, but my point is that you will learn very quickly what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not working only AFTER you start putting yourself out there and receiving feedback.  We learn when we do.  It&rsquo;s 1000% OK to make the necessary adjustments as you go, but if you think perfect is the prerequisite to begin your business &ndash; then you may actually never begin.</p><h3> 4. Failure is your friend</h3><p> <br/> While total failure isn&rsquo;t a friend I want, failures are a natural part of the journey.  We all stumble and make mistakes.  Fortunately, when we can learn from our failures is when we really grow and succeed.  As I mentioned earlier, we can&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know.   Therefore, we sometimes walk ourselves right into a humdinger of a situation.  Hindsight is always 20/20 and we can find ourselves in the face-palm position a lot in the beginning screaming, &ldquo;That was such a stupid mistake I made; I know better!&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Holy shit! My ass is still on fire!&rdquo;  My point: you don&rsquo;t have time to throw yourself a pity party and no one likes a man or woman-baby.  Yes, we make mistakes.  Yes, we fail.  Got it? Ok, good.  Now let&rsquo;s move on smarter than when we started.</p><h3> 5. Hermits don&rsquo;t prosper</h3><p> <br/> I think we can all agree that relationships fuel growth.  Building good relationships takes time and vulnerability, but it&rsquo;s worth every second.  Once you go out on your own, you may find that you feel lonely or even isolated.  You may not be working in a bustling office with coworkers anymore.  The days that may have been peppered with social escapes are gone and now it&rsquo;s you and your business.  I have found immeasurable value in my online and offline communities.  I make it a high priority to connect with people and to stay connected.  As an entrepreneur, hiding away in the shadows is really not going to serve you or your business objectives.  As a budding entrepreneur, make sure you&rsquo;re getting out there, meeting people, building bridges and planting seeds.  As far as you think you may be able to take your business, it&rsquo;s nothing compared to the potential opportunities out there.</p><h3> 6. Surrounding yourself with people smarter than you, does make you smarter</h3><p> <br/> This one is pretty self-explanatory. You NEED people in your life that know more than you.  They will challenge you, test you, and grow you more than you can ever grow on your own.  I had the good fortune of being invited into a women&rsquo;s entrepreneur mastermind group.  Once a month, we still get together with five other entrepreneurs and share one problem or scenario with the group to receive feedback.  In fact, I joined the group back when I had what we all laughed was a &ldquo;secret business,&rdquo; because I hadn&rsquo;t officially launched my site yet (refer back to #1 and #3!) After one session with five other people who had been where I was and who gave me the swift kick in the ass I needed to get off my laurels and buck-up, I announced my business 24-hours later.  That&rsquo;s what the power of surrounding yourself with smarter people than you can do.  It can turn inaction into action, offer life perspective for your ears only, and build you up from the inside out.  If you want to succeed as an entrepreneur, surround yourself with successful entrepreneurs.  We is greater than me.</p><h3> 7.  The word &ldquo;No&rdquo; holds a special place in your heart</h3><p> <br/> This is a word I struggled with &ndash; still wrestle with every now and again.  It is such a powerful word and one that isn&rsquo;t the easiest to say and is especially hard to hear when you&rsquo;re trying to get your business going.  Though, over these last eight months of building my business, I&rsquo;ve really come to appreciate the word, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  No one is looking out for your business&rsquo; best interests besides you.  Therefore, you need to be extra keen to make smart decisions for your business and its future.  The truth is, not everyone is an ideal client for your business and not every opportunity that presents itself is the right opportunity for you.  As an entrepreneur, you need to be both comfortable saying the word, &ldquo;No&rdquo; and hearing it from others.  Being told, &ldquo;No&rdquo; by a client you think would be great or an opportunity you really wanted is not pleasant, but it&rsquo;s the natural course of things.  If you&rsquo;re doing it right, you&rsquo;ll probably face your fair share of rejection &ndash; but keep at it and learn how to turn, &ldquo;No&rdquo; into &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><h3> 8. No matter how good you are, you have to be an even stronger negotiator and salesperson</h3><p> <br/> Ah, yes.  Sharpen your tools folks, because you need to learn how to negotiate and sell.  I&rsquo;ve done more negotiating and selling in these last eight months than I probably did my entire life leading up to this point.  You will be negotiating with EVERYONE: your loved-ones, the bank, vendors, customers, partners, EVERYONE.  This is also where #7 plays a big role, too.  As an entrepreneur, you are a salesperson: you need to be able to sell yourself, business, service or product.  Communicating clearly and knowing how to highlight the value to the listener is a must-have skill set.  If you&rsquo;re weak in these areas, you will learn the hard way pretty quickly&hellip;</p><h3> 9. Eat a slice of humble pie every day &ndash; it&rsquo;s good for the soul</h3><p> <br/> Two of the most insightful things you discover when you launch your own business is 1. How flawed you are; and 2. How much support you have anyway.  I have seen the ugliest parts of myself through this process and what a blessing it has been.  We all have demons and there are obviously things about every one of us that can hinder our ability to succeed.   Being aware of our shortcomings helps us to overcome them.  Having a support system of people who love us in spite of our flaws and who believe in us keeps us grounded.  I&rsquo;m a confident and capable person, but try to remember on a daily basis that it&rsquo;s not all about me and I have a lot of gratitude to give to others.  Make sure you remember that, too.</p><h3> 10. Always keep learning</h3><p> <br/> Learning is never finished.  There is always something new to know, a skill to develop or a technology to implement.  The world changes quickly and so being nimble, adaptable, and always seeking knowledge is a pretty necessary entrepreneurial quality you realize you need right away.</p><h3> 11. It is a very rewarding path</h3><p> <br/> Despite the challenges every entrepreneur faces, it is quite simply the most rewarding choice I have ever made for my career.  I am able to spend every day helping people by doing exactly what I love.  When you follow your passion and are able to make a living at it &ndash; I really can&rsquo;t imagine a more harmonized life.  It&rsquo;s an amazing journey I would want for anyone who wants it for himself.</p><p> Have any insights of your own?!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIJohnA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Anderson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://www.seic.com/enUS/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SEI   </u> </a></p><p> In EY&rsquo;s 2014 wealth management survey  <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY_-_Closing_the_gap:_2014_Wealth_Management_Survey/$File/EY-Wealth-Management-Survey.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Closing the Gap  </u>  ,&rdquo; </a>  the authors suggested that while &ldquo;holistic goals-based planning&rdquo; ranked  as the number one trend influencing where clients invest today, the key factors of where clients actually did invest were based more on firm/advisor reputation, experience around servicing similar clients, and in some cases, the depth of the advisors&rsquo; product set. The authors suggested that while goals-based planning is important, the clients are not seeing any real differences in the offerings from wealth management firms. It is also interesting to note that advisors felt that their goals-based offering was the second most important reason that clients hired them. Talk about a disconnect!</p><h3> It is always about fees and value</h3><p> <br/> Since the release of our white paper, &ldquo; <u>  Next Wave of Financial Planning, </u> &rdquo; I have spent a lot of time debating (defending?) one of our major premises: fees are coming to a fork in the road. Our paper suggests that more educated clients, clients looking for transparency, direct to fund companies (and custodians), and even robo-advisors are going to push fees more out in the open and advisors will have to evolve their pricing structure or develop a stronger value proposition to justify their worth.</p><p> My colleague and co-author, Raef Lee, suggests that this trend is coming, but will not happen until consumers really begin to push. My belief is that the groundswell is happening now &ndash; and over the next few years, it will really hit full force. No matter who is right in this discussion (I am), we both believe that it is important for advisors to develop a more clear value proposition and really differentiate themselves and their firms around planning. It is clear that clients want holistic planning, but how do you show real value and justify your fees for something that happens over 10-30 years of planning?</p><h3> Looking at it from both sides</h3><p> <br/> When I think of my own experience with financial plans, I think I can empathize with both advisors and their clients. In fact, I may be in a unique position to look at both sides. As a financial service professional with almost 30 years of experience, I know the hard work, hours, and  attention to detail that&rsquo;s put into a plan. I see advisors using technology to review assumptions, monitor accounts, and educate themselves so that they can be prepared for investment trends or estate and tax law changes that will affect their clients&rsquo; lives.</p><p> As a 50+ year old father of two who is concerned about sending our kids to college, funding a retirement for my wife and me and fulfilling a few other goals, I can really see the value of our comprehensive plan. Today, I am more organized than ever before and feel confident in the plan. In short, we have peace of mind. But do I value the plan more because I know the work involved?</p><p> How do you communicate or show your value and efforts to all of your clients? Especially when they value the holistic goals-based planning they are not finding out there with your competition?</p><h3> Show them the way</h3><p> <br/> <br/> I&rsquo;ve said it before, but I think it bears repeating. Price is only questioned when value is not perceived. If you have clients who are asking what they are getting for their fees, you need to show them.</p><h3> A couple of ideas for you to consider/implement: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Create a roadmap.  </strong> This tells clients what they can expect from you and your firm. Think about your processes, from discovery/data gathering to implication to service meetings, and map it out on a piece of paper. Show the progress from the early stages of the relationship and what will happen in quarterly or semiannual meetings. Show them how you will evaluate progress (especially progress to goals).</li><li> <strong>  Create a &ldquo;year in the life.&rdquo;  </strong> This takes a little more work, but can really demonstrate your commitment to the client. Take a sheet of paper and write out, by month, all the contacts you will have with that client. In other words, show them what they will experience when working with you. Draw a horizontal line about &frac14; down under the monthly activities and underneath begin to write down all the things you do on behalf of the client. Write down activities like creating consolidated reports, estate plan reviews and beneficiary checkups, regularly scheduled meetings and phone calls with estate and tax professionals. Think about adding portfolio reviews, rebalancing, monthly investment committee meetings and even include preparation for client meetings (and include follow-up). <br/>  </li><p> Clients are asking for goals-based planning, but not finding true differentiation of the services that are out there. To me, it means that we are still not communicating the difference between real planning and investment advice. Real planning takes time, focuses on goals, and reports on progress to goals. It also takes communication of the short term and long term benefits. Can your client clearly articulate your process? Can you show them?</p>",

Anthony Iannarino  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Iannarino  </u> </a></p><p> You need to be prepared to prospect. But not as much as you might think.</p><p> <strong>  The first thing you need to know to begin prospecting is your company&rsquo;s value proposition. </strong></p><li> What problems does your company solve?</li><li> How do you solve those problems?</li><li> What are the three or four main differentiators that allow you to make a difference and that compel your client to choose you over your competitors? <br/>  </li><p> When you can answer these questions, you know enough about your company to begin prospecting.</p><p> <strong>  The second thing you need to know is who your target clients are, your dream clients. </strong></p><li> You need a list of dream clients ( <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4AnOt8RTgaQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Here is a video to help you define dream clients  </a> </u> ). These people or companies are plagued with the kind of problems you solve and will perceive the value in what you sell.</li><li> It&rsquo;s also helpful to know the titles and roles of the people who are going to be most compelled by what you sell, but it isn&rsquo;t absolutely necessary. You can find the contact you need. <br/>  </li><p> You don&rsquo;t need a CIA dossier on your contact before you contact them. You know enough to call.</p><p> <strong>  The third thing you need is a good script (or planned dialogue) that allows you to ask for a meeting while promising to create value for your prospect. </strong></p><li> You need two or three useful insights or ideas that you can share with your dream client so that you can ask for a meeting. This is the value you promise to create (which means your meeting isn&rsquo;t a pitch meeting).</li><li> You also need a list of reasons why people refuse an appointment and good methodology for overcoming objections. <br/>  </li><h3> A List of Things You Don&rsquo;t Need <br/>  </h3><li> Except in the rarest of cases, you don&rsquo;t need to do hours and hours of research (even though you may need to do more research later, once you&rsquo;ve booked a call). A look at the company&rsquo;s website and the contact&rsquo;s LinkedIn page is smart, but hours of research is call reluctance.</li><li> You don&rsquo;t need a trigger event. You don&rsquo;t need to wait until something is reported in a public source before you call. You want to be there before the trigger event occurs. You want to nurture relationships. When the trigger event occurs, you are already behind where you need to be.</li><li> You don&rsquo;t need to connect on social sites, and you don&rsquo;t need to listen. It&rsquo;s wonderful if you connect with a contact before you pick up the phone and call them. It&rsquo;s even more wonderful if you can pick up some insight that allows you to create value. The telephone is an awesome social tool because it allows you to actually speak with your prospective client across long distances. <br/>  </li><p> There is no formula for success that includes waiting to take action. There is no benefit in doing more than the minimum amount of preparation necessary before prospecting.</p>",

    "link": "whos-ripping-off-your-aging-clients",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Most of us hear about unscrupulous family members taking advantage of their aging parents or grandparents.  And everyone knows that internet scams abound. The one in which the scammer calls an elder and pretends to be a grandchild in trouble is notorious. And unfortunately, successful as it still goes on. Funds from grandma&rsquo;s account get wired to Western Union and the thief disappears.</p><p> Financial elder abuse is rampant. The National Center On Elder Abuse puts the amount stolen from elders each year at $2.9B. But a privately run  <a href=\"https://truelink-wordpress-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/True-Link-Report-On-Elder-Financial-Abuse-012815.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   recent study  </u>    </a> calculated the amount at a shocking $36B+ per year.  Who is doing this to our seniors?</p><p> Family members are the most frequent abusers of elders, because of access, exploiting the relationship of trust, and knowing just how easily manipulated a parent or other loved one can become with aging and dementia.  Family members usually know how much money their parents have and how to get the parent to either give it to them or give them control over it so they can take it without the parent&rsquo;s knowledge. Sadly, we see this often in our consulting work at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.agingparents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingParents.com  </a> </u> .</p><p> Caregivers, who also develop a relationship of trust with their care recipients, have the advantage of being with the elder in unsupervised situations.  Ruthless caregivers get the elder to sign a power of attorney and being dependent on the caregiver, the elder may be fearful and intimidated if she does not acquiesce to the demands of the caregiver.  In one case, a caregiver managed to steal $4M from a 74 year old client with multiple sclerosis who became physically unable to manage for herself.  The caregiver got a power of attorney and opened 67 accounts in eleven banks. One bank finally caught on and reported their suspicions, but it was too late. The caregiver went to jail but the elder died before the criminal&rsquo;s sentencing.</p><p> In spite of the easy access family and caregivers have to seniors,  <strong>  the most dollars are actually stolen from elders every year by professionals. </strong> That includes broker-dealers, insurance sales persons, lawyers and others in a position of both trust and authority to manipulate or outright steal elders&rsquo; funds. About a third of FINRA prosecutions involve elders. There are ripoff artists among us.</p><p> One thing that doesn&rsquo;t seem to change over time is the reality that most cases of elder abuse go unreported to authorities and are therefore never prosecuted. The thieves get away with it. In one case we saw in our office, a 92 year old whose son had power of attorney for her took thousands of dollars from her bank account and refused to account for it. We were involved in helping her change the authority he had over her finances. I spoke with her and described that what her son had done was wrong and was a crime. She knew it was wrong and did not want to take action. Her response: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my son prosecuted&rdquo;.</p><p> Many elders are more frail and less willing to pursue legal remedies than a younger person may be. They suffer from shame, depression and embarrassment that they have been so taken in by anyone. Some just don&rsquo;t have the energy to fight back and the thieves know this. They count on it.</p><p> What can the concerned financial professional do about financial abuse?  There are ways you can be more vigilant and protective of clients than ever.  Here are five things to keep in mind for any aging client.</p><li>  Know that even at the very earliest stages of dementia, a client is likely to be  moderately impaired for making safe financial decisions. Pay attention to their ability or lack of it to understand complex or risky products such as non-traded REITS, which regulators disapprove of selling to seniors.   <strong>  Avoid suggesting or offering any products which require significant analysis by the client if you have even a hint of cognitive decline in that client. </strong></li><li>  Know that  <strong>  age alone is a risk factor for developing dementia </strong>  and its accompanying diminished capacity.  By the time your clients reach age 85, at least a third of them will have Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease or other dementia.  Two out of three persons affected by Alzheimer&rsquo;s are women.   <strong>  Be especially vigilant with your aging female clients. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Know your client. </strong>  If he or she departs from a long standing spending pattern and you suddenly see unexplained large cash withdrawals, be suspicious,  <strong>  ask questions and probe. </strong>  Someone could have gotten control over your client&rsquo;s account.  Don&rsquo;t stand idly by. Get involved and find out.  <strong>  Report abuse if you suspect it. </strong> Take action to stop the abuse. Protect your client.</li><li> If you work in an organization where professional colleagues have aging clients and there is opportunity to either sell them unsuitable investment products or otherwise manipulate these elders, <strong>  lobby your organization for enhanced and more frequent scrutiny of all client accounts for people age 65 and up. </strong> The Federal Government and state laws define an &ldquo;elder&rdquo; as someone 65 and above. Watch those accounts more often and in more detail.</li><li> <strong>  Develop your own best practices, senior-specific policy, in writing. </strong>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/diminishedcapacitywebinar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Training in best practices  </a> </u>  and commitment to your clients&rsquo; safety will enable you to get it right. Once you have a clear policy in place for yourself independently or for your organization, everyone can respond to red flags of diminished capacity and warning signs of elder abuse in a uniform way.  That will enhance your ability to honor your clients so you can protect him from predators.</li>",

    "title": "5 Metrics That Will Increase CEO Interest in the Corporate Blog",
    "link": "5-metrics-that-will-increase-ceo-interest-in-the-corporate-blog",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> CEOs are notoriously numbers driven. They care about numbers and results, not editorial schedules and topic brainstorms. And the only thing the want to know about the corporate blog is that it drives growth in reach, conversions, and the bottom line.</p><p> As a marketer, it&rsquo;s up to you to translate the performance of the corporate blog into data that the CEO actually cares about. Fortunately, more and more of these useful metrics come to light as marketing technology develops. This makes it easier for you to do your job and report on it in a digestible way to the people who matter.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a look at five metrics you can use to translate the performance of your corporate blog into real value for your CEO or C-Suite.</p><h3> 1. Overall Reach Metrics</h3><p> Overall reach metrics such as visitors, downloads, and page views can be success indicators to use when talking to your CEO about the corporate blog, but they have to be put into context.</p><p> Compare these metrics in terms of a trade show or live marketing event. How much do you invest in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/brilliant-trade-show-exhibit-ideas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reaching 500 target customers at an in-person event  </a> </u> ? Then compare that rate to the cost of maintaining a blog that reaches 500 target customers per month (or more). Using these numbers to directly compare the reach of your corporate blog will clearly articulate the value to your CEO.</p><h3> 2. Networking Reach Metrics</h3><p> Beyond the overall reach of your blog, you should also report on how your blog receives is found. Report referrals, inbound links from other websites and visits from search engines as evidence that your corporate blog efforts are attracting new visitors, existing customers or curious journalists.</p><p> You can also compare your website traffic to your competitors using Alexa.com. While this number is a ranking and is not exact, it can help to clue your CEO in on the impact your blog has on closing competitive awareness gaps or widening a competitive advantage.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-measurement/6-critically-undervalued-social-media-success-metrics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Convince and Convert  </a> </u>  cites Open Site Explorer as a useful tool for tracking and reporting on this information.</p><h3> 3. Lead Generation Metrics</h3><p> Lead generation metrics are more closely tied to the bottom line than website visitors, so they&rsquo;re much more interesting to your C-Suite. Report on form completion data you&rsquo;re gathering through your blog and content efforts from call-to-actions, landing pages and contact forms, then report on the percentage of those leads that sales deems &ldquo;prospects.&rdquo;</p><p> This will help your CEO clearly see the impact your corporate blog has on generating sales opportunities for your company.</p><h3> 4. Lifelong Email List Metrics</h3><p> Beyond initial lead generation, take a look at your email list metrics to consider which email newsletter campaigns or types appeal to subscribers and existing customers that have been on your list for a long period of time. These are customers who have signed up to stay connected with your company in the long run to keep updated with what you&rsquo;re doing and gain a competitive edge using your insights. </p><p> These customers are often more valuable because they are invested in a long-term, loyal relationship. By tracking this information (such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zettasphere.com/9-experts-weigh-in-on-email-metrics-that-matter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   revenue per 1,000 emails sent  </a> </u> ), you can arrive at a figure that represents the value of these long-term email newsletter subscribers.</p><h3> 5. Sales Generation Metrics</h3><p> Obviously your CEO is interested in sales that are directly attributed to the corporate blog. Since your blog is a gateway for people finding your website, you&rsquo;ll find that some of people that read your blog and become leads also become customers.</p><p> Because the B2B sales cycle isn&rsquo;t immediate, having a CRM in place to follow people who found your blog through the customer journey is critical to showing sales generation metrics to your CEO. However, include this number in the context of these other metrics to show that much of your corporate blog efforts are investments in relationships that lead to future business, not immediate payouts.</p><p> Your corporate blog is a valuable resource for driving business growth and development over time. Show your CEO the company blog&rsquo;s value by reporting on these metrics on a regular basis. Don&rsquo;t let the lack of data doom your hard work planning and writing your blog. Translate your blog performance into real numbers and data to validate your efforts and increase understanding in the C-Suite.</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>",

    "content": "<p> Have you seen the new Bank of America/Merrill and UBS Wealth Management ads? They&rsquo;ve painted a lovely picture of themselves as people you can trust to talk about financial life management, helping consumers understand financial trade-offs and the general business of specific financial advice.</p><p> Wait! Aren&rsquo;t these the same firms that have been steadily paying fines for fraud, bonus settlement schemes and victimizing millions of homeowners? Aren&rsquo;t they the guys who have been fined billions for helping clients evade taxes and creating an alternative trading system that screwed investors to a never-before-seen magnitude?</p><p> Now, they&rsquo;ve decided to take their show to consumers to show them how to manage their financial life? When I saw the first commercial, I thought I must be hallucinating! They actually believe that consumers will be so easily fooled. They believe their customers will listen with rapt attention to their questionably trained advisors who reap commission from their &ldquo;advice&rdquo; (and who, by the way, do not adhere to the Fiduciary Standard requiring them to act in the clients&rsquo; best interest). Surely no one will fall for that? Will they?</p><p> But there they are&mdash;star-studded television ads, slickly written by pros that know all the &ldquo;right&rdquo; words to silkily woo the unsuspecting consumer. These messages are seeping into your system. They are setting the stage to draw your attention to these massive firms and squeeze out whatever more they can from unsuspecting consumers.</p><p> We read or watch the news. We see the fines and penalties imposed on these companies for grievous misdeeds foisted upon investors and consumers. Isn&rsquo;t it the ultimate chutzpah for these firms to now portray themselves as the appropriate place for consumers to seek real, meaningful and objective advice?</p><p> I am not saying these firms are incapable&mdash;I&rsquo;m saying approach anything they originate with extreme caution and skepticism. Why trust your life-shaping decisions with firms that have no culture or experience in acting in your best interest? Remember the old parable about the Scorpion and the Frog? ( <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog%20\" target=\"_blank\">   Click Here  </a> </u> ) Don&rsquo;t be the frog.</p><p> Appropriate Financial Planning is all about relationships, caring, expertise, time, patience, understanding, analysis, discussion and education&mdash;all wrapped in a neat bow guided by the highest standard of care for the clients&rsquo; success and well-being.</p><p> <strong>  The big financial institutions can show you pictures of happy families and advisors being invited to graduation parties and long walks on the beach. </strong> But it&rsquo;s all fiction. Just like their puny defenses before the billions in penalties awarded to victims, the Judicial Systems and the SEC. The wise consumer follows the adage <strong>  &ldquo;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.&rdquo; </strong> Don&rsquo;t fall for their pretty pictures.</p><p> Your financial and life success should not be left up to chance. Or up to a salesman in a fancy suit in a fancy office that produces lots of fancy commercials. No, <strong>  you want an advisor with the skills, experience, culture, reputation, training, certifications and proven commitment to help people successfully. </strong> If you can&rsquo;t find it in those tall steel towers, do some research and look for advisors who walk their talk, who have clear unblemished records, proven experience and a deep driving passion to help their clients succeed.</p><p> Make sure their responsibility&mdash;in writing&mdash;is to you and you alone. Make sure that they live and uphold the fiduciary standard. There is simply no substitute for the comfort you get when you are dealing with ethical, straightforward and experienced planners.</p><p> Final word to the wise: <strong>  stay away from sweet-talking scorpions. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> A few years ago a colleague of mine nominated me for an HR Leadership Award for Greater Washington.  I was really honored and thought we&rsquo;d have a lot of fun hanging out at the receptions, doing some networking and attending the awards dinner together. </p><p> When they called out my name as a winner in the Emerging HR Leader category I was really excited.  I walked up to the stage to get my award and had my picture taken with the other winners and presenters. It was a great night. </p><p> Unfortunately, one of my memories that is still sticking around from that experience is of the picture, where we&rsquo;re all smiling, and I look fat.  Flaws or fabulousness, I think you can tell what I was noticing.  </p><h3> What Do You Notice? Flaws or Fabulousness?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  When your child asks:  </strong>  Are you proud I cleaned up my room? </p><p> Do you respond:  Yes, but I think you could have done better.  </p><p> <strong>  When your spouse asks: </strong>  Do you love my manicure? </p><p> Do you respond:  It&rsquo;s nice, but did they mean to only paint half of your pinky? </p><p> <strong>  When your friend asks:  </strong> Great shirt! Where did you it? </p><p> Do you respond:  I like it too, but it&rsquo;s already starting to fall apart.  </p><p> <strong>  When your boss asks:  </strong> How&rsquo;s the team doing? </p><p> Do you respond:  Good, but we&rsquo;re still working on improving our results.  </p><p> <strong>  When your team member asks:  </strong> Are you happy with the edits? </p><p> Do you respond:  It&rsquo;s better, but I&rsquo;ll take it from here.  </p><p> <strong>  When your colleague asks:  </strong> Will you be attending the annual conference? </p><p> Do you respond:  I thought about it, but I hate the location.  </p><h3> How Can You Focus Less on Flaws and Embrace More Fabulousness?</h3><h3> <br/> Language: </h3><p> All of the responses above have a word that shuts out true positivity and brings on the flaws:  <strong>  but. </strong>  But dismisses, qualifies and belittles everything that you say immediately prior.  The next time you&rsquo;re tempted to qualify your statement with a &ldquo;but,&rdquo; bring on an &ldquo;and.&rdquo;  Even if &ldquo;Yes and&rdquo; is not new to you, use this as a reminder to  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/watch-your-language/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   bring conscious awareness to the words you&rsquo;re using  </u>  . </a></p><p> Yes AND  </p><p> &gt; builds on possibilities </p><p> &gt; celebrates accomplishments </p><p> &gt; puts aside judgment in favor of appreciation </p><h3> Gratitude:</h3><p> When you&rsquo;re feeling in the dumps, hyper critical of yourself and others,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/self-pity-find-gratitude/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   gratitude is the way  </a> </u>  to ditch the stress and embrace the goodness that&rsquo;s present, yet remains hidden.   </p><h3> Intention: </h3><p> This one is really easy to say and a little harder to do: Look for the good.  As humans, we&rsquo;re often drawn towards the dark side.  Flaws leap in our face and fabulousness may be hidden beneath the surface.  A little like Where&rsquo;s Waldo, you need to know where to look and keep looking until you find it.  </p><h3> Choose Your Mindset: </h3><p> Nobody forces you to see a fat person when you want to see the smiles.  As humans,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/change-life-change-story/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   we have the power to change our lives and thoughts  </a> </u> . Carol Dweck&rsquo;s research tells us that awareness of when we&rsquo;re slipping into a fixed mindset (nothing will change, this is as good as it gets) can be a trigger to instead choose a growth mindset. </p><h3> Be Aware of Cognitive Dissonance:</h3><p> Cognitive Dissonance is holding two contradictory thoughts at the same time.   When you&rsquo;re feeling anxiety, do you look for reasons to justify your feeling?  Of course you do, yet it does not make those reasons true&hellip;. they&rsquo;re justifications to relieve your mental stress.  </p><h3> Read Your Inner Subtitles:</h3><p> Imagine that you were able to watch a replay of your last hour back on TV &ndash; with subtitles to share your inner thoughts.  Those inner thoughts are often more telling than the words you speak.  </p><p> You may say: Everything&rsquo;s good.  </p><p> You may be thinking: Don&rsquo;t look too closely. </p><p> Catch yourself and change your inner dialog. </p><h3> Tell Your Saboteur to Take a Hike</h3><p> Is your saboteur blocking you from the light and pointing you towards all of the flaws in your life and leadership?  The saboteur in all of us is often described like a  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leadership-mindset-create-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  devil on your shoulder </a> .  Are you stressed out that your saboteur may be right? </p><p> Do this NOW: Tell your saboteur to leave you the *bleep* alone.  Tell your saboteur to pack their bags, move on out.  It sounds silly, but it actually works to free up some positivity and fresh thinking.  </p><p> Flaws or fabulousness come down to your way of seeing the world.  Your perspective.  <strong>  Taking intentional actions to shift your way of seeing will also shift your way of being. What you notice is up to you. </strong></p>",

Oh and there&rsquo;s that book/training/workshop/speech/webinar you&rsquo;ve been jonesing to develop but keep putting off. Where would you find the time?</p><p> So here you are. Working like a mad man/mad woman but not feeling it. You&rsquo;d give anything to feel the love again.</p><p> You need the secret weapon.</p><p> So here it is:</p><p>      Ask yourself this one question:  <strong>  What lights you up?  </strong></p><p>      And once you know the answer:  <strong>  Do more of it. </strong></p><p> Before you say well &ldquo;duh&rdquo;, work with me a little.</p><p> It&rsquo;s like cleaning your closet. You decide what you really love and can&rsquo;t wait to wear and you consign the rest to someone who will love it more.</p><p> But most people don&rsquo;t clear their closet until they absolutely have to. They wait until their stuff has overwhelmed the space and they can&rsquo;t close the door.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t wait for the implosion.</p><p> My client &ldquo;Jason&rdquo; has a delightfully simple approach to this. If it&rsquo;s not directly related to his zone of genius, he finds someone else to do it. He&rsquo;s built a hugely successful business applying his philosophy to every aspect of his work (and life) and he&rsquo;s one of the happiest people I know.</p><p> In my own case, I&rsquo;m in flow mode whenever I&rsquo;m planning something complex (strategy) or creating original content. But once I&rsquo;ve planned or written or filmed it, I&rsquo;m ready to hand it off. One of my best decisions EVER was finding the right VA who happily takes this off my hands (and reminds me to keep at it when I falter).</p><p> So. What lights YOU up?</p><p> I challenge you to whip out your phone or a piece of paper right now and jot down five things that light you up. Got it?</p><p> Now next to each one, come up with one thing&mdash;just one thing&mdash;that you can do to get yourself more of that right now.</p><p>      Like this: I want to create content for my ideal audience&mdash;I will reserve every                Friday afternoon to write, phones and email OFF.</p><p>      Or this: I do my best work when collaborating&mdash;I will source three potential new          colleagues to help with my assignments.</p><p>      And this: Leading group workshops makes my heart beat faster&mdash;I will network          with my tribe and uncover speaking opportunities where I can pitch my talents.</p><p> You have the ability to make small&mdash;and even crazy big&mdash;changes when it frees you to do the work you were born to do.</p><p> What lights you up? Do more of THAT.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Sometimes a \"no thanks\" is an opportunity to build trust</h3><p> <br/> In a consultative sales environment it is important to manage expectations and to understand that the sale will happen on your prospect's terms and not when you want it to happen. This is true in pretty much any sales situation but it is essential in a long-term sales prospecting scenario.</p><p> No is the second best answer when you prospect new business.</p><h3> Why is no thanks the second best answer?</h3><p> <br/> Because it can help you build trust and it will assist you in opening a dialogue with the prospect where you can be of assistance and add value.</p><p> Let's paint a scenario. You are selling a software that enables clients to streamline workflow. Your prospect responds to your outreach saying that they are not interested in a conversation right now because they already work with a trusted company. This is your opportunity to congratulate your prospect on the fact that they already work with a company that helps them in that area and it is an opportunity to ask for permission to reach out again. Should they agree (and in 90% of the cases they do), make it your goal for the next three to  six months to arm your prospect with information about your company and your service offering. Don't just call back, checking the pulse and trying to get another meeting. This is your chance to build a relationship and trust.</p><h3> Seize the opportunity to educate your prospect</h3><p> <br/> You can send your prospect relevant information on your company, such as case studies. Or, whenever you come across information that might be relevant to your prospect, such as media coverage on your company or news on developments relating to the prospect, make a phone call or send an email.</p><p> Add value in your communication and be personal. Weave in personal messages as long as they are relevant. If you know that your prospect is a football fan, you can reach out when their favorite team plays the Superbowl. Set up Google Alerts on the company and make references to developments. The most important thing is to be authentic and not \"salesy\".  As long as you come from a place of integrity and authenticity you will be successful in building a trusting relationship.</p><h3> Build Trust</h3><p> <br/> This doesn't mean that you will win the contract when it is up for renewal, but it will certainly increase your chances to be considered. People like to work with people that they know and trust. But trust is something that needs to be built, it doesn't happen overnight. Many sales people make the mistake of only communicating with their prospects when they feel that a sale could be made. From a prospect perspective it doesn't feel genuine . When you show interest in your prospect during times where no sale can be made, that's your chance to turn a No into a Maybe and eventually into a Yes (if there is a fit). During the times where you build your relationship you can also gain valuable insights on your prospect's needs, such as their role within the organization, who they report to, what their budget is and so much more.</p><h3> When does a No really mean No?</h3><p> <br/> When you are not targeting the right person within the organization or there isn't a fit.  It is key for you to find out if the solution/product that you are offering is something the decision maker you are targeting is interested in and/or authorized to buy AND that the solution will add value. If there is no fit, it's better to move on, gracefully.</p><p> The lesson to be learned is that a No doesn't necessarily mean that your prospect will never buy from you. All it means that the timing wasn't right or the circumstances didn't align. The key is to target the right person within the organization and to understand their needs and objectives. Time will work in your favor as long as you are professional, mindful and consultative.</p>",

    "link": "entrepreneurs-select-the-right-initial-target-market",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Entrepreneurs are very used to hearing about the importance of selling into markets which are large and growing especially from potential investors.  Entrepreneurs must satisfy themselves at the earliest stages of their own personal due diligence on their business viability that the markets they wish to attack (e.g., the target markets) are large enough to support the entry of their new and better products.</p><p> At the earliest formative stages of business definition, when discovery is happening and technology is in the process of being developed, entrepreneurs are not likely to have a fully developed product documented; that is, details of design, expected costs, and market acceptance are assumed but have not been validated by focused research and development. In the case of technology, that technology may have more than one potential application, and it may not be immediately clear which application and market can be best targeted first.</p><p> Entrepreneurs may have an idea of what products should evolve from the technology being developed, but even that initial vision can be in error. It would not be unusual to determine through due diligence that the presumed target market is not the best one, and initial thoughts of a product must be altered dramatically to fit a preferred (alternative) target market. Target markets and products optimized for customers in those target markets must be matched.</p><p> <strong>  Matching the (right) product to the (right) market is a central tenet of good new venture thinking. </strong></p><p> The central issue of due diligence related to markets is to determine those markets (e.g., the target markets) that are sufficiently large and growing to support the entry of a new competitor (the entrepreneur&rsquo;s new venture).</p><p> <strong>  Professional investors generally insist that target markets be large and growing so that missteps and errors on the part of the new venture can somewhat be compensated for by the size of the market, which presumably contains large competitors who are not particularly concerned with competing with a small, upstart technology company. </strong></p><p> Nevertheless, venture capital firms in particular are interested in supporting companies that target billion-dollar markets rather than those that target million-dollar markets. Both the magnitude of investment considered and the interest of professional investors scale with the size of the markets to be served by the underlying technology.</p><p> Market research should consist first of an identification of market size and growth rates based on public data from trade magazines, public company reports (annual and 10-Q reports, for instance), newspapers, Internet blogs, etc. Recent trends in the growth (e.g., declining, rapidly growing, nascent, etc.) of the market should be noted. This information is necessary for purposes of defining the area of the company&rsquo;s interest, but it is not sufficient for defining the size and growth rate of the company&rsquo;s target markets. Of the products (and services) sold into the more general market, a determination must be made as to the sales volume and price of each product type sold within that market. While secondary sources of research may be useful, entrepreneurs may need to seek out primary sources of data. The end result, even if data is missing and must be assumed, should be a concise table showing a market segment matched to a product type along with estimates of volume sales, per unit pricing, and total market segment sales. At the earliest stages of founder due diligence, it is necessary only to make an early assessment of the most likely target markets (e.g., segments) the company will enter and their size and growth rates.</p><p> The goal for an entrepreneur is to identify a number of potential target markets that collectively (in a summed sense) have a large size, presumably in the billions-of-dollars range.</p><p> <strong>  One of these target markets will eventually be selected as the entry market&mdash;the market that offers the best prospect for producing profit soon after funding. That initial target market need not be large, but it must be one for which success is highly probable. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElysianCMG\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Harline  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.elysiancmg.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Elysian Capital Markets Group  </u> </a>  </p><p> There has been so much talk lately of bubbles bursting, and I don&rsquo;t mean the soapy kind. Investors seem to be looking over their shoulders constantly, hoping the proverbial arrow is not flying toward the asset bubbles that have swelled and pulled the valuation of their portfolios into a different stratosphere for the last six years.</p><p> However, asset bubbles aside, there seems to be another type of bubble burgeoning in size and scale. It has taken a human form and assumed similar characteristics. Often described as self-absorbed, entitled and spoiled, the significance of this expanding bubble is enormous, as it represents the hope of our future. This is not a bubble defined by an asset, currency or commodity. It is a far greater force, and one that leads directly to a path of technological freedom. This bubble of wonder possesses a spirited mind, yet is paralyzed by a level of intelligence, which only its kind can comprehend. This bubble lives and breathes in the largest population since the Baby Boomers. Its impact resonates boldly across our cultural canvas, although its presence penetrates with few words. Perceived to be the world&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Generational Bubble,&rdquo; this is the Millennial Generation.</p><p> But, is all the criticism fair? This generation has undoubtedly lead the &ldquo;technological&rdquo; charge, which in recent years has placed even the newest of emerging economies on par with those only found in the world of the Jetsons. Some have even compared Millennials to the last great generation, the Baby Boomers, suggesting that Millennials will likely be the greatest generation of all.</p><p> The mystique of the Millennial is fascinating to dissect. Born roughly between 1980 and 2000, <strong>  they are considered to be motivated, goal-oriented, ambitious and driven. </strong> They have been raised by parents who are passionate about getting involved in the lives of their children and who are often called &ldquo;helicopter parents&rdquo; because they &ldquo;hover&rdquo; over the lives of their sons and daughters from preschool to college. <strong>  Millennials are the most educated of any generation and are described as highly self-confident. </strong> Yet, they are also the generation most plagued with student loans, which take up a chunk of the post-graduate Millennial&rsquo;s income. As a result, <strong>  there has been a surge in the number of Millennials choosing to live at home with their parents. </strong> With less to spend, <strong>  Millennials are also putting off long-term commitments like marriage and home ownership. </strong></p><p> As is abundantly clear, Millennials have grown up in a time of rapid change, giving them a set of priorities and expectations sharply different from previous generations. The online-world and, in large part, <strong>  social media, have given Millennials a unique platform by which to reach the world. </strong></p><p> As progress continues, so does the expansion of the potential millennial bubble. In 2015, Millennials have emerged as the largest generation in the U.S. workforce. Likewise, as more Millennials transition into adulthood, the workplace will become a more diverse landscape. There will be a marked shift in how they work, and the official role Millennials will play in the business world as time passes. As such, <strong>  Millennials will offer unique skills that businesses will rely upon to stay innovative and competitive. </strong> Not only tech-savvy and keen to adaptability, Millennials are in the perfect position to reinvent what it means to be successful in a rapidly changing, technology-driven world.</p>",

    "title": "What Brands Can Learn About Managing Perceptions From Hyundai",
    "link": "what-brands-can-learn-about-managing-perceptions-from-hyundai",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Mercedes Cimino | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/6DBrandBuilding\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Six Degrees  </u> </a></p><p> I remember when Hyundai came to the United States automotive market as the first Korean automaker. Their first model was the 1986 Hyundai Excel. And it was a dog. The entry-level compact was very inexpensive, even for that class, and was still no bargain due to the glaring lack of quality.</p><h3> As human beings, we tend to form first impressions very quickly.</h3><p> <br/> For example, it takes about seven seconds for us to make a judgment about someone we just met. <strong>  The flip side of that is it takes a great deal more to change an opinion, once formed. </strong> So what can a brand do to change perceptions? It takes myriad factors, such as multiple factual data points, emotional rationale, social proof, repetition and time.</p><p> Today Hyundai enjoys a reputation as a maker of quality automobiles. The following is a look at how they got here in the context of consumer benefits.</p><h3> Function</h3><p> <br/> For many years the lineup of Hyundai vehicles was largely just functional. As such, the company needed to focus on improving the functional benefits of the product. Simply telling the market that the quality of the product was better was not enough. Hyundai had to prove it. The company&rsquo;s solution was to offer the best warranty in the industry. Not only did the longer warranty change consumers&rsquo; perceptions, it also changed internal behavior. Employees felt the pressure to deliver improved quality that backed up the warranty. In fact, they had to, or Hyundai would lose too much money on warranty claims.</p><h3> Form</h3><p> <br/> Hyundai entered the United States luxury automobile market with the XG and later introduced the Azera, Genesis and Equus models. Current models in Hyundai&rsquo;s luxury lineup have higher aesthetic appeal than in the past and boast more standard features than other luxury automobiles. They&rsquo;re also offered at lower price points. Why? Because Hyundai is not generally perceived as a luxury brand and the vehicles need additional appeal. With these vehicles the consumers&rsquo; self-expressive benefits (what the purchase says about the buyer) come into play in a different way than most luxury purchases. By getting more for the price, Hyundai luxury buyers can feel financially savvy and not status-seeking.</p><p> Hyundai&rsquo;s efforts have addressed the factors that can change perceptions and it is now generally considered a reliable brand with sales exceeding expectations, even in the luxury category. All that said, time is probably the most important factor to consider in this example. Nearly 30 years following its introduction in the United States, Hyundai has undoubtedly spent more money changing perceptions than it would have cost to develop a product that created positive perceptions in the first place. The take-away from this example is to not launch a product before it is ready. Negative perceptions in the mind of the target market create brand liabilities that take a lot of time and cost a lot of money to overcome.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If someone had told me when I graduated that I would own my own business in 10 years, have a successful blog (they didn&rsquo;t even exist then), become a professional speaker and be a sought-after authority on all things having to do with the world of work &ndash; I would have probably smiled and thought that person was a little looney. When I graduated, I had one focus and that was to become the CHRO in one of the big hospitals, Pharmaceutical or Clinical Research Organizations I was so fascinated with at the time.</p><p> Pretty quickly into my first job, I realized there were some things going on that I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for:</p><li> Human Resources wasn&rsquo;t puppies, sunshine and doing the greater good everyday as I had conjured up in my head.</li><li> The world of Staffing-while challenging sucked.</li><li> Being a leader of a large organization wasn&rsquo;t just a position of prestige and power- it inherently carried burdens and headaches I wasn&rsquo;t sure I wanted. <br/>  </li><p> Instead of getting too far ahead of myself, I continued to work hard in the roles I pursued. I worked to and above standards and made exits and pivots when situations no longer served me. I have moved up the org chart and down the org chart and now completely off anyone&rsquo;s org chart to progress my career. If you&rsquo;re dizzy thinking about what I just said, you should be- but in a good way.</p><h3> Approaching your career with a sentiment of rigidity, haughtiness and helplessness is no longer&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> The traditional expectation of a career is to land a role, work hard and move in one perfect line up the ladder. This may have worked in the past, but I can tell you that approaching your career in this manner is the surest way to become complacent, disengaged and even unhappy with your career trajectory. Sometimes you have to move two steps back to take two steps forward. Other times, you are thrown into an ecosystem and circumstances that are beyond your comfort level. Both instances seem like unreasonable and fruitless options; but nevertheless they are still options.</p><p> In my last PIC article of 2014, I mention that if you really want to achieve-you have to opt for the slightest bit of  <u>  discomfort </u>  to be great. Along with discomfort, change your linear mindset and grab the opportunities available to you. If your boss isn&rsquo;t developing you, create your own development opportunities. If your career has plateaued, consider the steps you can take whether lateral, backwards or completely out of the company to give it a lift.</p><p> Our careers are less about the people who manage us day-to-day and more about how we choose to manage ourselves and our lives. <strong>  Break free from the linear mindset and I promise you when you do- you will start to see possibilities and opportunities everywhere. </strong></p>",

    "link": "guide-to-workplace-structure-and-collaboration",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  What does true collaboration look like? </strong></p><p> From a the Guide to Assessing Teamwork and Collaboration published by the Galileo Educational Network,</p><p> &ldquo;Collaboration is a structured, recursive process where two or more people work together toward a common goal-typically an intellectual endeavor that is creative in nature?by sharing knowledge, learning and building consensus.&rdquo;</p><p> Much of what we need to do in order to make an organization function requires us to work with other people. Traditionally, it takes time to learn how to interact with each person&rsquo;s style, how to agree on the steps to take, roles and responsibilities, and individuals&rsquo; deadlines for a common goal. Managers incorporate various degrees of structure by defining roles and responsibilities, processes, project management, and methods of communication to complete the tasks to accomplish the goal.</p><p> There are various and differing opinions about how much structure strikes the right balance between helping to accomplish the goal efficiently and becoming a road block to productivity and creativity.</p><p> If not enough structure is in place, the team may be perceived as ineffective. Deliverables may not meet the expectations of the &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and/or leader(s) in terms of scope, quality, timeline, and/or budget. Often, in this low structure scenario, miscommunications occur.</p><p> Conversely, if there is too much structure, the team may be perceived as ineffective as well. In this scenario, it might be a time sink to go through all the process steps and the instructions may be so voluminous, people get lost and have trouble following the structure in place. In fact, too many meetings may take place that are focused more on the structure than on the goal, leaving a lull in initiatives moving forward. People may feel very restricted and disengaged and ultimately, Creativity is squashed.</p><p> For true collaboration within an organization or team, the structure and culture has to support two-way communication (creative conflict) built upon trust.</p><p> How much structure should you have in your organization?</p><p> Identifying the level of structure need in your organization depends on exploring a couple of key questions:</p><h3> 1) How big is your organization?</h3><p> <br/> If you are a small company with just few people working together, less structure may be preferable. A company with fewer people requires each person to understand more of the bigger picture. They typically have to do many of the tasks themselves and there may be fewer interactions needed with other people.</p><p> If you are a growing or larger sized company, the more people you have, the more structure you may need in order to be effective. People may be added in order to handle higher volume. More people typically means that each person handles a smaller part of the bigger picture. People become specialized in their roles with specific tasks. The more interactions and hand-offs it takes to complete, the more guidelines and processes you may need to help everyone understand how to work together effectively.</p><h3> 2) What culture do you want to foster?</h3><p> <br/> If you want to foster innovation and creativity, then you may want to have less detailed structure and more general high-level guidelines. Focus more on the goal you are trying to achieve, the communication channels needed to keep everyone in the loop, and fostering communication. Allow the team to figure out how to get to the end goal.</p><p> If your organization needs to foster nimbleness and an ability to react to changing customer demands, you also want to have less detailed structure and more high-level guidelines. Fewer restrictions allow employees to develop problem-solving skills in addressing customer issues quickly and foster engagement.</p><p> If your product has to be delivered precisely and there is no room for variability, then you will need more detailed structure and processes with step-by-step instructions.</p><p> If your organization is struggling with delivering and meeting expectations, then you will also need more detailed structure to help people stay on track. The detailed structure will hold people accountable for next steps /tasks and due dates, along with providing a more detailed analysis of the location of the breakdowns in the process and communications.</p><h3> 3) What are the natural behaviors of the people on the team?</h3><p> <br/> If you have a team full of naturally take charge, spontaneous, and creative people, you will need at least a little structure to help keep them focused and productive. However, you don&rsquo;t want to squash their natural strengths in problem solving, finding new or better solutions, and reacting instinctively to a dynamic business environment with too much structure.</p><p> If you have a team that is naturally very cooperative, planned, and anchored, they will need more structure to take advantage of their natural strengths of being able to follow instructions, ensure tasks are completed and results are delivered. These types of people are great at getting things done when the working environment is well-defined and there is less ambiguity.</p><p> Ideally the team would consist of a mix of traits that can provide for the proper balance of strengths to provide the best results.</p><p> How you add structure, and the culture you encourage, is important to fostering collaboration and creativity while still having enough structure to reduce miscommunication and issues and to ensure the outcome meets expectations.</p><p> Do you have the right level of structure in your organization?  <u>  <a href=\"http://dnabehavior.com/Guide%20to%20assessing%20teamwork%20and%20collaboration.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Use this Guide  </a> </u>  to aid in evaluating your team.</p>",

    "link": "how-to-deal-effectively-with-the-influencer",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> So many closing situations now come down to pitching to and trying to influence an influencer, that it&rsquo;s time to teach the proper way of doing it. A couple of things first.</p><p> An influencer is defined as someone who is involved in some way in the decision process &ndash; they either help make the decision, or they have to approve your product or service first before they pass it on to other decision makers, etc.</p><h3> The bottom line is that there is someone above them who weighs in heavily or who has the final say on whether or not to move forward with you.</h3><p> <br/> So the first thing you need to do is determine how your influencer fits into the decision process (if at all), and how much influence they have. Use the following questions during the qualification stage to determine this:</p><p> &ldquo;And ________, besides yourself, who else would weigh in on this?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;And how does that process work?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;What is your role in that process?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;And how much influence do you have in that process?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;What generally happens when you recommend something like this?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Do they generally go with your recommendation?&rdquo;)</p><p> Sometimes you&rsquo;ll be able to get through all these questions during the qualification stage, but if you get rushed, ask as many as you can. It&rsquo;s important that you have a clear idea of what your influencer&rsquo;s role is, and how much influence he or she actually has before you go through your demo or presentation later.</p><p> By the way, once you begin your demo, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to go back through these questions before you launch into your pitch. Doing so will give you a head&rsquo;s up as to how it&rsquo;s likely to end. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to know the stall before it even comes up? And once it does, here is how you handle it:</p><p> You: &ldquo;So from what we&rsquo;ve gone over, it sounds like this would be a great fit for you &ndash; let&rsquo;s go ahead and get you started today.&rdquo;</p><p> Influencer: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to have to show this to the committee.&rdquo;</p><p> You: &ldquo;I understand, and just out of curiosity, based on what you&rsquo;ve seen here today, do you personally think this would work for you (your company, department, etc.)?&rdquo;</p><p> Influencer: &ldquo;Yes, it looks good.&rdquo;</p><p> You: &ldquo;Great, then I take it you&rsquo;re going to recommend it to the committee?&rdquo;</p><p> Influencer: &ldquo;Yes I will.&rdquo;</p><p> You: &ldquo;Good. Just out of curiosity, what generally happens when you take something to the committee that you personally recommend?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> You: &ldquo;Good. Just out of curiosity, when you take something to the committee that you personally recommend, what do they tend to do?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> You: &ldquo;Great! And how much influence do you have with what they&rsquo;ll end up doing?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> You: &ldquo;Great! And how often do they go with your recommendation?&rdquo;</p><p> Note: If you get buy in that they generally go with what they recommend, then:</p><p> You: &ldquo;Wonderful! Since they usually take your recommendation, and since you&rsquo;re on board with this, here&rsquo;s what I recommend we do: I&rsquo;ll go ahead and get the contract out to you and schedule an install date. Once you get the approval, we&rsquo;ll already have much of the work done to get you going. Now, what is a good time for the installation of this?&rdquo;</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s break this down.</h3><p> <br/> The first thing you did (during the qualification stage) was to get clarity over how much influence your influencer actually had over the final decision. This is an important step that most sales people actually miss.</p><p> Next, at the end of your close, you make sure that the influencer was sold on your product or service first, before you went down the &ldquo;committee&rdquo; path. It&rsquo;s crucial you get their buy in at this stage.</p><p> After you do get their buy in, that&rsquo;s when you can ask if they&rsquo;re going to recommend it and how much weight their recommendation carries. After that, you do a trial close on paperwork, etc. You can make this as soft a trial close as you want, the point here is that you want to take your influencer as far as he/she will let you. The further they let you go, the more likely they&rsquo;ll be a deal later.</p><p> Start implementing these techniques in your sales calls starting with the qualification stage. The more you learn about the influencer, and their role, the better equipped you&rsquo;ll be to take the close further at the end.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> It is not unreasonable to have reasonable expectations, is it?</h3><p> <br/> Whenever we enter into an agreement with somebody else to work together on anything it is fair to say that we both have expectations about how the arrangement is going to work. That applies whether the arrangement is moving into a house together, helping each other along with a fundraiser, coaching a kids sports team, or doing business together.  Whatever it is we are about to do with that other person, both of us have expectations about how it is going to work, and generally speaking if both parties have reasonable expectations and are open about them there is a pretty good chance of things working out to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p><p> One of the issues that comes up repeatedly in professional services is the tendency for relationships to get started the wrong way. One party sets the expectations and the other finds themselves running to obey.  To a degree this is natural, and there should be an overweighted emphasis upon meeting the customers expectations primarily seeing as they are paying for the professional service.  So it is to be expected that one party in business will have higher expectations than the other, and the other party has a higher obligation to serve.</p><h3> But it is not all one-way traffic.</h3><p> <br/> It is entirely reasonable for the service provider to have some expectations about how the business arrangement shall work.  It is reasonable (for example) that the service provider gets paid fairly and promptly for providing the service.</p><p> The most frequent reason why so many professional relationships get unbalanced and we find ourselves in a situation where we wish we&rsquo;d never taken the client onboard in the first place is because both parties expectations were not made clear to begin with.  Clients need to be reasonable and business-like, and meet some basic expectations too.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Have you heard of the band OK Go? We hadn&rsquo;t until a few years ago when one of our kids showed us the now famous Rube Goldberg Machine  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   video  </a> </u> . We were hooked.</p><p> OK Go may be the only band around that&rsquo;s better known for its viral music videos than its actual music. The band&rsquo;s creative videos have been viewed more than a hundred million times, because they know how to entertain, engage and inspire. Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve learned from OK Go&rsquo;s viral marketing success.</p><h3> Do something nobody else is doing</h3><p> <br/> OK Go&rsquo;s videos are like nothing we&rsquo;ve seen before, because they&rsquo;re like nothing that&rsquo;s been done before. They don&rsquo;t meet anyone&rsquo;s expectations of what a typical music video should look like &hellip; but in a good way.</p><p> Almost every video OK Go has made has gone viral. And millions of people eagerly anticipate each new release. Our takeaway from this: OK Go has found its &ldquo;thing.&rdquo;</p><p> What&rsquo;s your &ldquo;thing&rdquo;? What are you doing that nobody else in your industry is doing? Maybe you give the most entertaining speeches or are a thought leader who is always sought after for commentary on a particular topic. Find your &ldquo;thing,&rdquo; perfect it and own it.</p><p> What&rsquo;s your &ldquo;thing&rdquo;? What are you doing that nobody else in your industry is doing?</p><h3> Put in real effort</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;re all pressed for time. The business world doesn&rsquo;t stop so we can focus on blog posts, social media or video marketing. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so tempting to skip the original content and share content from other sources with retweets or links to other companies&rsquo; blog posts.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the thing: truly memorable, shareable content is original. It takes real time and effort &hellip; and sometimes money. Keep sharing content from others, and hang on to your lower-effort marketing initiatives. But try to balance these things with a couple of bigger, more creative projects each year that will get you noticed.</p><p> Truly memorable, shareable content is original.</p><h3> Find a creative partner</h3><p> <br/> This isn&rsquo;t really about OK Go. It&rsquo;s about the car company that was smart enough to partner with them.</p><p> In their video for  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MejbOFk7H6c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Needing/Getting  </a> </u> , OK Go gets a moving Chevy Sonic to play its song for them. The car is transformed into a giant instrument and plays more instruments while the band drives. As a lower-budget band, OK Go couldn&rsquo;t have afforded to make this video on its own. Likewise, Chevy wouldn&rsquo;t have come up with this concept without OK Go&rsquo;s creative vision and talent.</p><p> Both the band and the brand got great exposure from their partnership (almost 32 million views as of writing and a prominent Super Bowl spot). The lesson here is that if you can&rsquo;t identify your &ldquo;thing&rdquo; or put together a big-push campaign on your own, find a creative partner who can help.</p>",

    "content": "<p> When trying to speak to my children in a way that they will remember (it is not easy), I regularly say to them in a funny, but somewhat serious way, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Be A Sheep.&rdquo;</p><p> Now that they are getting older, I don&rsquo;t get as many smiles and giggles when I say it, but I hope they are getting the message.  Don&rsquo;t blindly follow and don&rsquo;t be afraid to take the road less traveled.</p><p> Most anyone that I know tries to teach young ones this lesson.  The &ldquo;If Johnny runs off a cliff are you going to follow?&rdquo; talk.</p><h3> For some reason, however, many adults forget and act like herd animals when it comes to investing.</h3><p> <br/> Almost every day you can see examples of appeals to this collective amnesia in what I call &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be left behind&rdquo; headlines:</p><p> &ldquo;XWZ Is The Top Performing Strategy for Q1&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;ABC Investment Bank Projects that Growth Will Continue&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Flows Into HOT Asset Class Tops Past Records&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Time and time again the evidence suggests it is a loser&rsquo;s game to follow headlines like this, but time and time again investors rush for the cliff and run right over.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-31-at-9.15.39-AM.png\" width=\"426\"/></p><p> It is even worse when the headlines present something as the next shiny, new, complex strategy.  That seems to attract investors like moths to a light.</p><p> Just as good consumer product firms know the power of the herd when they use cartoons to market to kids or sexy models to adults, Wall Street also is a marketing and product development machine.</p><p> Investment product teams now include both quantitative analysts and marketing professionals, and they work closely with chief economists and strategists.  New New Things are created and then research papers are written and published in nicely packaged weekly or monthly investment strategy pieces.  The materials are sent to clients promoting the best thinking of the firm.  Then, after a few days, the new product, designed to be sold based on the research that hopefully has been talked up on CNBC, etc., is released to the sales teams (now often called Wealth Advisors or Managers).  If all goes well, the thundering herd is off and running.</p><p> I could go on and on about this and cite many research studies by investment professionals and academics who have won awards such as the Nobel Prize for Behavioral Economics.  I know that you have probably seen many of these reminders before though, so I will try to make my point using advice that I got early on in my investment career.  An old, southern-born manager told me, &ldquo;Son, people remember stories and like pictures, so get some stories and practice doodling.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  So here we go &ndash; two true stories and a picture. </strong></p><h3> #1 &ndash; The &ldquo;Honest&rdquo; Global Chief Investment Officer</h3><p> <br/> Once, I was having dinner with the Global Chief Investment Officer of the firm for which I worked at the time. I was asking him why his monthly commentary and the first few sections of his team&rsquo;s glossy monthly wealth management publication were becoming more and more short-term trade oriented (consider the advantages of shorting the currencies, etc.).  After a little wine, he admitted that most of the pieces would likely not add any value and that some, such as hedging recommendations and currency calls, were quite risky.  He then said,</p><p> &ldquo;Preston, what you need to understand is that I get paid to publish ideas that we can sell for a profit.  If I don&rsquo;t, the transactional brokers and management complain.  I then lose my job.  I learned a long time ago that it pays to feed the Street.&rdquo;</p><h3> #2 &ndash; The &ldquo;Honest&rdquo; CEO and Global Head of Alternative Asset Management</h3><p> <br/> In the process of trying to get good insight into a competitor&rsquo;s hedge fund portfolio for a prospect presentation, I went to the CEO of my then-company.  Previously, he had been the Global Head of Alternative Asset Management for the firm that had created the hedge fund portfolio that I was analyzing.  Perfect, I thought, he led the group that created all of the products.  After I gave him a brief overview, he smiled and said,</p><p> &ldquo;Preston, you&rsquo;re thinking too much.  You are correct, the performance of the portfolios has been bad.  We had a great brand though, an even better Ivy League MBA sales team, and we knew it.  So, we looked at products one way.  If we could sell them, they were good.&rdquo;</p><h3> # 3 &ndash; The Picture</h3><p> <br/> In April of this year, a lot of celebrating was going on related to the NASDAQ.  It had reached a new record and the herd was excited.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-26-at-8.20.12-AM.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-26 at 8.20.12 AM\" src=\"http://www.fwp.partners/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-26-at-8.20.12-AM.png\"/> </a> <br/> Source:  FactSet (index) and The Wall Street Journal</p><p> Many great &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be left behind&rdquo; headlines were published but, if you look closely, you will see the full, more sobering story.</p><h3> When was the last time the NASDAQ had a record close?</h3><p> <br/> In early 2000, just after record amounts of money had moved into technology stocks.</p><p> What came next? </p><p> The dot.com bubble burst and the NASDAQ was down 78% in only 19 months.  </p><h3> So what was all of the recent celebration about? </h3><p> <br/> The herd was finally breaking even, cheering its zero percent return for 15 years.</p><p> Unfortunately, this is nothing new.  Stories of the madness of investment crowds are found in the tulip bubble craze of the 17th century, the South Sea bubble of the 18th century, the &ldquo;Nifty Fifty&rdquo; of the 1970s, and the Japanese land and stock rise and then crash in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Charts similar to the ones above would also show the herd continuing to rush into real estate and mortgage backed securities in 2007. What came next?  The worst financial crisis in a generation, which was ignited by real estate and mortgage backed securities.</p><p> As we posted last week in our post,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/ideas/no-crystal-balls-just-peace-of-mind/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   No Crystal Balls &ndash; Just Peace of Mind  </a> </u> , please don&rsquo;t reach for returns.</p><p> Keep focused on your long-term plan, be patient, avoid the hot investment, only invest in what you understand, and do not be sold.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Be A Sheep!</h3>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I was the agent on duty and the woman in front of me was livid, accusing the FBI of harassment and invasion of privacy. As the duty agent, it was my responsibility to listen to her claims and determine whether they had merit or not.</p><p> It quickly became evident that she was working for an individual who had recently been indicted for money laundering and racketeering. So yes, the FBI was interviewing people to get a better idea of who else might be involved. Logically, that net would be cast wide.</p><p> Too wide for the likes of the woman determined to battle it out with me in the interview room.</p><p> FBI agents are rarely described as warm and fluffy, but neither are they the snarly, snarky shoot-from-the-hip of investigators often depicted on TV and in the movies. The reason is simple: there is a technique to winning an argument or calming down an individual to the point where they not only see reason, but agree to cooperate with an FBI investigation.</p><p> There are many types of warfare, and all of them involve some type of escalation between opposing opinions and points of view. Sun Tzu wrote an ancient Chinese treatise called &ldquo;The Art of War.&rdquo; His strategies could also be applied to business tactics today:</p><li> &ldquo;The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;To fight and conquer in all our battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy&rsquo;s resistance without fighting.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> An argument usually includes heated conversation, but in the business world it can also be a set of reasons aimed at persuading others to take a particular action or adopt an idea.</p><p> Either way, here are 11 FBI tactics on how to win an argument and get your point across:</p><h3> 1. Do Not Attack</h3><p> <br/> Attacking someone else&rsquo;s idea puts them into a fight-or-flight mindset.</p><p> Remember the advice of Sun Tzu&mdash;break down the enemy&rsquo;s resistance without fighting.</p><h3> 2. Start Off Friendly</h3><p> <br/> When you make your point in a very friendly manner, you automatically disarm others. It also keeps them from going for a defensive stance or position.</p><h3> 3. Show Respect</h3><p> <br/> Make an effort to respect the other person&rsquo;s point of view, no matter how ridiculous it sounds to you.</p><h3> 4. Ask Open-Ended Questions</h3><p> <br/> These type of questions allow the other person to explain themselves and not box them into a &ldquo;right or wrong&rdquo; answer. It encourages interaction and discussions.</p><h3> 5. Argue The Facts</h3><p> <br/> The single worst thing you can do during an argument is base your conversation around your feelings alone. Present the facts but use  <u>  mental toughness </u>  to control your emotions.</p><p> Strong minds have emotional intelligence. This means they can control their emotions instead of letting their emotions control them.</p><h3> 6. Ask How, Not Why</h3><p> <br/> Asking &ldquo;how&rdquo; their statement is right is not freighted with as much emotion as asking them &ldquo;why&rdquo; it is right. When someone tells you why they are right and you are wrong, it will make them more confident in their convictions. Asking them how will force them out of their emotional, limbic brain system and into their thinking, cerebral brain.</p><h3> 7. Concede</h3><p> <br/> One of the most effective ways to defang an argument in its tracks is to say, &ldquo;You are right.&rdquo; This does not mean you are forfeiting your point of view, but it does mean that you are acknowledging that they have a valid point.</p><h3> 8. Stay on Point</h3><p> <br/> When emotions are high, logic is thrown out the window. Do not be that person! Do not respond to irrational and/or emotional appeals of the other person, either, especially if they threaten to derail the main point of the conversation.</p><p> If needed, you can say, &ldquo;Interesting point and we can talk about that later, but right now we&rsquo;re discussing&hellip;&rdquo;</p><h3> 9. Use Data</h3><p> <br/> When talking, writing, or consulting about how to develop a mentally tough mind that can create breakthroughs, I back up my assertions with neuroscience data. This is not just me peddling a bunch of bullsh*t to pay my mortgage.</p><p> If you want to be taken seriously, use information that has credibility and backed by research.</p><h3> 10. Do Not Let It Escalate</h3><p> <br/> In his book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Political-Brain-Emotion-Deciding-Nation-ebook/dp/B0049MPKAU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431904862&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+political+brain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Political Brain  </a> </u> , Drew Westen writes that when people see or hear information that conflicts with their worldview, the parts of the brain that handle reason and logic go dormant. And the parts of the brain that regulate hostile attacks light up.</p><p> When an arguments start, persuasion stops. It devolves into a fight, and that brings another frame of mind to the situation. Suddenly, no one cares who is right or wrong and that is a sure way to fail.</p><h3> 11. Appeal To Higher Logic</h3><p> <br/> Try appealing to worthy motives or universal truths that are hard to dispute.</p><p> This is what ultimately worked with the irate woman in the FBI interview room. I agreed that it was unpleasant to have the FBI snooping around and asking questions about her. But, once I explained the higher logic of how the FBI was trying to identify accomplices involved in her boss&rsquo;s racketeering scheme, she agreed that only by interviewing people &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; would law enforcement be able to gather the evidence needed.</p><p> She eventually became an FBI informant.</p> ",

    "title": "3 Ways Financial Advisors Can Better Engage Millennials",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> A Millennial weighing in on how to market to Millennials.</p><p> How can Financial Advisors better court Millennials? Below are three strategies Financial Advisors can use to reach this non-traditional generation:</p><h3> 1. Change your preconceived notions</h3><p> <br/> Marketing to millennials in the financial services industry has been a hot topic this past year. Millennials are often written off as lazy, irresponsible and a technology-obsessed generation who aren&rsquo;t saving their money. A quick search of &lsquo;&rsquo;Millennials&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&rsquo;retirement&rsquo;&rsquo; shoots off results of how &ldquo;millennials may never retire&rsquo;&rsquo; or, &lsquo;&rsquo;millennials are too busy paying off debts to save&rdquo;. When we think about Millennials, many people have the mindset &lsquo;&rsquo;when they grow up,&rsquo;&rsquo; but what they miss is that it already happened for a lot of this generation.</p><p> In actuality, Millennials are saving more than almost every other age group. According to  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102566300\" target=\"_blank\">  CNBC </a> , millennials appear to be more sensible with their financial planning than baby boomers and Generation X. According to  <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Wells Fargo </a> , the majority of Millennials (53%) think about their financial future daily.  <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/young-money/some-millennials-are-kicking-butt-when-it-comes-to-saving-really\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Research conducted by CIBC </a>  states that 77% of 25-34 year-olds have started saving for retirement (60% of those 18-24 have as well). Lastly, according to a  <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/young-money/some-millennials-are-kicking-butt-when-it-comes-to-saving-really\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  study </a>  by online brokerage TD Ameritrade, Baby Boomers started saving for retirement at age 35. Generation X started at 28. Meanwhile, Generation Y, born in the 1980s and 1990s, began at an average age of 24.</p><p> The saving habits of Millennials are actually much better than the perception. It is important for Financial Advisors to change their mindset and recognize that Millennials can be a great-long-term client. This is a first step in reaching this demographic and gaining their trust. In today&rsquo;s world, there is a lot more onus on individuals to plan their finances sooner, rather than later, and that&rsquo;s where Advisors come in to help maximize Millennials savings.</p><h3>  2. Adapt how you communicate</h3><p> <br/> This generation has adopted digital like no other. Millennials are always connected. What are things that Millennials don&rsquo;t respond to? Voicemails. Letters. Telemarketing calls. Spam texts. In order to more effectively court Millennials, Advisors need to adapt their communication style. Ask your prospect how they would like to be communicated with rather then choosing your preferred method of communication. They are more likely to be engaged if it is a communication channel they use on a daily basis.</p><p> On that note, pushy sales people and Millennials are like oil and water. Give Millennials something authentic and useful. Make sure it&rsquo;s a conversation, and not a pitch. If what you can provide can better Millennials&rsquo; lives, or solve a real problem that they have, they will most likely get on board with it.</p><h3> 3. Adapt what you communicate</h3><p> <br/> A large number of millennials have never known a world without the Internet and social media. They aren&rsquo;t a group that will simply accept your message at face value and take the action you request. Millennials focus on solving real life problems through online research &ndash; both in search engines and social media. Financial Advisors need to be relevant and provide solutions online to Millennials&rsquo; financial challenges. What really gets Millennials attention is a well-written blog post that speaks directly to them and the challenges that they are facing. Millennials appreciate businesses that make useful information easy to find, answering their questions and doing their homework for them.</p><p> Millennials may not be as concerned with retirement right now, so rather then focusing on this subject, focus on goals that Millennials might actually want to save for like travelling, technology or buying a house. Advisors should take the time to understand how they can solve Millennials problems based on what this generation values and from there they will be better equipped to create value to the Millennial, instead of noise.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  When we say that the U.S. is a wealthy country, what exactly does that mean? </strong></p><p> Typically, people are referring to per capita GDP, but that's an income measure, not a wealth measure. Let's talk wealth measures.</p><h3> It may surprise you to know that the average household net worth in the U.S. as of 2010 was $498,800.</h3><p> <br/> That's pretty sizable. In fact, it's so sizable, you're probably saying to yourself: \"Really? Where's my $498,800?\" <br/> <br/> This shows the folly of talking about averages. If you put 100 Americans (chosen at random) into a room, their average net worth is likely to be near zero, because for every person who has a little home equity built up, there's someone else whose house is below water, and we all know the average American has very little cash in the bank. We're not a nation of savers. <br/> <br/> But if Bill Gates suddenly walks into that same room, everyone's \"average net worth\" becomes $790 million, because Gates has a net worth of $79 billion. <br/> <br/> So here's a more nuanced view of what's going on: <br/>  </p><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b5yttdd0t90/VWMs0TzC2hI/AAAAAAAADv0/PWLfCqWgdIo/s1600/WEALTH_PATTERNS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b5yttdd0t90/VWMs0TzC2hI/AAAAAAAADv0/PWLfCqWgdIo/s400/WEALTH_PATTERNS.jpg\"/></a>Wealth in the U.S. (click to enlarge).<p> <br/> The chart (which comes from  <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33433.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this report </a> ) says that as of 2010, the poorest 50% of Americans owned 1.1% of the country's wealth, while the top 10% owned 74.5% of all wealth. <br/> <br/> From 1989 to 2010, the bottom 50% saw two-thirds of their wealth disappear (going from 3.0% to 1.1%), while the top 10% saw its share go from 67.2% to 74.5% (an increase of 10.9%). The top 1% saw its wealth go up 14.6%. Over a third of America's wealth is concentrated in the hands of the top 1%, and that number continues to rise. <br/> <br/> Of course, on a global basis the picture is even starker, because so much of the world is poor. Currently, the top 1% (globally) own more than 48% of all wealth in the world, and it appears inevitable that the top 1% will soon own the majority of the world's wealth, if they don't already. <br/> <br/> But back to the original question: How wealthy is the United States? Here, we can talk about public sector wealth (we, the people; government wealth) or private sector wealth. Thomas Piketty presents the statistics in his book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067443000X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=067443000X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=asse0a-20&amp;linkId=LXDNPH73LRDMVRP5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Capital in the Twenty-First Century  </a> </u> . The bottom line is that public sector wealth is near zero because the total value of all government holdings (including all public property, government buildings, airports, railways, highways, military bases, weapons systems, etc., plus cash on hand and gold in Fort Knox) is almost exactly counterbalanced by the national debt. The only net wealth in America is privatewealth (equal to about four years of GDP), and as we've seen, that's in the hands of relatively few people. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Presidential candidates, please discuss. </strong></p>",

Do you agree with this advice, or have any helpful tips of your own?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://wealth.northerntrust.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Northern Trust Wealth  </u> </a></p><strong> A flight delay, an eyebrow wax and an entrepreneurial spirit inspire a new way to book salon appointments.</strong>Some top tech companies started in the unlikeliest of places, like college dorm rooms and garages. For Coco Meers, the idea for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_prettyquick_?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> PrettyQuick</a>, an app that matches users with nearby salons and spas that have open appointments, came while she was stuck in an airport.&ldquo;I had a flight delay, and were it not for being stuck in an airport, I would have used that 'found time' to get my eyebrows waxed, an errand that had lingered on my to-do list for too long&rdquo; says Meers, 32. &ldquo;I thought: Why isn&rsquo;t there an app where I can just press a button and be connected with a trustworthy, available aesthetician to do my eyebrows?&rdquo;From there, PrettyQuick was born. Similar to restaurant reservation sites, the app allows a user to log on, select a service &mdash; like a manicure, haircut or massage &mdash; and browse all available, recommended salons. Once a member verifies appointment details, PrettyQuick confirms the opening immediately either through text or push notification.The app is free to members, and a team of beauty editors vets all salons and spas. Spa services, including tip, are billed directly to the user&rsquo;s card on file. &ldquo;I just wanted to make it easier for women to take care of themselves,&rdquo; Meers says.<h3> The Brains Behind PrettyQuick</h3>A Birmingham, Alabama, native, Meers moved to Chicago in 2009 after working as a brand manager for L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al in Paris for five years. The Windy City&rsquo;s entrepreneurial community inspired her after a brief stint as a marketing consultant for local startups.&ldquo;I knew I could do something with my corporate experience, but I wanted to do something bigger,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Starting something from the ground up felt like the best opportunity to make the biggest impact.&rdquo;But she knew turning the &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment in the airport into a viable business wouldn&rsquo;t be easy. Women-led private tech companies are more capital-efficient, achieve 35 percent higher return on investment, and when venture-backed, bring in 12 percent more revenue than tech companies led by men, according to a 2014 book by Vivek Wadhwa and Farai Chideya titled, &ldquo;Innovating Women: The Changing Face of Technology.&rdquo; Yet women start only 3 percent of tech companies.Having earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in English from Princeton University, Meers knew she needed to improve her formal business education in order to launch her tech startup. So in 2010, she began her master&rsquo;s in business administration degree from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.&ldquo;I never wanted to look at my own financial statements and not understand what was going on,&rdquo; she says.While at the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Meers rounded out the rough edges of her beauty app idea and met the future chief operating officer of her company, Shreena Amin. Amin&rsquo;s investment banking background provided a strong complement to Meers&rsquo; beauty industry expertise.The pair went door-to-door to hundreds of salons and spas throughout Chicago to determine how an app could best serve the local beauty industry. &ldquo;A high-end hotel spa is vastly different than a small neighborhood nail salon, but they all had something in common, and we needed to find that common pain point,&rdquo; says Meers.Over and over again, she heard that salons and spas had no reliable way to market themselves. While many said that their business came from word of mouth, that wasn&rsquo;t easy to track or quantify. PrettyQuick could change that by providing salons and spas with a simple, easy-to-learn platform to book customers, fill empty seats in off-peak hours and increase their exposure.In the fall of 2013, Meers officially launched PrettyQuick in Chicago, where she intends to become a household name for beauty booking by mid-2015. PrettyQuick is also available in Washington, D.C., Boston, Dallas, Miami and San Francisco. Not one to set small goals, Meers expects to launch in 40 markets over the next four years and grow the business into a billion-dollar brand.<h3> Finding Inspiration Outside of the Business</h3>&ldquo;As an entrepreneur, you have to live and breathe your business,&rdquo; Meers says. &ldquo;But if you allow yourself to get out of your own head and out into the world, you&rsquo;ll find inspiration and guidance in all parts of your life that you&rsquo;d never expect.&rdquo;For Meers, inspiration is derived from the arts. A ballet dancer for most of her life, she knows firsthand the transformative power of the arts.&ldquo;It was a source of discipline and creativity, a physical and emotional outlet,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It exposed me to music, lights and stage production, and nothing excited me more than being in the theater and making something out of nothing.&rdquo;Meers co-founded the Joffrey Ballet&rsquo;s Auxiliary Board in 2010, joined the board of directors in 2012 and now serves as co-chair of the ballet company&rsquo;s marketing committee.Staying involved philanthropically isn&rsquo;t just something she does for fun or out of obligation &mdash; she needs it. All entrepreneurs should make it a priority, she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met mentors and business leaders through my work with the Joffrey. Every time I interact with the arts community, I take something incredible from it.&rdquo;On top of her business and philanthropic work, Meers also became a first-time mother in March. As for how she navigates all of the personal and professional responsibilities, she admits that she doesn&rsquo;t have all the answers, and that&rsquo;s OK. &ldquo;Ask me again in six months,&rdquo; she says.She&rsquo;s gotten some advice from other trusted entrepreneurial mothers and knows there will be bumps in the road. But she has no intention of slowing down.&ldquo;My focus on this company isn&rsquo;t at odds with the kind of mother I want to be,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I work all the time. But I also love my work, so it doesn&rsquo;t feel like work. I want to show my daughter that she can do anything she sets her mind to.&rdquo;And hopefully she&rsquo;ll treat herself to the occasional massage or manicure while she&rsquo;s doing it. ",

    "content": "<p> We finally had the chance to catch one of the busiest people in the industry for a chat on her career as an entrepreneur, a leader in financial services, a new offering and a hidden talent. Enjoy!</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s different about you is that you&rsquo;ve been an entrepreneur for a while now. Tell us about your path. </strong></p><p> I had a very successful corporate career and had the opportunity to run large departments at a young age. I was always the &ldquo;fix-it&rdquo; person and could take on a challenge and figure out how to make it work. But, from the time I was in college I knew that I wanted to be a consultant. I took a course in my graduate studies where we worked with small companies that needed business expertise. I loved it and knew it is what I wanted to do for a living.</p><p> Over the years I&rsquo;ve had a chance to serve Interim roles at a number of firms: Interim VP of Sales for a financial technology firm, Interim Chief Operating Officer for an advisory firm, Interim Director of Relationship Management for a custodian so I&rsquo;ve kept my corporate skills fresh even whilst working as a consultant. I have a nice mix of &ldquo;insider/outsider&rdquo; perspective and have been able to continue to leverage my domain knowledge. It&rsquo;s amazing how often it comes to bear and in so many ways. I&rsquo;m thankful to have been able to stay in my original industry.</p><p> <strong>  What made you make that jump so early in your career? </strong></p><p> I was asked to take over just &ldquo;one more&rdquo; area that needed fixing. I was running an institutional investment sales organization that I had helped to develop and we were doing well. Honestly, when I was asked to take over a failing group instead and get it on track, I just decided I was done being the fix-it person! I tendered my resignation one week shy of my tenth anniversary. Many people thought I was crazy to walk away from such a wonderful career but thank goodness it has turned out well!!</p><p> <strong>  How would you describe The Collaborative and its evolution over the years? </strong></p><p> A learning process! I started out with a partner and we had worked in the retirement area. We believed that solid participant education was a business. We incorporated as The Collaborative for Investment Education, Inc and set out to sell our amazing educational programs. We found out, a couple of years into the process, that our sales and marketing talents were what the financial firms wanted. We transitioned into providing marketing support and sales training. Over the years we have added the behavioral element and the organizational design piece. We&rsquo;ve also built a full scale marketing team that does websites, brochures, etc. Today we have a breadth of coaching, training, marketing support and program development focused on helping advisors, and those that serve them, to grow and prosper. At this point we&rsquo;ve worked with the largest firms in the world, and down to the one-person advisor practice. There is very little we haven&rsquo;t seen or done by now.</p><p> <strong>  At one point in the journey &mdash; as I am told &mdash; you were a bit of a hypnotherapist, which is something we can talk about in 2015.  Tell us more about that. </strong></p><p> Yes! I became Certified as both a Hypnotherapist and a Hypnosis Trainer in 1991 and 1992 respectively. I had a very active practice for many years. It&rsquo;s one of the things that got me interested in the human behavior element for business. Why do some people make change and some don&rsquo;t? Why do we make poor choices and then regret them? All of these are so important to business owners and their teams. I became a Certified Behavioral Analyst and Certified Values Analyst in 2002 and now also have that training.</p><p> <strong>  Is it still part of your offering? </strong></p><p> I was asked, by Adams Media, to write a book called Self-Talk for a Calmer You and most of it is based on my hypnosis training. I do use it with clients, showing them how their self-talk can hurt them but I don&rsquo;t talk about it as &ldquo;hypnosis&rdquo; per se. It&rsquo;s embedded in a lot of our work, however.</p><p> A couple of years ago I trademarked the term &ldquo;The Human Behavior Coach&rdquo; to bring in my deep knowledge of how people think, alongside my deep industry experience.</p><p> <strong>  How can someone best use your resources? </strong></p><p> Most of the time they work with us directly either to rebrand, redefine (or define) who they are in the market and how they tell their story. We create a platform of materials to support their efforts. They work with us directly for coaching and for training. We do a lot of program development for custodians and other investment firms. I still write books and just released The Pocket Guide to Sales for Financial Advisors so that is the cheapest way to access our intellectual capital!</p><p> We also do a lot of hiring support. Some of our advisors would not dream of adding a new team member without running our profiles and having us do a &ldquo;debrief&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve helped many new hires to succeed, and teams to work out their differences.</p><p> Our newest offering is the Advisor&rsquo;s Sales Academy where advisors and their teams can access us live but do it remotely. It&rsquo;s been a dream of mine for some time to take our proven work and make it more readily accessible.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;ve also adopted a forward-thinking workforce as well.  Many of your employees are remote. I think this is important to discuss as Advisors have to outsource many of their business activities as well. You do it as a company &mdash; how does that work for you and can you share ways Advisors can manage this sometimes difficult practice. </strong></p><p> Yes, I came to this kicking and screaming. I always thought &ldquo;face time&rdquo; was critical but then I found the best resources around but none of them wanted to move to Boston to sit with me! The one thing I have found is that we are amazing in our productivity being remote. We talk about what we&rsquo;re doing and then we just ACT on it. We get so much done!! People are always asking me how we can create the things we do in such volume and with such quality but I believe this is one of the keys. We don&rsquo;t have endless meetings. I think advisors needs to identify those areas that don&rsquo;t require an on-site person &ndash; things like billing, accounting, marketing, follow-up calls, general admin can all be done remote. It allows the advisor to access the best talent and only use what they really need. The one important thing is to be disciplined. I know what everyone is working on, and when it should be delivered and we keep to very tight timelines. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have very independent and dedicated staff, too. That&rsquo;s another key &ndash; hiring people who are self-motivated.</p><p> <strong>  Any keys to success on how to keep employees engaged? </strong></p><p> Communicate, communicate, communicate. Make sure they understand clearly how their role fits into the overall goals of the firm. Give timely feedback, not just as a performance review once or twice a year but real-time, &ldquo;This is what you did well.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;This is what I would like to see changed.&rdquo; Most people are hungry to know they are making a contribution and how they are doing. Being a part of something is a human desire and knowing that connection exists with one&rsquo;s work is so key.</p><p> <strong>  What changes have you seen in the industry in the past 10-15 years? </strong></p><p> The most dramatic, and probably because it is my personal passion, is the recognition that this is not a numbers business, it&rsquo;s a people business. We have two large clients with a sole focus on the &ldquo;people aspect&rdquo; and we see it woven into the stories of many others. Realizing this is whole-life planning and not just saving for retirement is a big change from where we were.</p><p> The other changes are, of course, technology based. Instant access to information can be great, and can be challenging. Clients know more (but yet less) than ever! Advisors are embracing things like video, audio, client portals etc like never before. I think there is more of a recognition that just because you are technically competent, doesn&rsquo;t mean your services will sell. It&rsquo;s a very crowded market and investors have a harder time than ever discerning how the offerings differ.</p><p> <strong>  What do you think are the most important areas Advisors need to address in their businesses as they look forward? </strong></p><p> Two pieces: One is recognizing that &ldquo;sales&rdquo; is not a four-letter word but a critical process to help the firm grow and thrive. Most advisors are financial people and learning to sell is something they overtly reject but it is going to become even more critical.</p><p> The other is learning how to select and motivate the right people. We use a behavioral tool called &ldquo;DISC&rdquo; and if I had my druthers I would have everyone on the planet go through the process. We work all day long with partners, teams, new employees etc who don&rsquo;t get along or are ill fit for a role. Making the right hire, then motivating that person to success is something few firms do well but it has such a dramatic impact.</p><p> <strong>  How do you think they should approach the millennial generation? </strong></p><p> In addition to running this firm I teach college classes at Suffolk University in Boston. I work with 18, 19 and 20 year olds all of the time. What they want is to understand context &ndash; why are you asking me to do this? How does it fit into the  overall scheme? What does my contribution offer to the firm? Most are hungry to make a difference. They are willing to work their way up, but they want to see the path and know how to get from this stage to the next. Again, communication is the key.</p><p> <strong>  You have a new offering &mdash; The Advisor&rsquo;s Sales Academy &mdash; tell us about that. </strong></p><p> This was a long-time dream of mine. We&rsquo;ve developed so much proven content over the years but many advisors can&rsquo;t afford our webinars or our training. However, they need the information. The Sales Academy is a one-stop shop to get live training and feedback in so many developmental areas. We see it as a training ground for new staff, a growth opportunity for successful advisors who want to improve and as a replacement for costly coaching and training.</p><p> The webinars cover a variety of topics and the Mastermind Group will be a way for advisors to share ideas with one another. Anyone who has trained with us will testify that we are all about action and impact.</p><p> <strong>  And you have a special discount for Advisorpedia readers. </strong></p><p> Yes, we do &ndash; using the code Advisorpedia20 will get the advisor 20% off on all webinars or our ecourse.</p><p> <strong>  Does the industry have you hopeful for the next generation of Advisors? </strong></p><p> It does! I&rsquo;m very encouraged by the emphasis and recognition of what we call &ldquo;the human factor&rdquo;. Realizing how important people&rsquo;s money is and how central it is to their lives has been a long time coming. The younger generation grew up more comfortable talking about needs, emotions and feelings so I think they will make very good advisors bringing these skills, alongside financial knowledge, to clients.</p><p> <strong>  What would you like to leave us with? </strong></p><p> The truth is that I still like to fix things and help people to succeed. I truly love the work we do here because we are able to see measurable impact on our client&rsquo;s businesses. We believe our job is to make our clients look good and be the best that they can be. And we are always looking for ways to reach a broader audience and do more. We enjoy feedback and insights so I&rsquo;m hopeful that readers will be inspired to share ideas about how we can continue to share our work with those who need it.</p>",

    "title": "Is Sales or Better Client Retention the Best Way to Grow an RIA Firm?",
    "link": "is-sales-or-better-client-retention-the-best-way-to-grow-an-ria-firm",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riainabox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RIA in a Box  </u> </a></p><p> If a small business seeks to grow, traditional business wisdom is quite simple: devote more resources to sales and marketing efforts in order to win more new clients. Registered investment adviser (RIA) industry experts generally advocate a similar approach if an advisory firm wishes to accelerates its growth. While it is true that bringing on new clients will generally lead to asset and revenue growth, a deeper dive into the unique characteristics of the investment adviser industry raises the question as to whether more firm resources should instead be allocated to increasing client engagement and retention.</p><h3> The RIA Industry's AUM Pricing Model is the Envy of Other Industries and for Good Reason</h3><p> <br/> One of the most unique characteristics of the RIA industry compared to most other traditional industries is the assets under management (AUM) pricing model. While there is renewed debate around whether the AUM pricing model will one day be complemented by or ultimately replaced by a flat-fee or retainer-type pricing model, the industry today still almost entirely charges on an AUM-based fee model. Very few industries have the luxury of an established pricing model which has a built-in price escalator as the value of the client's portfolio, while often volatile, generally rises over time.  <u>  <a href=\"https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/saving-investing/model-portfolio-allocations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vanguard notes  </a> </u>  that a traditional moderate portfolio (50% stocks and 50% bonds) has an average annual return of 8.4% from 1926-2014.</p><p> Assuming the advisory firm charges an average advisory fee of 1% per year and using Vanguard's average portfolio returns, a new client who hires an RIA firm with a beginning moderate risk portfolio value of $1,000,000 would generate around $10,000 in year one client fee revenue. However, by year 10, assuming an 8.4% annual return that client's portfolio value would now total approximately $1,901,000 after advisory fees equating to $19,000 in annual fee revenue from that client. Of course, this basic math while not perfectly scientific, is well understood in the industry. Yet it seems that  <strong>  the investment adviser industry at times does not fully appreciate how lucrative of a pricing model it possesses.  </strong></p><p> In the above client scenario, the cumulative client fee revenue over the ten year period is just under $141k. On other hand, a fixed $10k per year price would have generated $100k in cumulative revenue over that same ten year period. Thus, in this scenario, the escalating effect of the AUM pricing model led to a nearly 41% increase in total cumulative revenue. Now instead let's assume the client continues to remain an advisory client for twenty years with the firm. Over this longer period, the leverage of the AUM pricing model becomes even more pronounced. In such a scenario, the cumulative client fee revenue over the twenty year period is just over $428k compared to $200k in cumulative revenue over the same time period under a fixed $10k per year fee. As such, the escalating effect over 20 years now leads to a 114% increase in total cumulative revenue. </p><p> While long-term client retention is generally a powerful growth tool for a business in any industry, it's an even more powerful growth accelerator in the investment adviser industry given its pricing model leverage. The above scenario also illustrates the compelling economics in increasing the average client relationship life. If the above client leaves the firm after 10 years, the firm is losing out on nearly $288k of future incremental revenue that can be earned in years 11-20. </p><h3> The RIA Client Referral Growth Multiplier Effect</h3><p> <br/> Often, traditional \"How to Grow Your RIA Firm\" wisdom focuses on new client business development. These may include hosting local seminars, advertising in local publications, sponsoring local events, and strengthening relationships with local centers of influence (accountants, estate planning attorneys, etc.). While such strategies can be very successful with proper dedication and firm focus, not all principals of advisory firms have the budget or natural comfort to pursue such initiatives.</p><p> The good news for such firms that have a desire to grow but inability to implements the above business development tactics, is that  <strong>  it may be easier for an RIA firm to grow faster and larger by instead focusing on existing client retention rather than on new client business development.   </strong></p><p> To make our case, we first need to make some basic assumptions and dive into some more analysis. First, let's make the following sample advisory firm assumptions:</p><li> Total Clients: 50</li><li> Average Beginning Client Portfolio Size: $1,000,000</li><li> Average Annual Advisory Fee Charged: 1.0%</li><li> Average Annual Client Portfolio Return: 5.0% <br/>  </li><p> So, here we have a classic advisory firm with $50 million in AUM serving 50 clients with average annual portfolio growth slightly below Vanguard's moderate portfolio estimates. Let's now next assume the following client growth, referral, and retention metrics:</p><li> New Non-Client Referral Clients Added Per Year: 3</li><li> Annual Client Retention: 90%</li><li> Client Referral Rate: 5% <br/>  </li><p> Thus, we are assuming this firm brings on 3 new clients every year which are not referred by an existing client. There are various figures on industry client retention but most studies put the annual client retention rate in the 80-100% range depending on client age, length of relationship, etc. In addition, we are assuming that 5% of the firm's clients will refer a new client with the same characteristics to the firm on annual basis. In other words, on average a client refers one client to the firm over 20 years.</p><p> With the assumptions above, the sample $50 million AUM advisory firm will conclude year 10 with around $74.36 million in assets (48.7% in total cumulative asset growth) and $6.38 million in cumulative revenue. This is detailed below:</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA Firm Focusing on New Client Business Development\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmAUMGrowthScenario1.jpg?t=1432669212675&amp;width=626\"/></p><p> Now instead let's assume the same $50 million AUM firm shifts resource focus away from bringing on new non-client referral clients and instead focuses on driving client engagement and satisfaction ultimately leading to higher annual client retention. In this modified scenario, we change only two assumptions:</p><li> New Non-Client Referral Clients Added Per Year: 0</li><li> Annual Client Retention: 95% <br/>  </li><p> With the modified assumptions above, the same $50 million AUM advisory firm will conclude year 10 with around $74.40 million in assets (48.8% in total cumulative asset growth) and $6.29 million in cumulative revenue. This is detailed below:</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA Firm Prioritizing Client Retention to Grow \" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmAUMGrowthScenario2.jpg?t=1432669212675&amp;width=626\"/></p><p> The results in both of the above scenarios are eerily similar despite the fact that in the second scenario, the firm is putting no resources towards winning non-referral clients and instead prioritizing increased client retention. </p><p> Now, let's look at a third scenario in which the same $50 million AUM advisory firm prioritizes not only increased client retention, but also on internal focus to increase existing client referrals from 5% to 10% of clients in a given year making referrals. Thus, the assumptions are:</p><li> New Non-Client Referral Clients Added Per Year: 0</li><li> Annual Client Retention: 95%</li><li> Client Referral Rate: 10% <br/>  </li><p> With these last modified assumptions above, the same $50 million AUM advisory firm will conclude year 10 with around $118.47 million in assets (136.9% in total cumulative asset growth) and $8.32 million in cumulative revenue. This is detailed below:</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA Firm Increasing Client Referrals\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmAUMGrowthScenario3.jpg?t=1432669212675&amp;width=626\"/></p><p> By moving the client referral rate from 5% to 10%, the same firm was able to increase year 10 total assets by close to $44 million and cumulative ten year revenue by over $2.5 million. Now imagine what may be achievable if the firm was able to move the annual referral rate to 20% (each client making a client referral once every five years), the RIA client growth multiplier effect is a tremendous growth lever for advisory firms.</p><h3> Couldn't the same results be achieved through new client business development?</h3><p> <br/> A fair question in relation to the above scenarios is couldn't this same growth be achieved by instead focusing on new client growth? The answer is yes. However, it may not be as easy to replicate those same results as it seems.</p><p> To quantify this a bit, let's again revisit that same $50 million AUM investment advisory firm used in the previous examples. It turns out that if the firm instead focused on new client growth instead of on improving client retention and referral rates,  <strong>  the advisory firm would need to win around 7.6 new client relationships each year in order to achieve similar results as seen the final scenario above. </strong> This is detailed below:</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA AUM Growth by Adding New Clients\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmAUMGrowthScenario4.jpg?t=1432669212675&amp;width=626\"/></p><p> Bringing on close to 8 new non-client referral clients a year to sub-$100 million AUM RIA firm is possible, but in our observations, it's generally the exception rather than the norm. Bringing on such clients requires dedication, and unfortunately at times that new client business development focus can come at the expense of the existing client experience. Every growing investment advisory firm faces the constant tug and pull between bringing on new clients or spending more time and resources on existing clients.</p><p> In addition to this internal resource struggle, new client acquisition often has a significant financial cost to the firm. Hiring and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-supervision\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   compliance supervision  </a> </u>  of a business development-focused investment adviser representative (IAR), a long multi-year sales cycle, dinners, and other marketing costs, are all factors that can contribute to a significant  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_acquisition_cost\" target=\"_blank\">   client acquisition cost (CAC)  </a> </u>  for RIA firms. As such,  <strong>  the case for focusing resources on existing clients can at times be an even more compelling argument when the CAC of a new advisory client and front-loaded client service and portfolio management work needed to bring on a new client is fully factored into the   <u>   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value\" target=\"_blank\">    lifetime value   </a>  </u>   of the client. </strong> Many investment advisory firms need the client to stick around for a few years before the firm fully recovers its acquisition cost of winning that new client and the client becomes profitable. </p><p> Initially, most principals of emerging,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/is-your-ria-firm-registered-in-the-proper-states\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   state-registered RIA firms  </a> </u>  have ambitions to bring on new clients while never losing a desirable existing client. Ultimately, many firms are forced to make a decision as to where to focus limited resources. Traditionally, the principal has decided to pursue the new business development route as that is what intuitively seems to make the most sense: to grow, I need to go out and bring in new clients to the firm. For new firms entering the investment adviser industry, that decision is often not much of a decision as the firm desperately needs to clients in order to start building a business.  <strong>  However, once a firm reaches a critical mass of clients, it may make sense for the principal of the firm to take a step back and start thinking more about optimizing the existing client experience rather than focusing on bringing on more clients.  </strong></p><h3> Hire a new Director of Business Development or Client Success?</h3><p> <br/> While there are likely a handful of progressive and large RIA firms that have a Director of Client Success or similar role at the firm, this is far from a traditional role at an advisory firm. Instead, firms looking to grow tend to devote more resources towards sales and marketing often by hiring or recruiting a new advisor that will be focused on generating new client relationships. Again, such a strategy matches traditional wisdom and there is nothing inherently wrong with that wisdom. </p><p> However, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.customersuccessassociation.com/csa/definition-customer-success-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Director of Client Success role  </a> </u>  is a new emerging position that has gained initial traction in the software as a service (SaaS) industry. In a nutshell, this role is focused on improving client engagement by optimizing the client experience ultimately leading to longer client retention and when optimized, more client referrals. While the investment adviser industry is quite different from the software space, it does share a common theme in that in both industries, much of the long term profitability of the client is dependent on client being retained for many years given the significant upfront acquisition and client on-boarding costs. As such,  <strong>  it may be time for the RIA industry to start considering its own version of the Direct of Client Success position. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Many RIA firms looking to accelerate growth will often consider our   <u>   Rushmore Advisor Services practice management platform  </u> </strong>  if they are looking to utilize a single platform that already includes many of an investment advisory firm's key technology requirements. The platform includes a number of features designed to increase client engagement and retention including portfolio management and reporting, automated billing, automated account aggregation, a client portal, a robust customer relationship management (CRM) system, and document storage. The price begins at $375 per month per advisor and also includes access to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/myriacompliance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MyRIAComplianceTM  </a> </u> , an online RIA compliance software solution.</p>",

    "link": "how-to-best-use-metrics-in-your-pitch-deck",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> So you&rsquo;ve lined up some investors who wanna hear your pitch. Congrats! You&rsquo;ve already accomplished more than 90% of the gurus giving startup advice on Quora. Go ahead and celebrate that little factoid for a minute or two and then come back here &mdash; we&rsquo;ve got a lot to discuss. Specifically, how to make the metrics in your pitch deck woo your audience by reinforcing your vision.</p><p> First, a little perspective: your current metrics &mdash; however sexy &mdash; will not, by themselves, get you funded. Investors consider a lot of other factors. The metrics you choose to include in your pitch deck should demonstrate your company&rsquo;s hypothesis or rationale (why you&rsquo;re doing what you&rsquo;re doing).</p><h3> Another thing about metrics: they&rsquo;re not static. They&rsquo;re a snapshot. </h3><p> <br/> Just think of how many online businesses look good on Tuesday, only to get flushed down the toilet once Amazon tweaks their algorithm on Wednesday. Certainly your metrics will carry more heft if you&rsquo;ve got paying customers. But whatever your metrics look like, potential investors will always ask themselves whether they could help improve on them: &ldquo;Are their customer acquisition costs reasonable? Is 6 mos to recover CAC too long?&rdquo; If investors see any positive wiggle room in your metrics, you&rsquo;re not in, but you&rsquo;re not out either. &ldquo;Not out&rdquo; is a hopeful place to be.</p><p> Another thing to remember about potential investors is their vision for your company. Most will require you &mdash; by contract &mdash; to include them in all major business decisions. If you take their money, you gotta take their advice. So on top of your current metrics, they&rsquo;re also looking to see whether you&rsquo;re teachable, professional, and not a total douche bag.  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Freidhoffman.org%2Flinkedin-pitch-to-greylock%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPOqdiwMipBqAbRwCvVY61LI1ZsA\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Investors are 100X more likely to give money to entrepreneurs who look like sane, fun people to work with  </u>  . </a></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reidhoffman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Reid Hoffman  </a> </u> , one of the founders of LinkedIn, says the typical partner in a VC firm is exposed to 5,000 pitches a year, looks more closely at 600 to 800, only to do one or two deals. Depressing? Kind of. But if you can make your pitch compelling, exciting, and duh! why-didn&rsquo;t-I-think-of-that obvious, than you&rsquo;re at least in the game.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s a simple checklist for framing the metrics in your pitch deck:</h3><p> <br/> Apples to Apples comparison: When putting your metrics in context, you have to get the category right. That means if you&rsquo;re pitching SaaS, your customer acquisition costs (CAC) should be compared to other SaaS products like Apptio or Pitchbook&hellip; NOT Zynga, Candy Crush, or World of Warcraft. Of course getting the comparison right means defining the type of business you&rsquo;re in. That is something a LOT of intelligent entrepreneurs bungle.</p><p> It fits into the arc of your story: Your pitch deck&rsquo;s job is to hold the attention of your audience until the very end. It will include your story. It should move quickly to frame the problem you&rsquo;re going to solve or the opportunity you&rsquo;re going to grab. Once that&rsquo;s established, you can then safely reveal your metrics, knowing your audience is up to speed. If you reveal numbers too quickly, you could easily break their concentration, kill momentum, and encourage annoying questions before finishing.</p><p> For example, if you&rsquo;re pitching an app targeting the millions of Americans who (sincerely) join gyms every year but never go, you first have to take your audience on a journey. Make them feel the pain of frustrated people who can&rsquo;t commit to going to the gym&hellip; who hate themselves for being overweight&hellip; who have failed over and over at fitness accountability. You&rsquo;ve inserted a giant hook into their emotions and now your metrics &mdash; downloads per month, recency, user engagement &mdash; will appear more credible and authoritative.</p><p> It resonates with your audience: You gotta know who you&rsquo;re presenting to. If that means bringing them cupcakes, so be it. Losing your dignity is a small price to pay for collecting a fat check! Seriously, find out who will be in that room when you do your pitch and tailor it to their biases.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not saying to throw out your presentation and start over with a new pitch deck. What I&rsquo;m saying is that a few well-placed comments or references could endear one of the audience members to you. You gotta remember, if they vibe with you, they&rsquo;ll talk you up to their partners. Your odds of getting funding increase. It&rsquo;s psychology 101.</p><p> Look up each investor online. Find out what their investing philosophies are. Find out what they&rsquo;ve written about the startup world. Almost everybody today has a paper trail. For example, maybe one of your investors has a vendetta against PayPal. He loathes their ignorant customer service and crappy exchange rates, allegedly. As it happens, your new payment service addresses this very problem. So, while revealing how fast your service is getting picked up by online vendors (growth rate), throw in a counterpoint to why you&rsquo;re a better play than PayPal.</p><p> Reveals hidden information: Your investors are typically smart humans. The good matches will know something about the space you&rsquo;re entering. They probably have an idea about the metrics typical for your industry. What you want to show them in your pitch deck is why you&rsquo;ll be successful in a market where so many others have failed.</p><p> So for example, if you&rsquo;re seeking funding for a new mobile ad service to compete with Google, you wouldn&rsquo;t drone on about the rising number of people who shop with their smartphones. That&rsquo;s old news, aka you wouldn&rsquo;t lead with metrics re: the &ldquo;hottest consumer mobile usage trends.&rdquo; Instead, you&rsquo;d show them how your service is attracting the 65% of AdWords account holders who are sick of overpaying with each click simply because they haven&rsquo;t been able to crack the Quality Score code.</p><h3> Now, a quick warning about how NOT to use metrics in your pitch deck:</h3><p> <br/> Endless Bullet Points: If you&rsquo;re a data head, it&rsquo;ll probably won&rsquo;t come easy for you to leave some of the metrics you&rsquo;ve gathered out of your pitch deck. But you have to, because your audience only cares about a few of them at this point.</p><p> Remember, this is a first date. You don&rsquo;t need to be all up in their face with metrics they didn&rsquo;t ask for. That means, if you&rsquo;re primarily raising money to scale up because you&rsquo;ve got a working system in place, show them month-over-month and year-over-year growth. Leave the social media mentions out of the pitch deck. Save all non-critical metrics in a handout and give it away after the presentation.</p><p> Bragging Rights: Your company may legitimately be a hot item, a darling if you will. You&rsquo;re gaining traction, everybody&rsquo;s noticing and you&rsquo;ve got shiny metrics to show for it. In fact, you&rsquo;ve analyzed every conceivable threat to your baby and whaddya know&hellip; there are none. You&rsquo;re ready to disrupt a whole industry!</p><h3> So, should your pitch deck let your metrics speak for themselves?</h3><p> <br/> Nope, not at all. There are no SURE things in the startup world. Your investors could probably poke 1,000 holes in your numbers if provoked. Venture capitalists in particular have no problem taking down cocky entrepreneurs (see Shark Tank). Insert your best (appropriate) metrics into the story of your pitch deck and then stand back and listen (humbly) to their feedback.</p><p> Panic Buttons: Every young business faces obstacles. Investors know this. They expect you to acknowledge risk factors, which turn up in your metrics. It&rsquo;s your job to speak to these risks &mdash; low conversion rate, high churn rate, employee turnover &mdash; and communicate your plans for solving the problem. This is a good time to demonstrate your willingness to seek their advice.</p><p> White Lies: Unless you&rsquo;re a sociopath, you probably don&rsquo;t plan on lying to potential investors. But it could happen if you start projecting financials 1, 3 or 5 years out. It&rsquo;s in the future &mdash; that hazy tomorrow &ndash; where assumptions morph into the ol&rsquo; BS metrics. Yes, it&rsquo;s true that some investors will expect to see detailed financial spreadsheets for the year 2021, but those are the overly sensitive control freaks you probably want to avoid. Any investor who&rsquo;s been around the block knows that for startups, long-term metrics are just a loose framework for planning purposes.</p><p> Many investors will tell you that they only put money in &ldquo;metrics-driven companies.&rdquo; Of course that&rsquo;s become a clich&eacute; but your pitch deck has to show them that you&rsquo;re one of those companies. Make it easy for them to grasp by delivering your key metrics at exactly the right time in your pitch deck.</p><p> So, what do you think? Are you ready to start pitching?

Almost in every country around the world (Singapore, Australia, United States, Hong Kong, New Zealand) clients said the advisor is not demonstrating enough value and rank the advisor client progress meetings low when it comes to importance and value. The questions that were asked included how well your advisor keeps up to date with your changing financial needs and update you on progress towards your financial goals. What processes do you include in your client progress meeting to demonstrate value?</p><p> Everyone has a process. It is developed over time with software systems and experience. How do top advisors demonstrate value to their ideal client&rsquo;s. While analyzing the numbers is important, it is not as important as measuring people&rsquo;s lives. How are they doing for their retirement, do they have enough to live on? Are they going to be able to retire? Are their children going to go to university soon? In other words, are they achieving all the financial goals and dreams to which they aspire? This is a different approach from that of the salesman who has a new financial product to sell this year. Remember, people don&rsquo;t care how much you know, but know how much you care! I also recommend you hole-punch the statements so your clients can add them to their client binders.</p><p> <strong>  Idea number two, have binders for your clients </strong></p><p> You can also package the client progress meeting documents in presentable folders, hole-punched so they can add these to their binders; and year by year they can look at their annual client progress documents and see their progress towards completing and reviewing their financial plans, goals, dreams and outcomes . Make it a system to which the clients become accustomed, and the experience will be an extremely positive one focused on the clients, their lives and not the news or other noise.</p><p> <br/> Advisor Practice Management and Bachrach &amp; Associates, Inc. is presenting a new live webinar series made up of 5 live webinars personally conducted by Bill Bachrach.  <u>  www.billbachrach.com/elevate-apm </u></p>",

    "content": "<p> My client, Laura, had invited me in to observe the spectacle. I watched as she carefully articulated her research findings and presented her &ldquo;no brainer&rdquo; suggestions to Mark. Each time Laura&rsquo;s ideas were met with a similar response, &ldquo;Thanks so much,&rdquo; followed by a bogus reason of why the idea wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p><p> The conversation was the equivalent of Laura saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to give you 100 bucks. No strings attached. I just found a way to save the money and I&rsquo;d like to give it to you.&rdquo;</p><p> And Mark saying, &ldquo;Well, thanks for making the effort, but I&rsquo;ll have to think about that for a while, talk to some other folks and see what they think, and then get back to you.&rdquo;</p><p> Mark was clearly afraid to make a decision, even if it was obviously a good one.</p><p> Perhaps you&rsquo;re dealing with Mark or his doppelg&auml;nger. If so, here are a few ideas that can help</p><h3> 5 Ways to Help a Decision Maker Decide</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Ask More Questions </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re met with resistance, stop selling and start asking questions to understand why.</p><li> How do you think this change would impact the customer experience?</li><li> Have you ever tried anything like this before? How did it go?</li><li> What&rsquo;s driving your hesitation?</li><li> Who else needs to be involved in such decisions?</li><li> What do you think would happen if we implemented this approach? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. Provide a Clear Path Forward </strong></p><p> When presenting an idea to a guy like Mark, don&rsquo;t just talk conceptually. Be crystal clear on what your idea would take to implement: specifically who would need to do what by when.</p><p> Folks like Mark are often afraid of change because it just sounds like too much work. Show how moving forward with your plan is easier than sticking with the status quo.</p><p> <strong>  3. Make it Reversible </strong></p><p> One of the biggest reasons for decision paralysis is that it feels so permanent. Find a way to let them taste the impact of the decision in a way that can be easily reversed. Got a new process? Try it with one team. Worried about the customer experience? Try your idea out with a small subset of customers and carefully monitor the experience. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to sell-in a pilot, than to convince a risk-adverse decision maker to make a &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; change.</p><p> <strong>  4. Include Others </strong></p><p> If Mark suggests a need to socialize the idea with others, offer to tag along. Chances are if he&rsquo;s afraid to make a decision, he&rsquo;s equally afraid of expressing his opinion to his boss or other stakeholders.</p><p> Offer to support him with an enthusiastic, &ldquo;Awesome, I&rsquo;d love to join a quick call to help you socialize the idea.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  5. Don&rsquo;t Give Up </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s hard helping some people. But stay humble. This isn&rsquo;t about you or your Mark, it&rsquo;s about doing the right thing. There&rsquo;s nothing more convincing than someone passionate about doing the right things for the right reasons.</p><p> Give Mark a chance to sleep on it, and give it another go.</p><h3>  </h3><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s no surprise that social media is becoming seen as the cure-all drug for businesses. It offers an avenue to get to know them, build relationships, offer AWESOME customer service, and yes &ndash; sell. And let&rsquo;s be honest, that&rsquo;s what most folks are interested in social media for anyway.</p><p> But the deal is, social media is NOT an overnight fix, does not become successful easily, and takes TRUE dedication.</p><p> Something I continually see in my conversations with clients and prospects is this obsession with ROI, the eternal question of: What&rsquo;s in it for me? And that&rsquo;s okay, every wise business owner should be asking the same question, but my question to them is:</p><p> What kind of dedication are you willing to give to gain the results you want?</p><p> I&rsquo;m a big fan of Gary Vaynerchuk. I can&rsquo;t always handle his intensity or his cussing, but his business philosophies are ON POINT, and his customer service methods are second to none. And something Gary continually preaches is that to be successful, we must be patient, we must fully commit.</p><p> And I wish that more business owners could apply this point of view to social media marketing instead of seeing it as just something they&rsquo;ve got to do for a little while.</p><p> In this article, I&rsquo;m going to discuss WHY being successful with social media takes time from real life and marketing prospectives.  I believe that understanding social media is the first step, and if we aren&rsquo;t actively educating our clients and prospects, then their expectations will never be met.</p><h3> 1. Real relationships take time.</h3><p> <br/> Think about it &ndash; how long did it take you to befriend your newest friend? And I don&rsquo;t mean the person you casually hang out with or work with, I&rsquo;m talking about the person you trust and share private information with.</p><p> Probably took some time, right? Maybe even a lot of time. Maybe you didn&rsquo;t even like each other at first, but once you began talking, there was a synergy, a connection. You shared interests and life stories, and before you knew it &ndash; it was like you&rsquo;d found a piece of yourself.</p><p> Now imagine if all of that took place online &ndash; in an environment where you couldn&rsquo;t read their facial expressions or had to get to know their humor through words and emojis. Would have probably taken longer, right?</p><p> That&rsquo;s relationship-building on social media, and it&rsquo;s something we work towards everyday for our clients.</p><p> Building relationships takes a lot of time, effort, and commitment.</p><p> Our job as marketers is to locate people who are a good fit to connect with a product or service. Maybe they have the same interests (coffee, wine, exercise, reading, etc.), the same personality (outgoing, witty, thoughtful, etc) or have connections with those personalities and interests.</p><p> Once we identify those people, we begin down a road towards developing a relationship. We say hi, introduce ourselves, thank them for being a part of our social community, share their content, comment on things they do or say, laugh about everyday nuances or commiserate over issues.  We don&rsquo;t sell or preach directly in this process, we answer questions they have, add value to their lives, and establish credibility by showing up consistently.</p><p> Then one day, they ask us to tell them more about our product or when a friend of theirs has a problem we can help with, they recommend us because we&rsquo;re at the top of their mind, and have been putting in the work.</p><p> All of this takes time. We can&rsquo;t be pushy, we must be thoughtful and respectful because that&rsquo;s how relationships are built. And it&rsquo;s best to keep in mind from the beginning, that we will have to work HARDER for those relationships because of the environment in which we&rsquo;re communicating.</p><p> But before you go off thinking this sounds all gooey and lovely, but hey &ndash; you&rsquo;ve got to make money &ndash; understand that we NEVER hide the fact that we&rsquo;re selling something.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no reason to apologize for wanting to make money or build your business &ndash; it&rsquo;s just how one goes about it. And in the social media world, being pushy only gets you pushed OUT.</p><p> We&rsquo;re dealing with humans, not numbers &ndash; so relationships take time, commitment, and consistency.</p><h3> 2. Adding value takes time.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard this &ldquo;give value&rdquo; phrase like a MILLION times in relation to social media, but do you know what it means?</p><p> What adds value to your life? Are you a person of learning, growing, laughing, or connecting? What makes you walk away from a conversation feeling excited, renewed or like you&rsquo;ve had an epiphany?</p><p> Value, of some kind.</p><p> Our definitions of value change depending upon all the variables that make up who we are as people, as individuals. And those values are what attract us to certain decisions, products, services, people, life paths, and jobs in life. They make us feel at home, understood, and accepted. And they make us fiercely loyal.</p><p> The job of social media marketers is to get to know what values are going to speak to the audience we will inevitably sell to. Because we&rsquo;re all different, one value may bounce of a certain type versus grab the attention and love of another. We&rsquo;ve got to figure that out. And again, because we&rsquo;re dealing with humans &ndash; that&rsquo;s NO simple task.</p><p> And then once we&rsquo;ve figured out the values of a particular target audience and discovered what speaks to them &ndash; we have to share a lot of that content, and on a consistent basis. We have to continually make sure that our quotes or articles or videos are speaking directly to the core values of what they believe, need, and love.</p><p> Sounds complicated, right? Yea&hellip; Content creation is a whole different subject, but the effort put into curating and creating content must always take the audiences value into account or it will fall to deaf ears.</p><p> When we strive to add value to the lives of those we interact with online, it strengthens our relationships, it adds levels to what we can ask of them or how we interact. It matures relationships.</p><p> We must post with purpose, always.</p><h3> 3. Loyalty takes time.</h3><p> <br/> At first, I wanted to caption this section, &ldquo;Selling takes time,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m jumping in too quick.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s consider the brand Target. Everyday droves of people scramble to this establishment to pick up the latest fashion, electronics or toys. But before Target made itself worthy of all those people, it built a loyal customer base by developing relationships (they knew what people wanted) and adding value (quality merchandise). This base spread the word and before we knew it, Target was a household name.</p><p> Loyalty premeditates selling in the business world. It&rsquo;s the pot of gold, the fountain of youth &ndash; the eternal goal. And when we begin achieving loyalty, business is soooo sweet.</p><p> Why? Because we get to work less to convince people we&rsquo;re worth their loyalty, and get to focus more on serving, interacting, and enjoying. We get to do the fun stuff!</p><p> Going back to relationships for a moment, isn&rsquo;t it nice when our relationships reach the point of loyalty? When we can be ourselves and feel accepted? When romantic courtships turn from dating to exclusive? When an acquaintance becomes the person you would do anything for?</p><p> Heck, yes! Loyalty is a huge emotion, and it&rsquo;s one we actively chase in marketing. When we can grow loyalty among the people in our online communities, then we have folks waiting in expectation to hear from us, to share our content or promotions, and to tell the world how fantastic we are.</p><p> But to gain loyalty, we have to build a relationship and offer value. Loyalty doesn&rsquo;t just appear, and sometimes it&rsquo;s easier than others, but true loyalty takes hard work, commitment, and patience.</p><h3> 4. Consistency</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no way I could write an article about how much time it takes to be successful with social media without talking about consistency, because  <u>  <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/the-number-one-ingredient-for-social-media-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   as I&rsquo;ve said before  </a> </u> , without consistency, NONE of this matters.</p><p> The hardest part of my job isn&rsquo;t getting new clients, building social communities for clients, or the everyday tasks executed for clients &ndash; it&rsquo;s getting my clients to understand that social media REQUIRES consistent effort, and that takes time.</p><p> At  <u>  <a href=\"http://archdigitalagency.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ARCH Digital Agency  </a> </u> , we don&rsquo;t sign clients without a 6-month commitment for two reasons: 1) We can&rsquo;t guarantee consistent results before that time period, and 2) Clients need to understand that social media isn&rsquo;t a short term fix or an overnight solution. It REQUIRES the client to make a commitment and be a participating part of the relationship.</p><p> And sometimes it takes longer than six months to begin seeing consistent results, depending on the industry. Certainly industries are a lot harder to work with than others, especially those that don&rsquo;t naturally generate a lot of visual content. It&rsquo;s harder to humanize brands that rest on their logos, that sell products or services that aren&rsquo;t considered &lsquo;sexy,&rsquo; and don&rsquo;t spend much time interacting with their customers.</p><p> But that doesn&rsquo;t mean social media isn&rsquo;t for these businesses or isn&rsquo;t a viable channel for their marketing. Typically these industries are more focused on generating numbers, which is short-sighted when it comes to social media because they aren&rsquo;t taking into account the relationships being built, the fact their brand name is being spread across the Internet to people who&rsquo;ve never heard of them, and that social media isn&rsquo;t straightforward.</p><p> For example, think of a billboard you pass on the road or a TV commercial featuring some mouth-watering hamburger or pizza or pasta. It probably doesn&rsquo;t make you rush out the door to go get it. But maybe you see the billboard/commercial a few more times, maybe a friend mentions it and you recognize it, and then when you&rsquo;re absolutely starving and can&rsquo;t think of where to go, BAM, that billboard/commercial pops in your mind.</p><p> That&rsquo;s one way that social media works, too. But it doesn&rsquo;t work if you aren&rsquo;t consistently investing in it or if you decide it&rsquo;s too tough to keep it up.</p><p> Businesses who are struggling with social media need to stick with it, make a true commitment and hunker down for the long ride, just like the rest of us. It&rsquo;s infinitely easier to sell a $10 t-shirt than a $750/monthly service because of the effort we have to put into developing relationships, adding value, establishing trust and loyalty, AND being consistent.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re stuck and down on social media, stop thinking of it as some kind of marketing channel you want to win over. Change your point of view, consider what it takes for brands to win YOU over on social media, and then replace that with the people you&rsquo;re trying to reach.</p><p> If we don&rsquo;t understand our prospect&rsquo;s point of view, respect what it will take to build a relationship, and understand that loyalty doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight, we will never win. Because inevitably, it&rsquo;s not about us, it&rsquo;s about them. And without them, we are NOTHING.</p><p> Social media success takes time, and if it was just some fad or trend, we wouldn&rsquo;t see SO many having success with it. MAKE the commitment to social media, commit yourself to developing relationships, adding value, growing loyalty, and being consistent. I can guarantee you&rsquo;ll be successful if you have the patience to ride it out.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Long term care insurance is a hot topic.</h3><p> <br/> It is designed to protect against asset depletion when a person is deemed unable to perform two of the six activities of daily living, such as bathing and eating.</p><p> We believe the increased interest for long term care insurance is from personal experience. Many people in their mid-40s to mid-50s have recently seen the reality of long term care needs with their parents. The challenges of coordinating care for a parent are only compounded when there are limited funds to pay for the necessary care. However, despite the realities of long term care needs, there remains a sizeable gap in the public&rsquo;s perception of long term care.</p><p> There used to be a saying about long term care: If you can afford it, you don&rsquo;t need it; and if you need it, you can&rsquo;t afford it. The truth is that a thorough review of someone&rsquo;s asset base and financial needs often reveals that long term care insurance is a prudent hedge against asset depletion.</p><p> Typically there are two scenarios that occur when a person needs for long term care: Home care or nursing care at a facility.</p><li> <p>  Home care: Having a home health aide visit might cost $150 per day, depending on where in the country you live. That works out to $50,000 a year &ndash; a figure some people can afford. </p></li><li> Nursing care facility: A stay at a nursing home is about $250 to $350 a day. That works out to $100,000 a year &ndash; a figure fewer people can afford on their own.</li><p> <br/> ​One strategy we recommend is for the client to self-insure up to a point and only insure the portion that they are not able to meet financially. For example, if a client can afford home care, but not nursing care, then insure the difference rather than a policy for the full amount. This is one example of how a long term care policy can be tailored around the client&rsquo;s needs.</p><h3> Old policies are gold.</h3><p> <br/> Many people with old long term care policies are experiencing premium increases, which is happening with the majority of carriers. Because the older premiums are more competitive than what is on the market today, sticker shock is to be expected. Those who are seeing a 70% - 90% increase in premiums should understand there are options.</p><p> For example:</p><p> Many cost-of-living riders have a 5% compounded interest; the benefits purchased at $150/day have increased 5% every single year for the last 10 years. This means a lot of policies are now far richer than what is actually needed.</p><p> If the inflation rider was changed from 5% rate to 2.5% rate, going forward, the rider will be completely in line with the cost of care. These reductions can reduce or eliminate premium increases completely.</p><p> Just remember: there are ALWAYS options. Replacing an old policy is generally not the best course of action. Advisors should work through old policies to discover how to make them affordable.</p><h3> Understand new benefits.</h3><p> <br/> In an evolving marketplace, we are seeing carriers present new benefits to tackle the long term care dilemma. Benefits like cash riders and limited premium payment options allow for greater customization within a client&rsquo;s financial plan. Reviewing long term care now can provide clients with benefits they may not have considered in the past.</p><p> There are a lot of moving parts in long term care, but there are also a lot of solutions - you just need to start the conversation.</p><p> What long term care planning have you done? What&rsquo;s your game plan?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Just like those crazy kids with their saggy pants and loud music, corporate storytelling and content marketing feel new and alien to some of the more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; players in a corporate ecosystem. (#understatement) Add in the frequently opaque ROI of digital - you know, that whole 'what the company is supposed to get from the narrative' thing - and its understandable that content marketers may feel like they're at war with their own organizations. So let&rsquo;s just call it like it is</p><p> <strong>  In a push to corporate storytelling, you frequently need to convert your coworkers to the cause. #Irony: winning your coworkers is often harder than winning new customers. </strong></p><h3> I know I can&rsquo;t be the only marketer on LinkedIn that&rsquo;s been in this meeting:</h3><p> <br/> Me (to client): \"... Have you considered content marketing?\"</p><p> Client: &ldquo;Love Content Marketing! We should definitely think about that. But what we really need is some product marketing that sells directly to the decision maker&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Enter my friend and colleague  <u>  Matthew Woodget </u>  and the Trojan Horse. In his most recent post in our social dialogue, \" <u>  You&rsquo;re doing corporate storytelling all wrong </u> \", Matthew argues that a full-frontal assault on institutional resistance to corporate storytelling is a recipe for disaster. And he&rsquo;s right. (Did you read what he wrote?) The reality is - you need to find some way, ANY WAY, to get your colleagues to trust you enough to grant you a seat at the table. Hence the Trojan Horse. BUT, and this is a big but, I think Matthew underestimates the power of plot to erode internal resistance to change. </p><h3> \"If a content marketer falls in the woods, and no one's there to hear it, will it still go viral?\"</h3><p> <br/> Corporate paralysis is the threat that every content marketer faces. Paralysis born of fear of the unknown - \"What if it doesn't work?\" Paralysis resulting from too many possibilities - \"Should we do an app? A social campaign? A web series? There are so many paths...\" Paralysis that results from uncertainty of the benefit - \"So we do all this stuff, and then what?\" The response, for too many: it's safer to do nothing than to take the risk at all. If that doesn't sound like paralysis, I don't know what does. Which is ironic given that the only way to achieve a benefit from Content Marketing is taking action. And when it comes to story - plot is action. </p><p> So you see, just as we need to take action to move our customers, we need action to move our coworkers, as well. And the best way to do that, to move our coworkers, is to spend less time equivocating about building narratives and more time actually executing them</p><p> What we need is more action (plot!) to get things going. Because there can be no ROI if nothing is done at all. Bottom-line: only when you stop fighting about  content marketing, and start experimenting with it, can you get on with the business of what matters: creating stronger connections... with everyone.</p><p> Agree? Disagree? Hey, That&rsquo;s What the Comments Are For!</p><p> Liked it? Loved it? Why not Share it or Tweet it or both! </p>",

    "content": "<p> One question I hear from clients all the time: After we sign the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Will  </a> </u> , where should we keep it?</p><p> Before we answer that question, let&rsquo;s ask another, related question: What if your loved ones can&rsquo;t find your Will?</p><p> Consider the matter of famed Olympic runner,  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Griffith_Joyner\" target=\"_blank\">   Florence Griffith-Joyner  </a> </u> , the fastest woman in history. In 1998, at the age of 38,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/23/sports/track-and-field-griffith-joyner-died-after-seizure-in-sleep.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Ms. Joyner passed away in her sleep when she suffocated after an epileptic seizure  </a> </u> .</p><p> After her death, her grief-stricken husband,  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Joyner\" target=\"_blank\">   Al Joyner  </a> </u>  was unable to find the original Will executed by his wife. By California law, Mr. Joyner was required to file the original document within 30 days of her death. Because he could not find it&mdash;he could not file it.</p><p> As a result, Mr. Joyner and the mother of Ms. Joyner engaged in estate  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/litigation-risk.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   litigation  </a> </u>  for four years following her death.</p><p> Even if you take the time and effort to create  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estate planning  </a> </u>  documents&mdash;if the documents cannot be found and filed, you are considered to have died  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intestate.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   intestate  </a> </u> . This means your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   assets  </a> </u>  are divided according to state  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probate.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   probate  </a> </u>  law&mdash;even if your family members know you put your wishes on paper.</p><p> What if you only have copies of your Will? In New Jersey, you can only probate an original version of your Will. If you only have copies, you&rsquo;ll have to file a  <u>  <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/motion\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   motion  </a> </u>  with the Court, which can often be costly and extremely time-consuming.</p><p> Back to our first question, where should you store your Will? Consider these suggestions for preserving your documents&mdash;in order to preserve your wishes:</p><li> There is no legal requirement to store your Will and estate planning documents in any particular place. You can store your executed Will at home, at your office, or with business associates.</li><li> Safety is an important factor. In New Jersey, flood and storms destroyed critically important documents stored by families in homes and offices in recent years.</li><li> Many people store important documents, like a Will, in their  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-deposit-box.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   safety deposit box  </a> </u> . This is ONLY a good location if the box is held jointly, with a spouse or loved one. In the event of your death, a person co-named on your box may remove the documents. Otherwise, your family may face a wait to have the box opened after your death. As a general rule, we don&rsquo;t recommend using safety deposit boxes.</li><li> We recommend that original copies of our clients&rsquo; Wills be held in our fire-proof safe. If our building burns down, your Will is still safe. Also, if you have to make changes to the documents in the event of a birth, or divorce, we can quickly create new documents for your signature. <br/>  </li><p> Regardless of where you store your Will, tell loved ones where you placed it. Give a copy to your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   executor  </a> </u>  and leave written instructions indicating where the original can be located.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Left to my own devices, I&rsquo;m the type of person who has a contingency plan.</p><p> And a contingency plan for my contingency plan.</p><p> My brand of anxiety likes to plan for any and all eventualities. <br/> Some of these comfort me: like knowing what items to grab from my apartment should a natural disaster occur.  </p><p> And others just take up room in my mind: like knowing what I&rsquo;d want on my playlist for the aforementioned disaster.</p><p> This compulsive need to plan impacted every area of my life.</p><p> For example, in my 20s, I had a boyfriend who consistently cancelled plans because he had to work, he overslept, or had a hangover. This annoyed the shit out of me. But, in a well-intentioned effort to &ldquo;make things work,&rdquo; I decided to manage my expectations and always have a plan B.</p><p> The problem was that long after our relationship ended, the pattern remained. I still needed an alternate plan in case things didn&rsquo;t work out. Be it a backup job opportunity, a backup friend, or a backup brunch order in case they&rsquo;re out of bacon (again).</p><h3> So why is this a bad thing?</h3><li> Because it prevented me from going all in.</li><li> It prevented me from ever truly &ldquo;showing up.&rdquo;</li><li> It prevented me from respecting my boundaries. <br/>  </li><p> In short, it obstructed my ability to create what I truly wanted (Plan A).</p><p> Contingency plans aren&rsquo;t about increasing your chances of success or happiness, they're often about fear. Plan B is all about survival mode. And, not surprisingly, survival mode is not where dreams, creativity, or potential flourish.</p><p> Knowing there&rsquo;s an alternate plan gives us a way out. It protects us from disappointment.</p><p> For example, had I stopped having a plan B when he&rsquo;d cancel, the disappointment may have fueled me to communicate that his behavior didn&rsquo;t work for me rather than engaging in a codependent tango. (Tango lessons were another thing he didn&rsquo;t show up for, btw.)</p><p> So now, plan A is the only plan I sign up for. I don&rsquo;t waste my energy on hypothetical plan Bs because it&rsquo;s less energy that can go into plan A. And much like plan A can&rsquo;t coexist with plan B, living with passion cannot coexist with fear.</p><h3> So How Do You Muster The Confidence, Space, And Drive To Go All In?</h3><p> <br/> By consciously redirecting your energy, tapping into that obsessive ability to plan, and directing it toward plan A.</p><h3> Here's How: </h3><li> <strong>  Activate it. </strong>  Motivation is an emotion. And like any other emotion, it cycles. At the start of your plan, capitalize on the excess by creating a reserve that you can tap into later.  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/goal-motivation-worksheet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Here&rsquo;s how. </a></li><li> <strong>  Anticipate it. </strong>  What obstacles have come up in the past? What might come up in the future? When you see an obstacle, troubleshoot it and make it part of the plan rather than creating a backup plan.</li><li> <strong>  Accept it. </strong>  Your path may not look the way you anticipated. That&rsquo;s okay. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to get creative and experiment. The skills you develop along the way will help you with your next goal.</li><li> <strong>  Assimilate it. </strong>  Spend time studying the parts of your plan that didn&rsquo;t look as expected. Instead of beating yourself up, ask yourself: what stopped me? What obstacles got in my way that I can anticipate next time? What parts helped me to succeed? Learn from experience and assimilate it into your plans.</li><li> <strong>  Re-Activate it.  </strong> Go back to #1 and review your answers. Tapping into your motivation to achieve plan A will help you to stay the course rather than jumping to plan B.</li>",

    "content": "<p> In the dating scene, the business world and in social situations women need ways to show their confidence. Body language is a great way to assert control and communicate strength and power. What should and shouldn&rsquo;t women do with their body language? </p><p> Here are some tips for women on how they can use body language to be more powerful from the <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Science of People  </u> </a> :</p><h3> DON&rsquo;T:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Don&rsquo;t Bobblehead</h3><p> <br/> A common body language mistake women make is to over-nod. This happens during conversations when a woman wants to show agreement or congeniality and nods as the other person speaks. From afar this looks a bit like a bobblehead doll. While it can show friendliness, it is also the sign of a pushover. So be sure to nod only when you really agree with someone, not by default.</p><h3> 2. Don&rsquo;t Fake Smile</h3><p> <br/> Women have been taught from a young age to &lsquo;smile and nod&rsquo; while in conversation in order to be likeable. The problem is, fake smiling is not only a sign of weakness, but also disingenuous. Instead of plastering a smile on your face, save your pearly whites for when you first meet someone and when you actually find something agreeable. This will make people appreciate your gorgeous grin.</p><h3> 3. Don&rsquo;t Peer Over Your Glasses</h3><p> <br/> Judge Judy&rsquo;s signature move is to peer over her glasses disdainfully at the people in her courtroom. Nonverbally this is a cue of superiority and scorn. If you wear glasses try not to peer over them at people. It makes you look distant and snobby!</p><h3> 4. Don&rsquo;t Self-Touch</h3><p> <br/> When women are nervous they tend to tuck their hair behind their ears or fiddle with their jewelry. These are low confidence gestures. Women also toss their hair or touch their neck when flirting because it exposes the armpit, which releases sex hormones, shows the curvature of the neck and highlights shiny healthy hair. You do NOT want to do this in a business situation because it is the opposite of showing professional power.</p><h3> 5. Don&rsquo;t Wrist Pop</h3><p> <br/> Women love to stand with one hip popped out or a wrist popped out to the side. Oddly, a limp wrist or exposed wrists are a sign of submission and both women and homosexual men tend to do this subconsciously when they are in a room with people they want to attract. This is why while smoking, many women hold the cigarette with one wrist turned out and exposed. If you want to show power, don&rsquo;t expose your wrists.</p><h3> 6. Don&rsquo;t Point</h3><p> <br/> Be careful not to point at people or up in the air while making points. It often triggers people&rsquo;s memories of a school marm or nagging mom. If you want to gesture while you speak use an open palm or the a-ok thumb to index finger gesture. These are both positive nonverbal cues and help you look more approachable and confident.</p><h3> Do&rsquo;s:</h3><h3> <br/> 7. Point Your Feet</h3><p> <br/> The feet serve as a direct reflection of a person&rsquo;s attitude. When the feet are pointed directly toward another person, this is a sign of genuine interest. If, on the other hand, the feet are pointed away or towards the exit, this means that person is thinking about leaving more than talking to you. When speaking with people in positions of power be sure to point your feet towards them because it shows them you are engaged and respectful.</p><h3> 8. Claim Your Territory</h3><p> <br/> When women want to be assertive they can stand with their feet spread further apart. This &lsquo;claiming of territory&rsquo; is a subconscious cue to men that you are feeling confident. When women are nervous, they tend to take up as little space as possible &mdash; crossing their legs and tucking their arms into the chair or folding them over their chest, but this looks weak. When you walk into a room, be confident in your movements, don&rsquo;t tuck in your legs, cross your arms or turtle your shoulders. This makes you look powerful and strong.</p><h3> 9. Carry One Item</h3><p> <br/> Studies have shown that people who carry more than one item &mdash; like a purse and a briefcase or a briefcase and a coat are perceived to be less organized and more forgetful. So, before going into a meeting or event be sure to consolidate your bags, leave extra things in the car and give your coat to the receptionist to hang so you do not have to carry it into the room.</p><h3> 10. Steeple</h3><p> <br/> Steepling is when someone brings their hands up in front of their chest and presses the tips of their fingers together. This is a gesture of confidence and self-assuredness. This can easily be done to inspire confidence in yourself and others before or during a meeting or event.</p><p> Overall, you want to make sure that your body language is aligned with your words. If you are telling people you are confident, show confidence. Body language can give you a nonverbal edge in your interactions.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Rick Hyde </u> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TicoonTech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ticoon Technology  </u> </a>  </p><p> Fasten your seat belts if you&rsquo;re in the business of distributing financial products and services. You&rsquo;re about to experience some severe turbulence. </p><p> Digital technology is not only transforming how we communicate and stay informed, it is also reinventing how we shop and purchase products and services &ndash; including financial products and advice. To better understand what lies ahead, let&rsquo;s take a brief look at some industries that are further along in this digital transformation. </p><h3> Music Stores and Travel Agents </h3><p> <br/> Remember when the music industry digitized music distribution? We used to buy our records and cassettes, then our CDs, at retail music stores such as  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMV\" target=\"_blank\">   HMV  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Records\" target=\"_blank\">   Tower Records  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://torontoist.com/2007/11/lights_out_for/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Music World  </a> </u> . Now, we buy our music online at  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ca/itunes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   iTunes  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/music/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Amazon  </a> </u>  or we subscribe to one of a growing number of  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_on-demand_streaming_music_services\" target=\"_blank\">   music streaming services  </a> </u> . The traditional retail music distributors are no longer needed in order to find music to listen to.</p><p> Remember when the travel industry opened up online booking to travelers? We used to buy our airline tickets and make hotel reservations through travel agents. Now, we book our own flights through  <u>  <a href=\"http://aircanada.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AirCanada.com  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://westjet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Westjet.com  </a> </u>  and we shop online for hotels and rental cars then book the best rates through a growing number of online travel sites. No one needs a travel agent to book their travel anymore, though specialized travel consultants can add value in some situations.</p><p> So, when technology and financial services companies start offering self-serve tools to investors, borrowers and customers so they can buy products, manage their investments and even borrow money, who do you think is going to lose out?</p><p> You will. </p><p> The advisors, agents, and sales reps, along with the distribution organizations, that inhabit the market space between the end client and the large financial product manufacturers will feel the squeeze &ndash; and you will find yourself under increased pressure to define your value differently.</p><h3> \"The Less a Business Changed in the Past 30 Years, the More It's About to Change.\" </h3><p> <br/> Financial services are merely the latest in a series of industries that are being reinvented by digital technological innovation. </p><p> Widespread internet connectivity combined with wireless mobile tools and new modes of social interaction are producing innovative products &ndash; and entirely new business models. And this is all happening at an increasingly rapid pace. New market entrants, such as technology companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, are looking for ways to leverage their online success and massive customer bases to penetrate the markets and distribution channels of traditional financial companies, such as banks and insurance companies.</p><p> A growing financial technology (&ldquo;fintech&rdquo;) sector is focused on making financial services better, faster and cheaper for consumers by applying the following types of strategies:  </p><li> <strong>  Automation </strong>  &ndash; Repetitive tasks that can be automated with software and &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; algorithms drives down the cost of providing a service. The so-called robo-advisor is one such example, a service that automates key aspects of portfolio management. </li><li> <strong>  Self-service </strong>  &ndash; Customers are accustomed having access to online self-service tools and like to be in control of their finances, which reduces the need for staff and physical locations to serve customers. Virtually every fintech start-up today has a mobile app. </li><li> <strong>  Direct distribution </strong>  &ndash; The more a financial services company can directly service a customer, the less they need to spend on supporting the infrastructure of agents, advisors, offices, branches and/or other distribution partners. Crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending start-ups match funders/lenders with borrowers, without the involvement of traditional lending institutions.  <br/>  </li><p> Each of these strategies contributes to driving costs down, while offering more value and greater service to consumers. </p><h3> Four Strategies to Get Ready for the FinTech Future</h3><p> <br/> As traditional financial services companies, new market entrants, and the fintech vanguard rush to cut distributors out and reinvent the business model of financial services, what is an advisor or a financial products distribution business to do? </p><p> Here are a few strategies that you would be well-advised to embrace in this brave new world: </p><li> <strong>  Focus on client relationships and how you can add value </strong>  &ndash; Human advisors have one advantage over technological competitors: you&rsquo;re human. You understand your clients (as human beings with human needs and concerns) and you have a relationship with them. That is a beachhead on which you can build lasting value in your business. However, if your business is highly transactional and you touch a large number of clients very superficially, now is the time to re-examine that model.  </li><li> <strong>  Embrace technology </strong>  &ndash; There is no denying that consumer technology (eg., smartphones, mobile devices, wearable computing, etc.) is changing our expectations about the role of technology in many areas of our life. Your clients will increasingly expect you to offer real-time online reporting and transactional support that they are accustomed to receiving from other service providers. And they will expect to see you in the social networks in which they are spending their time. Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of thinking you can focus on the human elements of your business at the expense of keeping up with technological trends that are reinventing commerce.</li><li> <strong>  Leverage your data </strong>  &ndash; Every business has valuable data about its clients. This data can be as simple as knowing where they live and work or what stage of life they are in. Accessing this data opens up many opportunities to serve clients better while driving growth in your business. The future of your business and your ability to really take care of your clients in this technological age will depend on your ability to track and leverage basic client behaviours and corresponding data.</li><li> <strong>  Develop partnerships </strong>  &ndash; As business models change, businesses need to evolve as well. There are very few businesses these days that can afford not to adapt to changing conditions. Partnerships are one of the best adaptive strategies because they can be deployed quickly and are highly flexible. Start by choosing business vendors that act like business partners and help you adapt.  Then, find partners that enhance your value proposition and enable you to take care of your clients better by meeting more of their needs. </li>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: John Gilfeather</p><p> I&rsquo;m a tea drinker, so the whole Starbucks experience is a bit of a mystery to me.  I have never learned SSL (Starbucks as a Second Language) and I still ask for a small or medium tea, because I don&rsquo;t know the difference between tall and grande.  The only concession I&rsquo;ve made to SSL is to order Awake tea in the morning because, if you ask for black tea or breakfast tea, you are likely to get Earl Grey &ndash; which, to me, is an afternoon tea. (I can be as fussy as the coffee drinkers.) </p><p> Starbucks also does a good job with muffins and scones, although it is best not to look at the nutritional information on the scones.  Like spaghetti carbonara, blueberry scones are a once a year indulgence.</p><p> Although I am not a frequent Starbucks customer, I am an avid Starbucks fan because Howard Schultz, founder and CEO, is very smart as a marketer and as an employer.  The latest evidence is in this article in the <a href=\"https://news.starbucks.com/news/the-atlantic-cover-story-can-starbucks-save-the-middle-class\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Atlantic  </u> </a> , which Lilah Koski shared with me. </p><p> To make a (very long) story short, Starbucks and the Arizona State University have created a program to help Starbucks employees finish college.  Schultz realizes than being a barista is not a lifelong ambition.  Through solid research among his employees, he discovered that many had started college, but most had not &ndash; for a multitude of reasons &ndash; been able to finish.  The program offers discounts for employees to get started or continue in college and provides free tuition for the final two years.</p><p> And there is ample financial and educational counseling available, along with learning coaches, to provide support. </p><h3> Is this paternalistic?  Is this a publicity stunt? </h3><p> <br/> Read the article and make up your mind.  My take is that this program is yet another big visionary idea from Howard Schultz.  But don&rsquo;t ask me if it is tall or grande.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> You may have seen  <a href=\"http://nextshark.com/why-this-student-got-into-every-ivy-league-school-and-accepted-none-of-them/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this piece </a>  in the news recently: Ronald Nelson, a Tennessee high school student, was accepted to all eight Ivy League universities. And he turned them all down, deciding on the University of Alabama instead. His reasoning? He didn&rsquo;t want to take on the burden of college debt as an undergrad. While the Ivy League schools had offered him some level of financial aid, the University of Alabama offered Nelson a full ride&mdash;and he decided to jump at the opportunity.</p><p> As interviewers commented over the weekend, Nelson&rsquo;s decision is stunning to many. It shines a spotlight on the exorbitant cost of college tuition in the US, which continues to rise faster than inflation. But his decision also says a lot about this young man&rsquo;s understanding of money. When he looked at the long term, he took into account his plans to attend medical school, and the additional cost of his education down the road. He took the emotion out of the decision (I can&rsquo;t even imagine the pressure he felt to say yes to Stanford, John Hopkins, NYU, among others) and focused on his ultimate goal: starting his career with as little debt as possible.</p><p> The story speaks to the need for families and individuals of every age to understand &ldquo;good debt&rdquo; versus &ldquo;bad debt,&rdquo; and the importance of balancing the expected return on an investment with the burden of the debt itself.</p><h3> The upside of debt</h3><p> <br/> While even the word &ldquo;debt&rdquo; can cause most of us to cringe, there really is such as thing as gooddebt. Good debt helps build wealth&mdash;not deplete it&mdash;and works over time to help you increase your net worth. Of course, no investment comes with a guarantee, but these top three examples most often result in asset growth, at least over the long term:</p><li> <strong>  College Education: </strong> It&rsquo;s no mystery that greater education leads to greater earnings potential, which is why investing in higher education is generally considered good debt. But as  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-13/college-tuition-in-the-u-s-again-rises-faster-than-inflation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  tuition costs continue to outpace inflation </a> , college-bound students may be wise to take a lesson from Ronald Nelson. He is still working toward his goal of medical school, but he&rsquo;s accomplishing that goal at a much lower cost than if he&rsquo;d chosen one of the Ivy Leagues. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Real Estate: </strong>  Buying a home is often the primary goal for 20- and 30-somethings. And while such an investment doesn&rsquo;t always pay off (talk to anyone who found themselves &ldquo;underwater&rdquo; after the last housing crash), in most cases, owning a home for 15-30 years results in a significant profit. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Investing: </strong> Again, long-term is the key. Sure, some people get lucky on a short-term stock purchase that they happen to buy low and sell high, but the more trusted approach to building wealth is investing over many years in a market that, at least to date, has consistently gone up over time. Yes, bear markets happen, but so do bull markets, and the bulls seem to always win in the end. <br/>  </li><p> <img alt=\"b2ap3_thumbnail_DJ-history.png\" src=\"https://newkleinadvisors.advisorproducts.com/images/easyblog_images/705/b2ap3_thumbnail_DJ-history.png\"/></p><p> Dow Jones Industrial Average - 1900-Present</p><h3> The downside of debt</h3><p> <br/> While there are no guarantees on the return of good debt, bad debt has no upside. Yes, there are certain living expenses we all must make&mdash;including some of the big-ticket items listed below&mdash;but the key is to manage that debt as much as possible. Be rational, not emotional, and make choices that reflect your own budget (even your neighbors may not really be able to afford that luxury car, even if it&rsquo;s sitting in their garage!). Here are some examples of bad debt: </p><li> <strong>  Credit Cards:  </strong> While it&rsquo;s important to build your credit over time&mdash;and using credit cards is often the primary vehicle for this goal&mdash;living beyond your means and increasing your credit card debt may very well be the worst possible &ldquo;bad debt.&rdquo; Beware of &ldquo;no interest&rdquo; cards that falsely allow you to view credit as &ldquo;free money.&rdquo; While compound interest is good for investors, it is exponentially bad to debtors. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Cars: </strong>  Yes, most of us need a car (especially in Southern California!). But remember, you arenot what you drive. Cars are both a necessity and a major acquisition. Try to keep emotion out of the decision and do your homework. Remember that driving your own car for just one more year can be a profitable decision. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Stuff: </strong>  Items like furniture, clothing, and appliances may be necessities, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should take on debt to pay for them. Making a budget and sticking to it, or saving up for that beautiful new sofa instead of financing it, can keep your level of bad debt to a minimum. <br/>  </li><p> Ultimately, managing debt is a balancing game, and I expect every one of us could learn a lesson from Ronald Nelson. He took a close look at his long-term goals and opted for the road less traveled, all in an effort to manage his debt. I have to wonder how his peers who are busy taking out huge loans to pay the cost of an Ivy League tuition are going to fare in comparison down the road. My guess: Ronald Nelson is going to excel at more than just medicine in years to come.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Thoughtful client feedback is always illuminating. Of course, you have to be careful about taking what just one client executive says works or doesn&rsquo;t work when it comes to building long-term relationships, and generalize it to all clients. But, having interviewed over 1000 senior executives on this topic, it&rsquo;s remarkable to me how consistent the messages are.</p><p> Last week I interviewed a senior IT executive at a workshop I was running for a client of mine. Here are some of the highlights of what he said about &ldquo;building relationships from the client&rsquo;s side of the desk.&rdquo;</p><h3> A Client&rsquo;s Perspective: <br/> Eight Things to Remember <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Never come to me and simply tell me about a problem you&rsquo;re seeing in our organization. </strong> Tell me how you think we can fix it.</li><li> <strong>  Push back. </strong> If you think there&rsquo;s a different or better approach, tell us! We really do want to hear it.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t give us printed materials </strong> that aren&rsquo;t completely professional (it happens often!)</li><li> <strong>  In a first meeting with a prospective client, don&rsquo;t be overly familiar. </strong> Be warm and friendly, but don&rsquo;t act like we&rsquo;re already friends.</li><li> <strong>  Even in an RFP, you can distinguish yourself. </strong> In your response, give us your best thinking about some tough issues we or our industry face&ndash;even if we didn&rsquo;t ask you for it.</li><li> <strong>  Understand your client&rsquo;s business issues </strong> but also learn about their personal challenges, goals, likes, and dislikes. You have to get to know the whole person.</li><li> <strong>  If you want to go over my head to my boss or my bosses&rsquo; boss </strong> , sit down with me and explain why. Be transparent. There may very well be an issue that deserves their attention&ndash;I understand that it happens sometimes&ndash;but collaborate with me, don&rsquo;t just go around me.</li><li> <strong>  If a client doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to have a relationship with you </strong> , it may simply be because you haven&rsquo;t found out what&rsquo;s really important to him or her. Everyone has issues they need help with&ndash;everyone has hot buttons. You need to dig deeper because then you&rsquo;ll know how to be relevant and help them. And that&rsquo;s what builds the relationship. <br/>  </li><h3> Much of this is common sense. But sometimes it seems to be uncommonly found in practice!</h3>",

    "title": "Why The Efficient Market Hypothesis is Useless",
    "link": "why-the-efficient-market-hypothesis-is-useless",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cullenroche\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Cullen Roche  </u> </a> | Orcam Financial Group</p><p> I noticed Noah Smith and John Authers on Twitter  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/603317081157738496\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   discussing how great the Efficient Market Hypothesis  </u>    </a> is because it explains why indexing works. I responded saying that the EMH really has nothing to do with why indexing works. They didn&rsquo;t seem to see my point of view so let&rsquo;s try this again and see if we can finally get this industry on a path towards understanding how incredibly silly the EMH actually is.</p><p> The original EMH stated that markets priced information efficiently. That is, if some news was released the markets would price this so that it was incredibly difficult to take advantage of this new information. This was basically a way of saying that markets work better than people who intervene in a discretionary manner. It&rsquo;s not surprising that this idea was largely developed by the Chicago School of Economics during the period of Milton Friedman&rsquo;s reign of terror because this established a theory of finance that was consistent with a theory of economics that was inherently anti government (interventionist).</p><h3> Since then, the theory of economics has basically collapsed as it&rsquo;s been proven largely false.</h3><p> <br/> Monetarism, as it was originally constructed, is no longer taken very seriously. But the theory of finance has been heralded as a great success. The banner has been carried triumphantly by Eugene Fama and others. The problem is that this theory is also collapsing (though much, much more slowly). When Fama realized that there was some unexplained outperformance in certain types of assets he had to change the EMH. EMH went from being a strong form to a semi strong to a weak form. And his factor models evolved from one factor to three to five and now there are even hundred factor versions. The original EMH is a mere shadow of its former self and no one finds it all that useful. For some reason it is still attributed as a great success in describing why active portfolio managers don&rsquo;t perform well and this still gives it credibility in many circles.</p><p> The flaw in the EMH was that it was always constructed on an ideological misunderstanding. Fama implemented hundreds of studies showing that &ldquo;active&rdquo; portfolio management didn&rsquo;t outperform indexing. This seemed to prove that discretionary intervention was unwise and Fama claimed that it showed that markets are smarter than individuals who try to intervene in markets. Except it didn&rsquo;t prove that at all. After all, all of the benchmarks he was comparing these active managers to were also actively comprised components of broader aggregates ( <u>  l  <a href=\"http://www.pragcap.com/is-the-global-financial-asset-portfolio-the-perfect-indexing-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ike the GFAP which I have explained in the past  </a> </u> ). That&rsquo;s right. The S&amp;P 500 is a slice of US stocks inside a broader aggregate of global stocks with a specific set of actively chosen criteria. The same is true of any other index. Fama was not comparing discretionary intervention to non-discretionary intervention. He was simply comparing active funds with economies of scale versus active funds without economies of scale. He was comparing low cost funds to high cost funds. This said NOTHING about how &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; the market is. It simply showed that a high cost manager will, on average, underperform a low cost manager.</p><p> Of course, this should be patently obvious to anyone who understands the arithmetic of the markets. <a href=\"http://www.pragcap.com/putting-the-underperformance-of-active-managers-in-perspective\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   As I&rsquo;ve explained before  </u>  , </a>  the financial markets are like a basketball game where the teams score an average of 100 points and are all docked 10 points by their coaches and then 20 points by the league at the end of the game. When all is said and done the average score is 70. Isn&rsquo;t that crazy? The best basketball players in the world only score 70 points relative to a 100 point benchmark! They must be terrible at basketball, right?  Of course not. This is the same for investment managers who earn 10% on average, charge 1%, incur 2% in taxes and are then compared to a pre-tax and pre-free benchmark. It&rsquo;s not surprising that they underperform on average. It&rsquo;s just math. And it says nothing about their skill level or whether their active decisions are smart or not. It just shows that the less active low friction manager will, on average, do better than the highly active high friction manager. The key point being that all portfolio construction involves active and discretionary decisions and when everyone starts using low fee and tax efficient approaches then SOMEONE must, by definition, be making smarter discretionary decisions than others which lead to better performance.</p><h3> And that&rsquo;s the big kicker here.</h3><p> <br/> The EMH doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything about the skill of the S&amp;P 500 Index Committee relative to the Fidelity Magellan fund manager. In fact, the EMH doesn&rsquo;t really tell us anything useful at all. The only thing an indexer needs to know about why they should use index funds is that costs and taxes matter.  A LOT.  More importantly, all asset allocators ultimately end up being forced to actively choose how their portfolios will be comprised even if they pick the index funds that comprise that portfolio. Using low cost index funds are very smart ways to do this, but using low cost index funds will not help you circumvent the inevitable reality that you will need to make discretionary decisions at times and you will need to use funds that were constructed by people who chose, with discretion, how those funds would be constructed.  And you will, by definition, deviate from global cap weighting which will force you into being an &ldquo;active&rdquo; asset picker.</p><p> When you understand that the EMH doesn&rsquo;t explain why indexing works then it becomes little more than a meaningless idea about why prices may or may not move when they respond to new information. It doesn&rsquo;t prove if the response to that information is &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;, rational, intelligent or ignorant. In essence, it simply says that prices react to new information, which, to be kind, is not very useful for any sort of financial or economic analysis.</p><p> While the Chicago School made many great contributions to modern finance over the last 50 years the EMH is one idea that cannot die fast enough.  It is a tired old political idea with no real use in modern finance. My hope is that, while it dies, it takes the myth of &ldquo;passive indexing&rdquo; to its grave with it. Unfortunately, given how deeply ingrained this idea is in Modern Finance, I doubt it&rsquo;s going anywhere fast.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Business owners, entrepreneurs are inundated with sage advice about being innovative from those who&rsquo;ve gone before and prospered, like:</p><p> To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men &ndash; that is genius.  ~Emerson</p><p> Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.  ~Steve jobs</p><p> Stick to your vision and tune out the naysayers.  ~Mark Zuckerberg</p><p> Life isn&rsquo;t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.  ~George Bernard Shaw</p><p> Yes, it&rsquo;s all great advice if you have the financing to be truly innovative and weather the tough times that are sure to come. Sure, it&rsquo;s easy, if you&rsquo;re a genius.</p><p> What I&rsquo;d like to suggest is this:  yes, innovation is a big part of business success, but don&rsquo;t dismiss the other key ingredients:  excellence and imitation.</p><h3> What do we mean? </h3><p> <br/> Okay, excellence is simply doing things as well as it can be done. For example, Malcolm Gladwell (The Outliers) reminded us about the amount of hours, 10,000 in fact, were required to become a &ldquo;master&rdquo; at something (after years of performing at local clubs, night after night, the group known as the Beatles was masters of playing music and writing songs).  They were not, as we were led to believe, an overnight sensation.</p><p> I&rsquo;m reminded of a class exercise decades ago that featured a mix of students in Ph.D. and MBA business programs alongside experienced business executives. The topic of recruiting talent came up, and after listening to numerous academic theories, an executive said, &ldquo;When we need talent, we just hire people who have been well trained but are frustrated at (other companies).  We get the best people, (and) they are dying for greater opportunities.&rdquo;</p><h3> Similarly, innovation is not as easy as it seems given the genius or special skills of these innovators. </h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;re also too proud to acknowledge our own limitations, and may believe that our amazingly new idea may not seem so to the buying market.  And, since business is typically a collaborate enterprise, desirable qualities like &ldquo;teamwork&rdquo; and &ldquo;cooperation&rdquo; can inhibit the innovative mind.</p><h3> And, let&rsquo;s not knock imitation. </h3><p> <br/> Many business successes have arisen from the franchise method.  Compare the notion of opening up an established pizza chain with your own original pizza parlor with recipes gathered from family, friends and maybe cable TV shows.  Or, would it be easier to open up your own hamburger palace from scratch, without an apparent &ldquo;identity,&rdquo; versus a well-known name?</p><li> <strong>  Reinventing the wheel:  </strong> sometimes you shouldn&rsquo;t when tried and true methods are available.  Areas like accounting, legal matters, quality of product, customer service, marketing and operations.</li><li> <strong>  Aim for excellence in all business matters: </strong> Ben Franklin said,&rdquo; A great idea without execution is hallucination.&rdquo;  Striving for innovation may mean losing sight of excellence.  How can you achieve excellence, if you&rsquo;re still learning the nuts and bolts of your business?  Losing sight of customer service, for example, while you&rsquo;re being a &ldquo;pioneer&rdquo; in your field, may be the biggest blunder you could make.</li><li> <strong>  I also argue a company and in particular small companies can differentiate in other areas other than simple product characteristics. </strong> The most evident example is internet retailing accompanied with international sourcing that has revolutionized many industries. <br/>  </li><p> In summary, while innovation is clearly the backbone of growing a business, increasing market share and profits, it needs the support and inclusion of imitation and excellence where it matters most.  And, knowing when to focus on each of these qualities, is where true business wisdom lies.</p>",

No matter how you define Conflict of Interest, Conflicts have become a buzz phrase by financial regulators. It seems as if you can&rsquo;t read a new rule, regulation or enforcement action and not find a reference to Conflicts of Interest.</p><p> Andrew Bowden, Head of the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, has stated that his No. 1 piece of advice for firms is to decide their ethical standard, and there is no law that directly addresses ethics. He went on to state that the overwhelming majority of people in the industry are trying to do the right thing in a competitive, complex environment, however in regard to  <u>  Conflicts of Interest </u> , there can be good people trying to do the right thing that can be blinded and convince themselves that they are in the right &ndash; no one is immune to conflict. Conflicts of Interest will remain one of the top priorities of the SEC in 2015.</p><p> In addition, Conflicts of Interest is one of the five main areas that contribute to compliance and supervisory breakdowns in  <u>  FINRA&rsquo;s 2015 Regulatory and Examinations Priority Letter </u> . FINRA goes on to say, Conflicts of Interest are a contributing factor to many regulatory actions FINRA (and other regulators) have taken&hellip;&rdquo; FINRA emphasized the importance of firms moving to identify and mitigate Conflicts of Interest.</p><p> The CFTC as well has now implemented specific regulations regarding Conflicts of Interest for Swap Dealers. The Conflicts of Interest rules require additional disclosures of potential Conflicts of Interest and separation of certain business units. Specifically, the rules require that research analysts are separate from non-research personnel and that clearing functions are separate from affiliated business trading units.</p><p> What is clear, other than the regulatory focus, is that firms need to proactively address and mitigate known Conflicts of Interest. In addition, firms should take steps to identify Conflicts that may not be easily identifiable. By undertaking a Conflicts of Interest Review firms are headed in the right direction of creating an ethical standard &ndash; as well as creating a Culture of Compliance within the Front Office. A Conflicts of Interest review should include a business unit review and policy and procedure review.</p><h3> Conflicts of Interest</h3><p> <br/> The business unit review should incorporate business unit meetings including senior business unit management, business unit compliance representatives, senior compliance representatives and legal. The meeting agenda should include a discussion of each of the types of conflicts identified by FINRA and whether or not those conflicts exist within the business, and if so how the conflicts are mitigated.</p><p> The policy and procedure review would include: compliance policies, procedures, training, and compliance forms (such as outside business activities). This portion of the Conflicts Review would consider whether identified conflicts as well as prohibited and restricted conflicts are covered within relevant policies and procedures.</p>",

    "link": "your-brand-ethics-and-values-walk-the-talk",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Do you do much thinking about the ethics and values of your company on a daily basis? Do you talk about it with your employees? Most people don&rsquo;t. They assume since it&rsquo;s mentioned in the &ldquo;about&rdquo; page of the company website or in their marketing materials, that it&rsquo;s something people know about them &mdash; that it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;given.&rdquo; </p><p> That&rsquo;s wrong for two reasons&hellip; first, <strong>  we should never &ldquo;assume&rdquo; anything when it comes to people and knowledge. </strong> Assumptions always lead to miscommunication down the line. Second, <strong>  your company&rsquo;s ethics and values are something that must be lived by everyone in your company on a daily basis before they can be experienced by your customers, vendors and partners. </strong> Therefore, you and your employees (all of them) need to be crystal clear about what those values are and how they apply to every business practice. Why? Because the outside world looks at the way the people in your organization behave and makes judgements about your company&rsquo;s worthiness based on what they see and experience for themselves. When there&rsquo;s a disconnect between what you say, you believe and what you actually put into practice, things start to fall apart.</p><p> I read something the other day on LinkedIn by Christopher Bauer on company ethics that really brings home this point. </p><p> &ldquo;It is not your claims about ethics and values that will differentiate you. Rather, it is the uniqueness, clarity, and influence of your values on the way in which you run your department, division, or entire organization that will differentiate you so powerfully.&rdquo;</p><p> He&rsquo;s absolutely right. When those values become ingrained in the culture of your company and everyone does their work through that lens, your values become transparent to everyone who comes in contact with your people. Those behaviors are the building blocks of trust &mdash; and the reverse is also true.</p><p> <img alt=\"tedrubin-brandethics\" src=\"http://themarketingscope.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tedrubin-brandethics.jpg\"/> <br/> <br/> How many times have we seen evidence of this in the digital space? You see it every day with political figures who say they stand for something and then behave in a totally different manner. Airlines are another example. When what the public experiences is something contrary to their mission statement, that experience gets shared and trust disappears quickly.</p><p> Let me emphasize the words &ldquo;shared&rdquo; and &ldquo;experience&rdquo; here. <strong>  Digital communication has lightning-speed effect on your brand reputation, good or bad, because people are going to share their experiences with others. </strong> There&rsquo;s no getting around it. All companies live in glass houses today. So why not influence those experiences at a grass-roots level?</p><p> <strong>  Ensure that everyone in your company knows how to conduct their work with your ethics and values uppermost in mind. </strong> Write it down. Talk it out. Train them constantly, so those values become habit. Sure, some people will make mistakes. We&rsquo;re all human, but <strong>  it&rsquo;s how the public sees you deal with those mistakes that makes the difference (because that&rsquo;s transparent too). </strong></p><p> Listen. People are going to make judgements about your company. That&rsquo;s a given. However, you have the power to influence those judgements by changing the way you do business. When everyone walks the talk in your company, from the TOP down, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about your reputation in the marketplace. Your values will shine through your people.</p><p> <strong>  A &ldquo;Brand&rdquo; is what a business does&hellip; a &ldquo;Reputation&rdquo; is what people remember and share. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> During my days in the academy, I had the extraordinary honour and good fortune to interact (at some level or another) with some ten thousand undergraduate and graduate students. It is a rush when, while walking along a downtown street, a former student yells out to me to stop so they can share the story of their career so far. Indeed, these days I get emails and LinkedIn updates from former students who are now around the globe.</p><p> Every speech, every class, every conversation, was and is truly enjoyable. One particular group discussion always stands out in my mind. That conversation is one that happened almost every year with first year undergraduate commerce students, where I shared with them my life experiences in the capital markets industry. One of the points that I emphasized was that you can make a good living, but don&rsquo;t do it for the money. Invariably, at the end of my talk, at least one student would ask,</p><h3> &ldquo;How much money can you make?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> I don&rsquo;t blame them for asking this question. For one thing, the income one makes is a mark of success in an industry where, at the end of every day, you know whether you&rsquo;re on the right side or the wrong side of a transaction from a profit perspective. To say that the capital markets industry is competitive is the understatement of the decade. Sadly, though, this drive for income &lsquo;dominance&rsquo; can lead to the worst kind of hubris. I have met, and I am sure you have too, one or two folks who made good money and every year spent one dollar more than they made&mdash;on themselves.</p><p> But here is the secret to how to make more money than you ever imagined. Stop focussing on the money! Focus on your clients. In an industry where everyone is debating the issue of a duty of best interest, my advice is to reach as far beyond such a threshold as you can possibly imagine. Start with ensuring symmetry of information and then move on to laying your &lsquo;forever&rsquo; reputation on every client interaction.</p><p> In my early life as a business executive, my lawyer taught me this lesson. It was the first big piece of legal work that I needed to have done. My lawyer did the work and sent me his invoice&mdash;a big invoice! I called him and said that I was having trouble with his fee. He walked me through it, but at the end said, &ldquo;Paul, pay me what you think the work was worth.&rdquo; He was my corporate counsel for the rest of my career and is a close friend today&mdash;some thirty years later&mdash;and he made good money from our firm.</p><h3> There&rsquo;s one thing that always precedes making a good living&mdash;trust!</h3>",

    "content": "<p> A while back I read the book &ldquo;Lean In&rdquo; by Sheryl Sandberg. I can&rsquo;t remember the last business book that so reached into my heart and connected with my soul.</p><p> As an INTJ &mdash; and female! &mdash; I&rsquo;m already practically an endangered species. Only 0.8% of women in the world are INTJ. Add factors such as being a young(ish) leader, a business owner, and working for years in a very male-dominated church environment &ndash; and it&rsquo;s impossible not to be aware of the limitations placed on smart, driven women.</p><p> Sheryl deftly articulated so many gender-driven experiences to which I can excruciatingly relate.</p><li> Being interrupted and talked over by men who make a point to listen to each other respectfully? ✔️</li><li> Down-playing intelligence to gain social popularity? ✔️</li><li> Phrasing instructions as questions to increase perceived likability? ✔️</li><li> Accepting lower pay &amp; contract work while watching my equal male colleagues receive competitive salaries, benefits &amp; promotions? ✔️</li><li> Refraining from negotiation for fear of losing a good opportunity? ✔️</li><li> Acting like I don&rsquo;t know the answer so no one will think I&rsquo;m &ldquo;too smart&rdquo;? ✔️</li><li> Asking an agreeable male classmate to act as spokesperson even though I was designated &ldquo;team leader&rdquo;, because everyone listened better when a guy said it, and rationalizing that it was easier than bucking the stereotypical norm? ✔️ <br/>  </li><p> For me, it started my junior year of high school. I attended private boarding school that year, and quickly realized that naked academic ambition was going to directly &mdash; and negatively &mdash; affect my potential for social acceptance.</p><p> My previous educational environment had fostered a deep love of learning and shameless pursuit of knowledge. But I quickly realized that girls were most popular when they concerned themselves primarily with shallower pursuits, and any overtly eager approach to my studies would bring certain social ostracization and accompanying unflattering nicknames like &ldquo;know-it-all&rdquo;, &ldquo;bossy&rdquo;, and &ldquo;kiss-up&rdquo;.</p><p> So I played dumb.</p><p> Feigned ignorance.</p><p> Kept my hand down when I knew I knew the answer.</p><p> Refrained from asking questions when I wanted to know the answer.</p><p> Looking back, I&rsquo;m certain I lost a few IQ points as a result. In a stage of growth when I could have accelerated academically and challenged myself mentally, I consciously chose to play dumb instead.</p><p> <strong>  Because I wanted to fit in. </strong></p><p> Because I was scared of the labels that come with breaking gender stereotypes. Because no one except my parents told me it was okay to be unashamed of however smart God had made me, and that I shouldn&rsquo;t have to hide a love of learning. And what do parents know? (Just kidding. I should have listened to them instead of worrying about popularity. But time brings clarity teenagers rarely possess.)</p><p> It took years to recoup what my soul lost while striving to become a &ldquo;good submissive girl&rdquo;. In other words, while trying to be invisible.</p><p> It wasn&rsquo;t until my tiny, mewling firstborn child was laid in my arms that I broke free. Suddenly I didn&rsquo;t care what anyone thought. Life had greater purpose than merely pleasing petty onlookers.</p><p> Some feminists might raise their hackles, but I found freedom in motherhood &mdash; which then spilled over into every other category of life. How could I raise my son to value authenticity if his mother dumbed herself down to be socially accepted? How could I teach him to treasure and respect women if I modeled insecurity and self-doubt?</p><p> Like Sheryl Sandberg, I feel like an imposter some days. I still wonder when someone will unmask me as a fraud.</p><p> But I also have grown to acknowledge that talents and experience do not exist to be buried. I&rsquo;ve come to peace with the realization that social popularity for its&rsquo; own sake is highly overrated.</p><p> Most of all, I&rsquo;ve learned <strong>  there&rsquo;s no lasting value to anyone that results from teaching smart girls to play dumb. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> An illustration of your client process can show prospects how you&rsquo;re different and help get them excited about working with you.</p><p> One of the steps in our  <u>  referral marketing coaching process </u>  is developing a graphic that illustrates your process of working with clients. We find that it can be a powerful tool in moving people along in making the decision to make you their advisor. Among the benefits of a process graphic are:</p><li> Setting expectations for what will happen if someone decides to become a client </li><li> Demonstrate how your special expertise is reflected in the client experience</li><li> Illustrate how comprehensive or thorough your service is</li><li> Include mystery items to stimulate further conversation about what you do for clients <br/>  </li><p> A process graphic might illustrate the whole lifespan of a client relationship. Picture the illustration of the financial planning process. It starts with setting goals and progresses through monitoring the plan at which point it loops back on itself and starts over again. I believe it can be more powerful to have a graphic that addresses only the initial stages of your relationship. Clients want to know what to expect if they begin working with you &ndash; not necessarily the service model that you will employ over the long term but rather the more intensive engagement that typically happens at the beginning of a relationship.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.theclientdrivenpractice.com/storage/The%20Financial%20Planning%20Process.gif?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1432172297881\"/></p><p> One of the most common frustrations I hear from financial advisors who do financial planning is <strong>  the challenge of getting clients to produce the documents and information they need to complete the initial financial plan. </strong> Sometimes, showing the client the light at the end of the tunnel can help motivate them to take care of the steps necessary to wrap up that initial stage of the relationship.</p><p> Many firms lay out their process in text in a brochure or on their website. <strong>  Pictures are more powerful. They are also more engaging. </strong> You can more easily help your clients understand the discrete steps in your onboarding process with a graphic.</p><p> <strong>  Limit the number of words you use in the graphic. </strong> Think of it as a way to facilitate conversation rather than to be a standalone explanation of your client process.</p><p> Include specialized or technical terms that would be familiar to your target market. We are currently working with a client whose niche is assisting faculty in a specific university system make the most out of the special opportunities they have for maximizing their retirement savings and customizing distributions. Several steps in their process graph make specific reference to the particular benefits plans they have available, even using the initials or abbreviations of those plans. Using that &ldquo;inside information&rdquo; is a great way of communicating to faculty members that they have a special expertise in the opportunities unique to them.</p><p> Sometimes including something cryptic can be a great way to get people to ask more questions about what you do. One of our clients has an exercise they take clients through where they separate the different streams of retirement income into &ldquo;buckets.&rdquo; The bucket analogy is not particularly unique. However, their client advisory board made it clear that that particular exercise was perceived as particularly helpful and valuable. So when we help them create their process graphic, one of the steps had pictures of several pails with &ldquo;financial planning and buckets&rdquo; underneath it. No explanation. When they show it to prospective clients, it is very common for people to point at that part of the graphic and ask about it. The advisor gets permission to have a longer conversation about that tool. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.theclientdrivenpractice.com/storage/buckets.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1432173177305\"/></p><p> Drafting ideas for a graphic is easy using something like WordArt in Microsoft Word. Include enough steps to make clear your expertise or the special elements that make your client experience unique. Once you are satisfied with the number of steps, what you will call them, and the flow of the graphic, higher a graphic artist to create an illustration for you. This will be one of the first things prospective clients will see about your practice so you want it to look professional.</p><p> Once you have a draft from the artist, test it with your clients or bring it to your  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/client-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   client advisory board  </a> </u> . Find out from them if they believe the graphic is an accurate representation of the experience of working with you. Make sure you have included as separate steps those aspects of your process that clients believe make you or your process unique. Ask their opinions of the icons or illustrations you have chosen for each step.</p><p> Client feedback can be especially helpful in discussing the pictures you use in your graphic. Finding icons to illustrate the separate steps of your process that are not clich&eacute; can be really hard. One of our clients had &ldquo;setting mutual expectations&rdquo; as the first step in the process and we set out to find a picture to illustrate it. One of the first ideas was two hands shaking. We quickly threw out that idea. But finding something graphic to illustrate the idea has been a real challenge. For now, we have settled on a drawing of the Dickens book &ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo; but the client advisory board told us we need something better.</p><p> Once complete, <strong>  you can post the graphic to your website, include in a brochure, or have it as a flyer or in a PowerPoint for presentation to prospective clients. </strong></p><p> Part of the hesitation people have in becoming clients is fear of the unknown. How long will this take? How much work am I going to have to do? <strong>  A process graph is one great way of giving prospects a preview of your client experience and will help them fill in the blanks of what is involved in your onboarding process. </strong> When done well it presents them an overview of your new client experience that can help them get excited about the outcome. It provides them something they can describe to their friends when they refer you. Understanding your process, feeling some familiarity with it, can help smooth the way for those prospects to become clients.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  In your Client Experience work, do you focus on the big picture or just on the task at hand? </strong> <br/> <br/> At the  <a href=\"http://cxpa.site-ym.com/?page=2015_IE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CXPA Insight Exchange </a>  in San Diego a couple weeks ago, the keynote speaker for the first day of the event was Derrick Hall, President and CEO of the Arizona Diamondbacks. I wasn't really sure what to expect; was this going to be another Moneyball-type speech? Nope. It was far from that! He made us laugh, and he made us cry. He was a great storyteller and quite inspirational. <br/> <br/> One of the stories he told was worthy of sharing because I think it makes such a great point. It reminds us of a trap that I think many companies fall into: \"small-picture thinking\" or \"in-the-moment thinking.\" They get so lost in what they're doing that they forget why they're doing it.</p><h3> Here's the story...</h3><p> <br/> A man came upon a construction site where three people were working.  He asked the first worker, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; and the man replied: &ldquo;I'm laying bricks.&rdquo; He asked the second worker, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; The man said: &ldquo;I'm building a wall.&rdquo; As he approached the third, he heard him humming a tune as he worked and asked, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; The man stood up, looked at the sky, and smiled, &ldquo;I'm building a cathedral.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Sometimes we get so focused on the tasks that we're doing, all the little tactical things, that we forget about the big picture, what it's all for. What's the outcome? What are we trying to achieve overall? <br/> <br/> That story reminded me of a couple of quotes: <br/> <br/> <strong>  People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole. -Theodore Levitt  </strong> <br/> <br/> <strong>  If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses. -Henry Ford  </strong></p><h3> I think you can look at the bricklayer story from two different angles:</h3><p> <br/> 1. The customer perspective:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/06/do-customers-know-what-they-need.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Does the customer really know what he needs  </a> </u> ? It's less about what he needs than it is about what job he is trying to do. To improve the experience, to meet customer expectations, we must first understand what the customer is trying to achieve (he's trying to make a quarter-inch hole). Then and only then can we design and deliver a better solution. <br/> <br/> 2. The company perspective: As we go about developing and executing on our customer experience strategies, we need to remember the big picture. While we're fixing processes and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/02/journeys-not-touchpoints.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   touchpoints here and there  </a> </u> , we must remember to connect that to the over-arching objectives: to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/06/what-is-purpose-of-business.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   create and nurture customers  </a> </u>  and to deliver a great experience at every touchpoint along the journey, for the life of the relationship. <br/> <br/> What's your take on the story? Is this an issue in your company? How do you inspire big-picture thinking in your company? <br/> <br/> <strong>  The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. The shortcut to closing a door is to bury yourself in the details. -Chuck Palahniuk </strong> <br/>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AliBechtel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ali Bechtel  </u> </a>  | <a href=\"http://editorali.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Editor Ali  </u> </a>  </p><p> Social media isn&rsquo;t just for sharing updates, posting photos and staying in touch with old friends anymore. It is also the best means of reaching a new generation of investors. In fact, nearly <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2014/03/24/nearly-half-of-investors-cant-find-their-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   90% of investors use social media  </a> </u> but half of them are unable to find their advisors online, or believe they do not use social media at all. Perhaps this is why a recent <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fa-mag.com/news/social-media-use-helps-advisors--study-says-20153.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Putnam Investments survey  </a> </u> found that the financial advisors who do use social media are &ldquo;gaining more and wealthier clients than they were even a year ago.&rdquo;</p><p> Despite the overwhelming support for jumping on the digital bandwagon, there are still advisors who choose to avoid the movement. Brian Hart, founder and president of <u>  <a href=\"http://www.flackable.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Flackable  </a> </u> , a national public relations agency serving RIAs and other small to mid-sized financial services firms, has bleak news for these late adopters. &ldquo;The Digital Age will be unforgiving to the advisors refusing to adapt to our evolving business communication landscape.&rdquo;</p><p> In the face of the exponential growth and success of social media as client lead source, why are so many advisors choosing to opt out of this sea of new business opportunity?</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;My clients are in their 40s to 70s, they don&rsquo;t use social media.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Try telling that to the more than 220 million LinkedIn users over 30. 64 percent of the network&rsquo;s <u>  <a href=\"https://press.linkedin.com/about-linkedin\" target=\"_blank\">   347 million members  </a> </u> in 200 countries are in the <u>  30 to 65+ age range </u> .  And although some of the other major social platforms are dominated by the younger market, there are still more than 43.5 million Twitter users, and 30 million Facebook users over 50.</p><p> What the advisors making this argument fail to understand is that social media is not only a way to communicate with current clients. It is, more importantly, a means of reaching a younger generation of investors who do not want to be sold to, but rather to be educated, engaged, and entertained.   And it works. Putnam Investments&rsquo; survey found that two thirds of advisors using social media indicated it helped them gain new clients.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Using social media is going to lower the perception of my brand.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> &ldquo;You want your brand to be held at a high standard, kind of like Donald Trump says. His brand is all about quality and luxury and that&rsquo;s all he wants his brand to be known for. I think advisors should follow suit.&rdquo; Don Wilde, owner and financial advisor at W Financial is <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150211/FREE/150219982/some-advisers-still-not-following-social-media-movement?CSReferrer=accessControl-investmentnews\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   not the only advisor who thinks  </a> </u> participating in social media could lower perception of their brand.</p><p> Improper use, such as flooding news feeds with promotional content, may alienate prospects but a well planned strategy can initiate new relationships and build trust and engagement.</p><p> &ldquo;The key to social selling is to elevate the online relationship to a more personal level. The mistake many advisors make is that they try to begin the sales process online. That approach is inappropriate and aggressive, and it can jeopardize any trust, credibility or rapport that&rsquo;s been established,&rdquo; says Hart. But, he says, &ldquo;The notion that any level of social media engagement will inherently lower the perception of an advisor&rsquo;s brand is an archaic point of view, far removed from the reality of our times. The fact is, advisors who take that stance are invisible to a new generation of prospective clients.&rdquo;</p><p>  When implemented correctly, a social media strategy will place businesses in front of prospective clients as a thought leader, a source of necessary information and a recognizable brand.</p><p> It also bears mentioning that the Trump Hotel Collection has accounts on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, FourSquare, Pinterest and Tumblr.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I need to stay in compliance, and it&rsquo;s too easy to make a mistake.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Working in a strictly regulated industry does require a heightened sense of awareness about what is being shared online, but it should not prevent anyone from taking advantage of new technology. Now that <u>  <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/s-e-c-clears-social-media-for-corporate-announcements/?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">   the S.E.C. is making policy changes  </a> </u> to catch up to the New Media Age, advisors can begin to relax. &ldquo;Regulatory authorities are finally coming around to this new age of business communication, and it is allowing timid advisors to finally get off the sidelines and into the game,&rdquo; explained Hart.</p><p> What advice do social-savvy advisors have for staying compliant? &ldquo;Definitely don&rsquo;t use words like &lsquo;guarantee&rsquo; in your posts and make sure you archive your social media profiles for compliance issues,&rdquo; suggests Mary Beth Storjohann, CFP and founder of <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Workable Wealth  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Start small. </strong></p><p> It is time to stop making excuses and implement a strategy. With so many platforms and different nuances of connecting correctly on each one, it can be a daunting task. Storjohann suggests starting small, spending only 15 minutes a day interacting with others and building networks. Leverage scheduling tools such as Buffer or Hootsuite to save time on content creation and utilize the time set aside each day to make connections.</p><p> <strong>  Identify the networks clients and prospective clients are most active in. </strong></p><p> Storjohann uses Twitter as a means to connect with other &ldquo;talking heads&rdquo; within the industry and to establish connections with other industry leaders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really helped to engage conversations from a Gen Y and personal financial planning perspective, and has helped to build my brand within the industry.&rdquo;</p><p> It is also &ldquo;one of the best digital channels for facilitating subtle familiarity with prospective clients and other key audiences,&rdquo; according to Hart. He also uses Twitter as a prospecting tool and source of information on competitors on behalf of his clients.  More than half of the new business leads at Flackable originate on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p><p> Facebook is the channel for a more consumer focused strategy. Participation in targeted groups has been a direct source to clients for Workable Wealth.</p><p> <strong>  Develop a targeted strategy. </strong></p><p> &ldquo;The most important thing to keep in mind is who your target audience is on each platform and ensure your content is aligned with your audience,&rdquo; advises Storjohann.</p><p> For those new to the social media scene, Hart suggests seeking help. &ldquo;These once simple networks are now vast, complex digital societies, so unless you have an in-house expert to manage these accounts, consider hiring a consultant to coach you through these new opportunities and challenges. Business won&rsquo;t just magically come to you when you open an account. It takes advanced growth and engagement strategies to generate real business results.&rdquo;</p><p> Timid advisors no longer have any excuses not to establish an online reputation. Social media not only provides a platform for connecting with current clients and establishing relationships with new ones, it also gives advisors a space to set themselves apart as thought leaders among other members of the industry. For those advisors still using these old excuses, it is time to jump on the digital bandwagon, or get left behind.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In hockey, the hat-trick is when a single player scores three times in one game. It is celebrated by fans who throw their hats out onto the rink to say, &ldquo;Job exceptionally well-done. Hats off!&rdquo; What about in your business? <strong>  What are the three things, that if done exceptionally, would constitute a result worth taking off and throwing a hat? </strong></p><p> There are certain key numbers, that when measured regularly, will indicate if it is time to take a moment to step back and celebrate an extraordinary feat. Instead of looking at the numbers just once a year, we should be celebrating these wins throughout the year. It&rsquo;s time to consider the Monthly Marketing Hat-Trick. Here are the three elements that it entails:</p><h3> The Monthly Marketing Hat-Trick</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Growing Your Exposure: </strong>  Look at your website clicks, engagement, and activity on your calls to action. Consistent growth as shown by your website analytics, with a 5-20% increase in engagement each month over the previous month is truly exceptional.</p><p> <strong>  2. Increasing Referrals: </strong>  If the appointments you put on your calendar with new prospective clients that have been referred to you increases 20% over the previous month, it is truly exceptional.</p><p> <strong>  3. Gaining a stream of new clients: </strong>  The real capper to the hat-trick, however, is if both of the above increase AND you also see a 20% increase in new clients over the previous month. Exceptional! Hats off! A real marketing hat-trick!</p><p> Although one of these three elements in a given month will not immediately lead to the other, together they serve to power your marketing engine, producing a stream of successes. Exposure and engagement lead to converting more referrals. More referrals lead to more clients. And more clients lead to the ultimate goal as well as a source of new, positive referrals.</p><p> <strong>  Find reasons to celebrate. Light the lamp! </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> What does it mean to be a good leader? Organized, confident, knowledgeable, and good listeners are some commonly listed leadership traits. All of these traits funnel into one word: self-awareness. Self-awareness is the key ingredient to any great, inclusive leader.</p><p> Self-awareness allows leaders to understand their own emotions and feelings, which allows them to understand and empathize with those around them. This is why self-aware leaders make good inclusive leaders. They are in tune with the diversity in their organizations, and they pay attention to their employees concerns if there are inclusivity problems.</p><p> Maybe you&rsquo;re reading this and thinking that you aren&rsquo;t as self-aware as you could be. Does this make you a bad leader? No. In fact, there&rsquo;s good news&mdash;it is possible that, with practice, you can be on your way to being a more self-aware, inclusive leader!</p><p> Anthony K. Tjan gives us some tips on how to better our leadership skills in his article &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/02/5-ways-to-become-more-self-aware\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 Ways to Become More Self-Aware  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  1) Meditate. </strong>  Taking the time to think about your actions and living in the moment will make you more self-aware. Meditation doesn&rsquo;t have to be a long, structured process, but rather just a few minutes to focus on your breathing and reflect. Tjan suggests thinking about these questions when focusing your thoughts:</p><li> What am I trying to achieve?</li><li> What am I doing that is working?</li><li> What am I doing that is slowing me down?</li><li> What can I do to change? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2) Identify your top priorities. </strong>  According to Tjan, &ldquo;one of the best ways to increase self-awareness is to write down what you want to do and track your progress.&rdquo; Consider documenting your goals, the traits you alreadyhave that will help you reach these goals, and the traits you still need in order to meet your goals. In doing this, you can better measure your success in both reaching your goals and measuring whether your self-awareness has increased or not.</p><p> <strong>  3) Take psychometric tests. </strong>  Though this may seem silly, these tests are beneficial in learning about your own leadership strengths and weaknesses. Being aware of your weaknesses will give you a starting point for becoming a more inclusive leader.</p><p> <strong>  4) Ask your peers. </strong>  The people who know you best are the greatest resources when you&rsquo;re trying to change your behavior and be more self-aware. If they have noticed you show the types of behavior you want to change, ask them questions about your personality. Though it might hurt to hear the truth, know that their feedback is crucial if you&rsquo;re trying to lead an inclusive workplace.</p><p> <strong>  5) Get feedback at work. </strong> This might be the most important step in becoming more self-aware. If you want to have an inclusive workplace, your employees need to know their feedback is valued and accepted. Tjan suggests bringing in an outside consulting firm to collect the feedback; this will protect the anonymity of your employees and remove any bias.</p><p> Lastly, self-aware leaders are an example for their employees. If they see you are trying to be more self-aware in order to be inclusive of others, they will likely follow suit.</p>",

    "title": "Are You Selling Value Or \"Stuff\"?",
    "link": "are-you-selling-value-or-stuff",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> We recently had a prospect meeting and the discussion was about shifting from a commodity sale to becoming more value oriented. It&rsquo;s a really important shift in today&rsquo;s business environment where the consumers/customers are more informed than ever and almost everything can be researched online.</p><h3> How to Shift from Commodity Sales to Value Selling</h3><p> <br/> Many of our clients face the challenge of being in a market where their product or service is considered a commodity. The challenge there is that it is usually a price driven discussion and sales people are trained to commoditize their sales approach rather than selling value.</p><h3> Focus on Value Rather than Features</h3><p> <br/> When a company offers a product that is viewed as a commodity, very often sales people feel they need to focus on the features of their service or product only to find out that their prices are undercut by the competition. Somebody, somewhere can always do something similar cheaper. But think about yourself:  Most people generally don&rsquo;t buy features. They buy what they feel gives them the most value for a specific solution. Let me give you a couple of examples.</p><h3> Is It the Way Coffee Tastes, or the Way You Feel When You Drink It?</h3><p> <br/> I would consider coffee a commodity. And of course it is when you buy coffee bean futures, but I am talking about buying a cup of coffee and enjoying it. Starbucks, before they broke into the American market figured out that Europeans enjoy their coffee experience. It wasn&rsquo;t only about the quality of the coffee (although also very important), but everything around it. The smell, when you walk into a Cafe, the way your waiter/barista remembers how you like it, the fact that you can sit and enjoy while you are sipping it.</p><p> All of a sudden, America went from percolators (so 1950&rsquo;s!) to signature drinks where it sometimes takes as long to order a coffee (tall, skinny, dry Hazelnut Cappuccino?!) than a meal in a restaurant. What happened? Starbucks changed the way Americans look at drinking coffee. It&rsquo;s no longer about a brown drink, it&rsquo;s about relaxing, gathering, enjoying- the VALUE of the entire experience.</p><p> This approach can be used for every sales process, even when the process has traditionally been viewed as a commodity sale. And your customers will change the way they think about your product/service.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s Not About the Features of Your Product, but the Value</h3><p> <br/> One of our clients sells very high-performance tooling equipment. Their products are more expensive than those offered by the competition but the quality of their tools is unmatched. We&rsquo;re helping their sales people focus on the peace of mind they are selling, the long-term savings in labor and replacement costs, as well as higher production rather than the product features. Their sales people now focus on the value rather than the product features. Quality products don&rsquo;t break as often, they are reliable and long lasting. When you buy and use them, you don&rsquo;t have to think about getting a new one for a really long time, sometimes for a lifetime.</p><p> If your sales people focus on that peace of mind, on long-term savings, talk about the quality and the reliability, then discussions on price will become secondary. Once you lead with features, your prospects will start comparing and then price is the top of mind discussion.</p><h3> Freight is Freight, or Is It?</h3><p> <br/> One could argue that freight is freight and market research is market research. Yes, of course it is, but once you launch this tactical approach, talking about the speed of your freight delivery or the accuracy of your market research results, what do you think will happen? People will start comparing your offering with that of the competition and they will start price shopping.</p><p> If your sales people however focus on the fact that your freight will be in good hands, that once you hand off a project, you don&rsquo;t have to think about it anymore and all the details will be taken care of, then you are selling peace of mind. The same holds true in the market research/agency world. People are not looking for numbers, as they assume that they are accurate. They are looking for ways to use those numbers to understand their customers better, or to grow their market share.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s About a Mindset Shift</h3><p> <br/> I, for example don&rsquo;t sell consultative sales training, I sell the way our participants feel about business development. Our graduates look at business development in a completely different way. They learn the skills and concepts to genuinely understand their customer&rsquo;s needs, gaining more confidence which in turn results in more profitable accounts. We provide our clients with a training program that keeps their employees accountable. They no longer feel that they are sales people trying to get business, but they know that they are consultants who help their prospects be more successful. They add value and when adding value sales professionals are more comfortable asking for business.</p><h3> Be Proud of Your Price Tag</h3><p> <br/> There is nothing wrong with being more expensive, as long as you have sales people who understand the real value that their customers and prospects are looking for and can communicate it. Own your price tag. As a matter of fact, when I sold services that were more expensive than the competition, I would proudly say. &ldquo;Yes, we are more expensive, and here is why&rdquo;.</p>",

    "title": "6 Reasons Why Performance Reviews Go Wrong",
    "link": "6-reasons-why-performance-reviews-go-wrong",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When it comes to the workplace, we hold certain truths to be self-evident. Morning traffic is the worst, Fridays are better than Mondays, and performance reviews are awful &ndash; at least when it comes to traditional ones. A good performance review should inspire employees to reach new heights at work while also celebrating their successes. So how is it that a study by psychologists at  <u>  <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/prs/12/4/189/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kansas State University, Eastern Kentucky University, and Texas A&amp;M  </a> </u>  finds that basically everyone loathes these reviews?</p><h3> Time-sensitive info:</h3><p> Two of the most common performance reviews are the annual and semiannual evaluations. However, due to the  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/01/09/ten-reasons-performance-reviews-are-done-terribly/\" target=\"_blank\">  \"  <u>   recency effect,  </u>  \" </a>  employees are often critiqued on their most recent work rather than their cumulative efforts. While that logic may suit students cramming for a college final, it makes for bad management, since employees aren't being accurately judged on their total contributions.</p><h3> Useless info:</h3><p> How do you analyze 6 to 12 months' worth of work and condense it into a 30-minute meeting? It&rsquo;s not easy. Since these reviews are often used to promote professional development, it&rsquo;s immensely important that constructive feedback is being delivered to workers so they can succeed and grow in their roles.</p><h3> Negative reign:</h3><p> Even if you think you have great feedback, delivering it might be easier said than done. According to the research by psychologists mentioned above, it's hard for people to take criticism, which is pretty much a no-brainer to anyone who's had to manage others. However, even for the employees invested in better understanding their role, criticism delivered in performance appraisals was found to be extremely discouraging.</p><h3> Gone and forgotten:</h3><p> Perhaps worse than the critical nature of a performance review is what often follows one: nothing. Failing to follow up causes stress for employees who felt they had a lot to work on. Yet by nature, annual reviews allow for time lags in evaluations instead of making them a year-round process.</p><h3> Disenfranchised culture:</h3><p> Annual reviews are meant to bring the best out of employees, but instead they feed into a vicious cycle of criticism, broken communication, and alienation that can deplete an organization of its spirit. Without a healthy working relationship between employer and employee, the company culture is at risk of deteriorating in the hands of a disenfranchised workforce.</p><h3> Good as gone:</h3><p> <a href=\"https://resources.globoforce.com/globoforce-blog/infographic-the-startling-truth-about-performance-reviews\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Goboforce </a>  found that employees who felt that their performance appraisals were inaccurate were twice as likely to seek new jobs. These reviews are often treated by managers as items to be checked off a to-do list. Considering that about $1.1 billion are lost every year because of employee turnover, this unconcern can prove to be extremely costly.</p><p> It's clear as day &mdash; annual reviews need to go the way of the dodo. Time lags, useless feedback, and inaccurate information are making performance reviews underperform. So turn to frequent check-ins so you can better connect with your employees and keep a clear line of communication open. That way, you can stay on top of performance week by week instead of year by year.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Google your name. Go ahead. I&rsquo;ll wait&hellip;Then pull up your website, your LinkedIn profile and any other social media platforms where you have a presence and think about the following:</p><li> What does your online presence say about you?</li><li> What will plan sponsors think about your qualifications and professionalism when they visit your website or your LinkedIn profile?</li><li> Will your online presence help or hurt your chances of winning new business?</li>In today&rsquo;s age of 24/7 connectivity, your prospects will most certainly look you up online at some point during the sales process.  While you may be able to walk the walk with your knowledge, experience and process, your website and social media profiles will tell a different story if you haven&rsquo;t taken the time to position yourself as a 401k specialist.I recently conducted the <u> <a href=\"https://401kbestpractices.com/about-old/products/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Positioned 4 Growth Workshop </a></u> and each attendee received a personalized <u> Online Positioning Report Card</u>.<img alt=\"Online Positioning Assessment sample\" src=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/online-assessment-sample.fw_.png\"/>After reviewing 20 advisors&rsquo; online profiles, what I found was that the average advisor has done about 30% of what&rsquo;s needed to create a professional image that builds authority, trust and credibility online. This means there is a lot of room for improvement and for those that take a few steps now to enhance your online presence, it provides an opportunity to stand out above the competition.(<u> Click here to get your personalized Online Positioning Assessment &amp; Action Plan so you can see how you stack up and make changes that can position you as a 401k specialist.</u>)<h3> Five online positioning tips</h3>Let me share with you a few simple things you can do that don&rsquo;t necessarily require a lot of time and effort to apply, but can greatly impact how you&rsquo;re perceived online.<strong> 1. Professionally brand your website and profiles</strong>The first thing people notice when they visit your website or your social media profiles is your branding. You want to have a professional, consistent brand across all platforms which includes:<li> Logo &ndash; You need a professional, easily recognizable logo.</li><li> Colors &ndash; Your website and images should have a consistent color scheme (background, header titles, etc.) that compliments your logo.</li><li> Your picture &ndash; You need a current, professional (but approachable) picture of you for your site and social media profiles.</li>Here&rsquo;s a great example of how <u> <a href=\"http://gregoryricks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Greg at Gregory Ricks &amp; Associates </a></u> displays consistent branding across all platforms:<a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/branding-example2.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Example of consistent branding Gregory Hicks website\" src=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/branding-example2.gif\"/></a><strong> 2. Ensure consistent messaging across all platforms</strong>The next thing people look at or look for on your website is to figure out who you are, what services you&rsquo;re offering, and what&rsquo;s in it for them.  This makes it critical that your message is clear, consistent across all platforms, and includes the following:<li> Target audience &ndash; Identify who is your ideal client and make sure this message comes across online.  You want to speak to your target audience and let them know they&rsquo;re in the right place.</li><li> Your value proposition &ndash; Include your value proposition or shorter value-statement (sometimes referred to as your brand slogan) that explains what benefit or outcome you help your clients achieve. This should be one of the first things people see on all of your online platforms.</li><li> Call to action &ndash; On every platform, make it clear what your visitor should do next.  You can change your website and your social media profiles into lead generating magnets by giving something away that solves a problem, addresses a challenge, or fills a need that you KNOW your ideal client has.  Put it behind a subscription form to collect contact info and tell them how to access your giveaway with a strong directive that stands out, such as &ldquo;Download the Report Now&rdquo;.</li>The online profiles of <u> <a href=\"http://momanddadmoney.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Matt from Mom and Dad Money </a></u> provide a great example of not only brand consistency, but a clear message and call to action (&ldquo;Get the Roadmap&rdquo;).  Notice how Matt&rsquo;s message &ldquo;Helping new parents build happy families by making money simple&rdquo; is on all platforms.<a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/branding-example.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Mom and Dad Money example of branding, call to action and clear message.\" src=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/branding-example.jpg\"/></a>Once you have the branding and messaging down, the next thing I&rsquo;d recommend is to identify ways you can add authority, trust, and credibility builders to your online profiles that position you as a 401k specialist.<strong> 3. Include authority builders</strong>To build authority as a 401k specialist, it helps to be seen as the expert and educator and the way you can do this online is by incorporating the following items:<li> Credentials &ndash; Completing advanced training and earning retirement designations makes you much more qualified than advisors that have not received any specialized training when competing for 401k business. Be sure to include your credentials in your online profiles and expand on the descriptions in your LinkedIn profile.</li><li> Recognition or Awards &ndash; If you&rsquo;ve received any awards or been nominated for industry specific recognition or roles, include this information on your profile as well.  Until you&rsquo;ve achieved this level of success, join retirement industry organizations like  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/brand-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NAPA  </a> </u>  or the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.psca.org/psca-membership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PSCA  </a> </u>  and add this information to your profile.</li><li> Education &ndash; Another way to be seen as a subject matter authority is to teach.  You can do this by offering workshops, webinars, videos or even through publishing articles, white papers and blog posts to your website and to your LinkedIn profile.</li><strong> 4. Include credibility builders</strong>Building credibility online is not much different than how you&rsquo;d build credibility in person. Consider the following:<li> Professional Appearance &ndash;Your online image says a lot about you and your level of professionalism.  If you have a cluttered, inconsistent and incomplete online presence, you&rsquo;ll come across the same way as if you&rsquo;ve shown up for a job interview in wrinkled pajamas.  Dress for the job you want, or so the saying goes.  Make sure your online profiles all have a consistent brand, professional image, photos that are of real people and places relevant to your practice (NOT stock images), a clean logo, is easy to navigate, is updated and current, etc.</li><li> Authentic &ndash; When you speak in an authentic voice, you come across as more believable than when you try to use complex words, industry jargon, or an overtly professional tone that you&rsquo;d never use when talking to your prospects face to face. Check the content on your website and LinkedIn summary.  Make sure that it&rsquo;s written to speak to your audience (not in the third person) using the word &ldquo;you&rdquo; twice as much as the word &ldquo;I&rdquo;.  Keep a conversational tone and let your personality shine through.</li><li> Include your &ldquo;Why&rdquo; &ndash;What is the reason you are in the business? Why do you feel the services you offer are important or why have you chosen to work with your niche client? When you share your &ldquo;why&rdquo; it gives people a chance to diffuse the typical apprehensions about being sold to and can create a bond or connection as you tell your story.</li><strong> 5. Include trust builders</strong>If you want to build trust with your prospects online, this is where you need to get down to specifics.<li> Case Studies &ndash; Share the results of the work you do by providing case studies or scenarios of how you&rsquo;ve helped your clients address specific challenges or improved their plan.</li><li> Client List or Logos &ndash; If your compliance department allows it, get written permission from your corporate clients to use their logos in a representative client list on your website, just as you would in your pitch book.</li><li> Specific Statistics and Examples &ndash; Cite specific regulations, case law, or studies to prove and reinforce the points you make in your online education articles.  Link to independent surveys, studies, or sources on your site that make a case for the value of the services you offer. For example, if you list investment policy statement support as a service you offer or discuss this topic in a webinar or on your blog, you might link to Fred Reish&rsquo;s white paper  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.drinkerbiddle.com/Templates/media/files/publications/2015/Managing-DC-Plan-IPS.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Managing Defined Contribution Plan Investment Policy Statements&rdquo;  </a> </u>  as a credible source to confirm and reiterate the importance of this item.</li>Here&rsquo;s a great example of how <u> Cafaro Greenleaf</u> includes case studies, awards, and a sample client list to build authority, credibility and trust.<a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TRUST-EXAMPLE.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Cafaro Greenleaf example of trust builders\" src=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TRUST-EXAMPLE.gif\"/></a><h3> Position yourself online as a credible 401k specialist</h3>There&rsquo;s no doubt that how you appear to prospects online can potentially win or lose you business.  It&rsquo;s not difficult to position yourself as a professional, credible 401k specialist by taking some time to create a professional brand, consistent message, and add authority, trust and credibility builders to your online profiles.",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Amy Klimek | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZipRecruiter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   ZipRecruiter  </u> </a></p><p> The average person will spend over 99,000 hours at work in the course of their lifetime. Knowing that a sizeable portion of your waking life will be spent on the job, it&rsquo;s important to find something that you enjoy. It&rsquo;s time to take control of your job and get the results that you want to lead a happy and productive life.</p><h3> Take stock of your past</h3><p> <br/> They say you can&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going if you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;ve been. Take some time to reflect on your  <a href=\"https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  career </a>  up until now, and evaluate your successes and your failures. Think about when you were happiest and most productive in your career, and when you felt uninspired and bored. If you can remember the circumstances around your career journey&rsquo;s ups and downs, you can use that knowledge to guide your decisions about your future.</p><h3> Envision your future</h3><p> <br/> Figure out what you want your future to look like. Do you want to dedicate yourself to one organization and steadily rise up the corporate ladder? Are you interested in seeking out new opportunities in a different field? Do you want to earn enough money to enable you to retire early and travel the world? Or do you want to raise a family and have time to spend with them, watching them grow? By understanding how you want your future to shape up, you can make smarter decisions about what type of job will set you up for success.</p><h3> Avoid negative self-talk</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes, you are your own worst enemy. Negative self-talk can keep you from engaging in exciting opportunities and new chances to grow. We all fall victim to self-doubt from time to time, and it can be hard to silence our inner critic. Don&rsquo;t limit your list of potential new jobs because you are nervous that you can&rsquo;t hack it. Instead, remind yourself of your skills and talents. Think back to another time when you successfully completed a project that made you a nervous wreck in the beginning. Also, don&rsquo;t get discouraged if your job search starts off slow. It can be easy to begin doubting your skills when the frustration of your job search sets in. Call up a supportive friend or former colleague who can adjust your attitude by reminding and reassuring you of your talent. Exude confidence by acknowledging your skills and abilities, and employers will recognize them as well.</p><h3> Work your contacts</h3><p> <br/> In today&rsquo;s career market, it&rsquo;s often more about who you know than what you know. Be sure that the key component of your job search is connecting with your network of friends and former colleagues. They are often the best resources to learn about new jobs and openings that fit your skill set. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to let your friends know that you are looking for a job; you&rsquo;d be surprised how helpful they can be in offering solid leads. You can also utilize social media wisely to expand your network through sites like Facebook and LinkedIn.</p><h3> Be open to new ideas</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t pigeonhole your job search into limited areas or interests. Be open to ideas that you hadn&rsquo;t thought of before. The unknown doesn&rsquo;t have to be scary; more often it&rsquo;s exciting and inspiring. Just because your career has followed a certain path in the past, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t shake things up for your future. Similarly, just because you&rsquo;ve always lived in a certain part of the country, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to stay there forever. Think about whether you&rsquo;d be willing to relocate for the right job. If you are open to a change of scenery, you open yourself up to a much wider job market than you ever expected.</p><p> Follow these tips for taking control of your job, and you can end up in a position where you truly thrive. Because if you&rsquo;re going to spend 99,000 hours at work, you might as well enjoy them.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p>Good leaders are those who set their people up to succeed. For you to be an effective leader, you have to keep away from management practices that destroy employee productivity. While there is no such thing as a &ldquo;perfect leader&rdquo;, you have to consistently try to be a good one. Below are some practices that you should avoid at all costs to make sure you are not the reason for your workers&rsquo; decreasing efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Using fear to motivate people.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although fear is an effective motivator at times, repeatedly threatening your employees&rsquo; job security will not give you the results you want. Employees who are too afraid to lose their job are likely to gossip with coworkers, or secretly look for another job in case they really lose their current one. These are activities that do nothing but decrease productivity and kill morale. Instead of fear-mongering, you should create a workplace culture built on respect, trust and engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Calling out employees in public.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Praising employees publicly is good, but criticizing them publicly is a big NO. Criticizing an employee in front of other workers isn&rsquo;t only embarrassing for the one being called out, but it also has a negative effect on the morale of the whole team. If you feel that there is a need to counsel a team member, do it privately and not in a way that may distract others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Not being emotionally vested in a project.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Good leaders lead their team members, and don&rsquo;t just give orders the latter should follow. If you are noticeably disengaged in a project, there is a huge possibility that your team will feel the same about it. As a leader, you have to be accountable and responsible for whatever happens to your project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Ignoring good performance from team members.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ineffective leaders are very good at ignoring the special abilities of their team and its members. If you continue failing to reward or praise great performances by your people, there is no way you can expect them to perform at a high level. You have to determine what each of your employees is capable of, and give them tasks and responsibilities that can leverage those skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Conducting ineffective meetings.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meetings play a very important role in managing a project. It is where <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/mentor-program-details/\" target=\"_blank\"> managers get updates </a> on the status of certain projects, and it is also where they give out instructions to the group or individually. However, meetings that are poorly managed are not likely to be productive, and can instead lead employees to eventually lose interest. Thus, managers have to make sure their employees get something of value and relevance out of their meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For a team, department or an organization to be productive, the manager has to find a way to inspire their people to be engaged. By avoiding the bad management practices mentioned above, you will be able to get closer to creating a highly productive environment.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As one of the greatest nations on the planet, the United States excels in a number of areas, innovation and entrepreneurship foremost among them. But something you might be hard-pressed to find at the top of anyone&rsquo;s best-of list is infrastructure&mdash;specifically roads, rail and mass transit.</p><p> In this department at least, the U.S. has some catching up to do with other parts of the globe. The World Economic Forum&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Global Competitiveness Report 2014-2015  </a> </u>  ranks the U.S. 16th in &ldquo;quality of overall infrastructure&rdquo;&mdash;15th in quality of its rail system and 16th in quality of its roads.</p><p> Heavy news indeed for the country known for building the first-of-its-kind transcontinental railway and interstate highway system.</p><p> But if you&rsquo;ve been keeping up with current events, this shouldn&rsquo;t come as a shock. The recent and very tragic Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia is a somber reminder that America needs stronger infrastructure policies at every level of government. This will not only help save lives but also create jobs, boost the economy and make transportation more safe and efficient.</p><p> Civil engineers have been making this case for years. Following its most recent assessment of all forms of infrastructure, from energy to schools to drinking water, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)  </a> </u>  gave the U.S. a depressingly low overall grade of D+. Levees and inland waterways were the worst offenders, both slapped with a D-. According to the group, which releases its report every four years, a staggering $3.6 trillion will be necessary by 2020 to bring the nation&rsquo;s infrastructure up to ideal conditions. Short of this investment, the ASCE says, $1 trillion in U.S. business sales could be lost every year, along with millions of jobs.</p><p> The mayors of some of the largest U.S. cities emphatically acknowledge the relationship between quality infrastructure and strong economic growth. In a recent poll taken of several mayors, Politico magazine found that infrastructure sits atop their list of concerns. Thirty-five percent cited &ldquo;better infrastructure&rdquo; as the one thing that could help their city&rsquo;s economy grow the most; 31 percent said that &ldquo;deteriorating infrastructure&rdquo; was the city&rsquo;s greatest challenge.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/FT-US-Mayors-Emphasize-the-Importance-of-Infrastructure-amd-Education_05202015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Mayor Emphasize the Importance of Infrastructure and Education\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/FT-US-Mayors-Emphasize-the-Importance-of-Infrastructure-amd-Education_05202015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> But public spending on infrastructure, at every level, has declined pretty rapidly as a percentage of GDP since the recession, falling well below its lowest point in the last 20 years.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/Total-Public-Construction-Spending-in-the-US-as-a-Percentage-of-GDP-05-2015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"total Public Construction Spending in the U.S. as a Percentage of GDP\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/Total-Public-Construction-Spending-in-the-US-as-a-Percentage-of-GDP-05-2015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> And now, some emerging regions, most notably China, are chugging ahead with large-scale construction projects, both domestic and international, that promise to kick-start business, strengthen trade routes and safely connect people from all corners or their borders.</p><h3> One Road, One Belt&hellip; Big Opportunity</h3><p> <br/> Whereas the U.S. spends less than 2 percent of its GDP on infrastructure, China currently spends around 9 percent on both domestic and foreign projects. Back in December, I pointed out that China has the most extensive network of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11208\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   high-speed rail  </a> </u>  in the world&mdash;approximately 7,000 miles&rsquo; worth, all told&mdash;with thousands more miles of track under construction. This will require untold amounts of natural resources.</p><p> And with China&rsquo;s grand &ldquo;One Road, One Belt&rdquo; initiative underway, even more resources will be needed. The strategy, which harkens back to the famed Silk Road, is intended to open up new trade routes to Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.</p><p> The flagship project of One Road, One Belt is the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, an elaborate series of roads, rail and pipeline that will cut lengthwise through Pakistan, giving China convenient access to ports on the Arabian Sea. Along the way, several energy projects are slated to be built.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/The-Proposed-46-billion-China-Pakistan-Economic-Corridor-05-2015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"the Proposed $46-Billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/The-Proposed-46-billion-China-Pakistan-Economic-Corridor-05-2015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> If everything goes according to plan, the entire 2,000-mile corridor, expected to take 15 years to complete, should come in at around $46 billion, making it one of the most expensive infrastructure projects in human history.</p><p> It&rsquo;s certainly the most China will have ever spent in another country. If you recall, it&rsquo;s now investing more money outside its borders than it is domestically,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11209\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   having exceeded $100 billion  </a> </u>  for the first time in 2014. The country is investing so heavily in Africa, in fact, that some economists have nicknamed it  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11209\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;China&rsquo;s Second Continent.&rdquo;  </a> </u></p><p> One of the ways our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11210\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   China Region Fund (USCOX)  </a> </u>  is participating in the massive One Road, One Belt endeavor is through China Railway Construction, a top-10 holding.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Nothing creates chaos faster than having bills left over at the end of your paycheck. It&rsquo;s a sure formula for sleepless nights, late notices and harassing phone calls from obnoxious bill collectors.</p><p> You can manage the chaos with a simple budget that allows for your rent/mortgage, utilities, food, clothing, phone and other regular expenses AND to put a dent in your debt (or curb runaway spending). You can use systems like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.youneedabudget.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   YNAB.com  </a> </u>  (You Need A Budget),  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mvelopes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mvelopes.com  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mint.com  </a> </u> , or  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.firststepcashmanagement.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FirstStepCashManagement.com  </a> </u>  to name a few. You&rsquo;ll need to gather your information and set up your budget&mdash;then it&rsquo;s all about tracking.</p><p> Think of it like losing weight, training for a marathon or saving for a big important goal. Monitoring is a huge part of success and is actually quite satisfying to most people.</p><p> Or, you can just kill your cash flow in six easy steps </p><li> <strong>  Ignore your credit card spending </strong> &mdash;as long as the plastic is handy, it can be very easy to lose track of how much you&rsquo;re actually spending. When the monthly bill comes in, you might find that you&rsquo;ve put yourself into a hole that is no fun crawling out of.</li><li> <strong>  Forget that you&rsquo;re responsible for some of your health care expenses. </strong> Every health plan on the planet comes complete with deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-network limits on coverage that you just might have forgotten when setting up your budget. That unexpected medical bill just might be enough to throw your plan into complete collapse.</li><li> <strong>  Fail to set up an ample emergency fund. </strong> Yes, you KNOW how important an emergency fund is. You KNOW that it&rsquo;s a source for unexpected expenses. But do you resist this step because you&rsquo;d rather put the money &ldquo;to work&rdquo; in a long-term investment plan than earning next to nothing in a savings account? Sure that makes sense if the markets work in your favor and you don&rsquo;t need to tap into your investments when the markets are down. But it&rsquo;s more likely a double whammy that punctures your financial spare.</li><li> <strong>  Neglect to consider whether you&rsquo;ll owe the government at tax time. </strong> What&mdash;you received a refund last year? Great! But that doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you won&rsquo;t owe Uncle next April 15. Lots of things can happen to jack your liability into the red. A raise, a bonus, capital gains, loss of deductions, changes in tax law and even unemployment benefits can shift your bracket and leave you with a bill that will not wait to be satisfied by a forgiving Uncle.</li><li> <strong>  Engage in retail therapy. </strong> Feeling stressed? Need a change, shift, new look, or just a feeling that you &ldquo;can&rdquo; afford to go out on a shopping spree? These unexpected and unwelcome expenses can leave your wallet and your stomach feeling queasy.</li><li> <strong>  Allow guilt to guide your spending. </strong> Your neighbors just bought this great new wooden swing set for their kids when they came back from a Disney Cruise. You can almost hear your kids thinking &ldquo;LOSER&rdquo; as their little downcast eyes sear your soul. How can you be such a terrible parent? Of COURSE you&rsquo;ll get that swing set, go on a vacation and have a really great tree house built to make your neighbors cringe. Yeah, you&rsquo;ll show them! <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s not difficult to create a savvy spending and savings plan, but it&rsquo;s easier to destroy your happiness by falling into those six easy traps. Resist the cash flow killers.</p><p> Choosing to take the more challenging, but satisfying, road of living within your means, saving prudently and building financial security means you&rsquo;re just going to have to do the work. But it means you get to live your values and create your version of happy. How sweet is that?</p>",

    "content": "<strong> Complexity is in the eye of the beholder.</strong>To me, astrophysics is a complex discipline; to Stephen Hawking it is not.<strong> People engaged in complex situations fall into two categories: those who accept complexity as a fact of life and work with it, and those who fight it every inch of the way.</strong>I&rsquo;m in that later camp.In today&rsquo;s business, complexity is prolific. There are hundreds of reasons why ambiguity and complication have reared their ugly heads to complicate your professional life&mdash;some of the reasons are externally-driven, but most are self-created&mdash;maybe not by you, but by people above and/or before you. If left unchecked, complexity can stifle, stagnate, and eventually bring an organization to its knees.So what are you going to do about it? The &lsquo;way&rsquo; to cut through the clutter is to simplify. I know; this is easier said than done. How do you simplify when the demands of customers, colleagues, and shareholders continue to escalate?I&rsquo;m suggesting that you &lsquo;do less, better.&rsquo; This strategy requires sacrifice. Again, easier said than done. Dumping pet projects, reducing your customer list, or turning down new sales opportunities can be incredibly difficult to do. It can feel impossible to &lsquo;think smaller&rsquo; when everyone around you is firmly entrenched in the &lsquo;do more&rsquo; strategic paradigm.To enact the &lsquo;do less better&rsquo; strategy, you have to buy into the notion that 20% of your effort delivers 80% of the rewards. You focus on that 20% to generate a high ROE (return on effort).<strong> Doing less, better can work throughout an organization.</strong>It starts with the corporate strategy, and includes marketing strategy, and the all-important human resource strategy.Unlike <u> <a href=\"https://www.pepsico.com/brands/product-information\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  PepsiCo </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.coca-colacompany.com/brands/the-coca-cola-company\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Coca-Cola&rsquo;s </a></u> corporate strategy is to resist diversification and focus on non-alcoholic beverages. That singularity continues to deliver outstanding shareholder value. In marketing, great branding steers clear of multi-benefits; one clear, compelling benefit will find a place in busy minds. For effective workplace culture, <u> <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/laura-entis/5-strategies-to-steal-from-google.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Google </a></u> promotes and supports openness in which everyone is encouraged to share ideas and opinions. In a nutshell, that&rsquo;s the focus of Google&rsquo;s HR strategy.<strong> Doing less, better doesn&rsquo;t mean doing less work.</strong>Those who are devoted to focus, work harder because they are passionate and emotionally-connected to the vision.Bulldozing the walls of complexity in companies and departments never comes without sacrifice. The earlier and the bigger the sacrifice, the easier it gets afterward. Sacrifice must remain a part of the organization&rsquo;s DNA to sustain competitive advantage.",

    "link": "what-to-do-when-a-prospect-isnt-ready-to-be-a-client",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Lots of businesses focus on their sales process. Fewer talk about their clients&rsquo; buying process.</p><p> Which is the more important of the two?</p><p> Kevin Davis&rsquo;s 2011 book  Slow Down, Sell Faster!  put forward the powerful idea that whilst many people focus on sales techniques, it&rsquo;s the clients buying process that really matters. That&rsquo;s what should define how you as advisers engage potential new clients. That makes sense, right?</p><p> Another expert blog I read made the following point about webinars. &ldquo;The issue is often that the presenter and participant have different objectives. The presenter wants a new client. The participant wants free information.&rdquo; Again, this is a concept that could as easily refer to prospects engaging advice professionals.</p><p> More recently I heard the view expressed that the upcoming challenge facing many advice firms will be that clients who are currently under the age of about 35-ish will do anything to avoid paying for advice.</p><p> Yep, they would choose to ask friends and family for guidance, follow the lead of Doctor Google or rely on free information from unattributed sources rather than invest in getting the opinion of an expert.</p><p> This is a problem. It&rsquo;s a problem not just for advice firms, but also because of the potential future ramifications that follow for clients following that type of advice.</p><p> However, this is also about the shift in clients&rsquo; buying process.</p><p> Slow Down, Sell Faster!  puts forward the idea that most clients&rsquo; buying process works a bit like this.</p><p> <strong>  Step 1: Need. </strong> This is the point I encounter a problem, or suddenly realise there is something I want to do in my life that I didn&rsquo;t yesterday. I reach a point where inaction is no longer appealing and I&rsquo;m driven to do something.</p><p> <strong>  Step 2: Research. </strong>  I start to look at my options, accruing as much information as I can to lead me along the path to diagnosing a solution. Keep this stage in mind, because this is where the trouble starts.</p><p> <strong>  Step 3: Buy. </strong>  Now I decide on a solution (or select range of solutions that I can reasonably choose between). The battle between Buyer Acceptance and Buyer Reluctance rages. I must reach a point with my inner decision-making mechanism where the perceived benefits far outweighs the perceived risk. I &ldquo;tip&rdquo; into making a choice.</p><p> <strong>  Step 4: Value. </strong>  Now I&rsquo;ve made the decision, I&rsquo;m jumping into that interesting period where I will find out whether I&rsquo;ve made the right one. Buyers remorse lurks in the wings, but I&rsquo;m also just as likely to convince myself of the value if the experience post-Buy is good. This is where firms that have raving fans prove their difference.</p><p> As you can imagine, that process doesn&rsquo;t always line up with the engagement process of many advice firms. In fact, I&rsquo;d suggest that whilst many firms&rsquo; process hasn&rsquo;t changed, the buying process absolutely has.</p><p> Research and Buy almost used to be the same stage not that long ago. I&rsquo;d get a referral from a trusted friend or colleague to someone who had authority/ expertise/ experience in solving a Need.</p><p> I&rsquo;d sit opposite that person, probing them with questions to assess their true knowledge, getting a sense of whether I knew, liked and trusted them. With few other sources of info available to me, I may well make the call that seeing as they seemed the real deal, I&rsquo;d go ahead and Buy.</p><p> Then came the Internet and Social Media.</p><p> Now the Research piece is far more pronounced. For many firms, by the time a client is sat in your office, they may well have poured through pages and pages of information (and misinformation), self-diagnosing their problems in much the same way a patient presents at a hospital insistent they have cancer, rather than trapped wind.</p><p> Even worse, they may be coming to see you whilst they&rsquo;re still in the Research phase, so instead of actually coming to take your advice they&rsquo;re there to remove the uncertainty from their own research.</p><p> Or they may even be overwhelmed altogether, never getting out of Research and, by default, get trapped in the Procrastination Zone.</p><p> So, what can you actually do about it?</p><li> <strong>  Be clear about who your target clientele is and stick to it. </strong>  If you&rsquo;re targeting clients with simple financial issues that can probably be solved with DIY or even automated advice, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to evolve your business model anyway.</li><li> <strong>  Be vigilant about pre-vetting. </strong>  Many advisers worry that pre-vetting clients is &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;, or will offend. It&rsquo;s not about that. Pre-vetting is about making sure nobody&rsquo;s time is wasted. Having a quick conversation ahead of a meeting is important in making sure that both parties don&rsquo;t have conflicting intentions (as per the webinar example). It&rsquo;s about recognising that sometimes setting up a meeting with you might not be the next logical step.</li><li> <strong>  Provide avenues prospects can do down to gather information without having to meet with you. </strong> This is where automation can really work for advice firms. Information Centres, such as the outsourced solution provided by firms like  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/client-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Innergi  </a> </u> , or self-managed Members plugins for your WordPress site like  <u>  <a href=\"http://member.wishlistproducts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wishlist  </a> </u> , are ways of creating a trusted source of good content. Webinars and seminars are also a good way of scaling in this way. It&rsquo;s a route we&rsquo;ve also explored at Audere with this blog, our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.feemodeler.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fee Modeler  </a> </u>  tool and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shipanalysis.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SHIP Analysis Business Diagnostic  </a> </u> . The idea here is to add value in the Research stage without forcing someone to commit face time when they&rsquo;re not ready to buy.</li><li> <strong>  Stay out of solution mode. </strong>  If you do end up meeting with someone who is still in the Research phase, avoid simply providing yet more information. Approach the meeting with the intent of helping the client work through their thinking. Make the client realise the gaps in their own knowledge, and potentially how costly it might be to try and replicate your experience with the aid of nothing more than opinion blogs and generic case studies. This approach will create far more value anyway, and give you a much better chance of flipping them into Buy mode. <br/>  </li><p> That&rsquo;s just four examples of a number of techniques that can be applied to reach the ideal nirvana that when a prospect sits in your office, they&rsquo;re ready to Buy.</p><p> Efficiency is high on the agenda of so many firms right now. Add in the challenges of being an expert in an information-rich world, it&rsquo;s understandable the focus falls on process efficiency as the only way to get more productive time from the day.</p><p> Providing the support clients need at their own buying stage, rather than driving them through your sales process, can be just as effective. It&rsquo;s one of a number of ways to help make sure that when you are face-to-face, you&rsquo;re both getting exactly what you want from the experience.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Mark Gillen | <u>  econnexx </u></p><h3> Prospecting Creates More Personal Relationships</h3><p> <br/> Having personal interactions with prospects is still the most effective way to build relationships, create trust and generate clients for financial advisers. Online networks such as Linkedin provide financial advisers the ability to build personal relationships with a vast number of people. These relationships can be developed and nurtured, providing huge returns and increased client numbers.</p><p> Personal one on one engagement with multiple people on a daily basis takes time, time that many simply cannot afford to spare.</p><p> But there is a solution, a solution that can enable a financial adviser to personally engage with 2000 potential clients per month, with little or no effort.</p><h3> Online Prospecting</h3><p> <br/> At econnexx we have created a process that enables us to deliver targeted and personalised messages to 2000 plus prospects per month. Each prospect fits within a designated geographical area and meets a pre set criteria, such as the industry they work within and their position within the company.</p><h3> How It Works</h3><p> <br/> Through research we have established there are typically 5 types of responses from prospects who receive a prospecting message. They are: </p><li> The prospect is ready to engage immediately and either makes direct contact or requests to be called.</li><li> The prospect sees value in your service but is not quite ready to act.</li><li> The prospect has no time</li><li> The prospect has no need (i.e they already have sought advice in the past or they self manage their finances.)</li><li> The prospect advises they have no money. <br/>  </li><p> Based on these responses we have created a process to pass the prospects direct to the adviser or deliver further messages to address their reply and further their desire to make contact. Some will make direct contact or request a call, some will have interest but have obstacles and questions they need to overcome before they are ready to make contact, while a proportion will either not respond or have no money to utilise your service.</p><p> These processes enable financial advisers to reach 2000 prospects per month with no effort required on their part. They only enter the process to engage with prospects who are ready to discuss their financial planning needs.</p><h3> Convert More Prospects To Clients With Automated Marketing</h3><p> <br/> Automated marketing enables you to convert more visitors to your site into contacts - providing you with the ability to remain in contact. Automated Marketing provides visitors with an offer that they can download, such as: 5 steps to achieving your financial goals. To benefit from the offer visitors complete a short form, providing you with the details needed to remain in contact. Each contact then enters an automated workflow process were they receive a series or automated, yet personal emails each designed to answer qualifying questions, remove obstacles and promote contact.</p><p> This process enables you to nurture site visitors and prospects who need more time and more information to make contact, converting a larger proportion into clients.</p><h3> Prospecting &amp; Automated Marketing Summarised</h3><p> <br/> 1. Prospecting reaches 2000 people per month. A proportion will make direct contact based on the message they receive, some require further information and nurturing before they are ready to make contact, some will choose not respond.</p><p> 2. Automated marketing enables you to cater to those who require further information or who believe they are already taking the required steps to ensure their financial plans are on track. Automated marketing allows you to remain in contact with those who visit your site and deliver communications that showcase your service and highlight their need to get in touch, converting more prospects and visitors into clients.</p><h3> Why These Processes Are So Effective</h3><p> <br/> Although it is essential for financial advisers to have an online presence to showcase their brand and generate contacts, many digital advertising and marketing channels require large resources and lack the ability to provide a personal experience for potential clients, in turn creating a degree of disconnect between firms and prospects.</p><p> The financial services sector provides tailored, personal solutions therefore your marketing and communications strategy must also be personal. Our technology and processes allow us to engage with prospects on behalf of clients and initiate conversation on a one on one basis. That is exactly what our prospecting service offers. Automated marketing provides the missing link between firms and the prospects who need more time and have more qualifying questions that need answered before they are ready to convert from a prospect to a client.</p>",

    "content": "<p> We had a chance to sit down with Lisette Smith and Tanya Rapacz, of The Partnership Resource to discuss the growing demand of their serivces within Financial Services, as well as in other industries. Enjoy!</p><p> <strong>  How did your careers start? </strong></p><p> We starting working together at a wealth management firm in 1999, then formed our own financial planning firm the following year.</p><p> <strong>  What led you two to get together and form The Partnership Resource? </strong></p><p> After we sold our wealth management firm, Lisette started advanced education in conflict resolution. Tanya soon followed. We were looking into the unique relationship that exists between business partners and there was so little research. Based on our own experience as partners, we knew there would be others looking for a way to manage conflict and avoid business disruptions. We enjoyed working and building something together. We embarked on our own research project and started a practice offering services and resources specifically for business partners.</p><p> <strong>  What exactly do you do? </strong></p><p> We work with partners from formation to succession. We provide a &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; guide to get the most out of their specific partnership, so they can have a thriving business and a great relationship. We take business partners through a process; generally this involves assessing where they are, conducting facilitated meetings, and capturing what they have agreed to.</p><p> <strong>  When businesses first discover your services, do they get it? </strong></p><p> People who have been in business partnerships where there has been conflict definitely understand the need for outside help and are relieved to know it exists. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d known about you before&rdquo; is something we often hear.</p><p> We also do a lot of work with partners who are merging and with so much on the line and high failure rates, people are starting to take notice earlier.</p><p> <strong>  Are you psychologists for business partners? </strong></p><p> That&rsquo;s an interesting way to look at it. While we&rsquo;re not licensed psychologists, there&rsquo;s certainly a lot of psychology theory in conflict resolution. Business partnerships can be very complex relationships. We think we bring the best of psychology theory and business perspective to the work we do. Our skills and services are generally more business-oriented and our process is very forward-looking for partners, focusing on what they each bring to the business.</p><p> <strong>  What kinds of problems do you see arising in your clients? </strong></p><p> Often they are at an inflection point in their business. This can be after the initial honeymoon of a startup, or after some level of success, facing issues related to the next phase of the business, or succession issues. There are a variety of possible conflicts, but many center on misunderstandings concerning relative contribution or the direction of the business.  A lot has to do with better defining roles, expectations and work styles.</p><p> <strong>  Besides problems, what other business events are helpful to think about in terms of a partnership? </strong></p><p> We&rsquo;ve been working more frequently with partners just embarking on a newly merged business. In some cases, the principals have previously been through a failed partnership, so they have a heightened awareness of the impacts.</p><p> <strong>  What warning signs do partnerships need to pay attention to that there&rsquo;s trouble brewing? </strong></p><p> There are three that seem to come up fairly frequently: 1) ineffective communication, including issues that never seem to be resolved; 2) change in tone of discourse; 3) avoiding contact, leading to an inability to make decisions.</p><p> <strong>  Is there a best in class framework to think about in terms of beginning a partnership? </strong></p><p> Definitely. We strongly recommend a Partnership Constitution, which is a document setting forth how you will work together to reach your vision of your business. We&rsquo;ve also developed some best practices, which can be downloaded <a href=\"http://www.thepartnershipresource.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> .</p><p> <strong>  Have you noticed any trends in conflicts within advisory partnerships? </strong></p><p> Many firms are considering mergers as a solution to succession planning.  This brings up a host of issues that have to be resolved regarding ownership, decision-making and roles in the merged firm.</p><p> <strong>  When a firm is considering their succession plan, what challenges can you help them to overcome? </strong></p><p> Succession planning is often driven, for obvious reasons, by a founder. As a result, it can be very difficult to have open and productive conversations, which can be very frustrating.  Having facilitated discussions is often the only way to make a break-through in some cases. </p><p> <strong>  How do you suggest firms think about adding new partners into the mix as others leave? </strong></p><p> When adding new partners, assessment tools, including psychometric testing, can give very valuable information; the partners should also be clear about what they hope to gain from each new partner being added.</p><p> <strong>  What do you enjoy most about your job? </strong></p><p> There is sometimes initial skepticism about whether working with us will really make a difference, especially if conflict among partners has gone on for some time and feels entrenched. The transformation is really rewarding; although partnerships may share similar issues, every partnership is unique.</p><p> <strong>  What is most difficult? </strong></p><p> We&rsquo;re still getting the word out that there&rsquo;s hope if your partnership has a problem that the partners have not been able to resolve. Partnership mediation is viable and accessible. The advantages are that it&rsquo;s confidential, cost-effective, and can resolve issues while keeping relationships intact.</p><p> <strong>  What would you like to leave us with? </strong></p><p> The benefits of building a successful business with a partner are incredibly valuable and worth protecting.  Conflicts don&rsquo;t have to get in the way of your business success.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whatsyourprice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sean Hoade  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Whats Your Price?  </u> </a></p><p> Dating has become more sophisticated, if not downright tricky, over the past few decades. It used to be that dinner and a movie or maybe the proverbial long walk on the beach would suffice for a couple just getting to know each other. There are pitfalls, however, as social mores and gender roles have grown more elastic. Here are a few conundra you&rsquo;ll be hard-pressed to avoid, along with our WhatsYourPrice opinion on the matter.</p><p> What we call &ldquo;chivalry&rdquo; in the 21st century is a far cry from the &ldquo;loving but never touching&rdquo; rules of the Middle Ages, of course. Now there are niceties such as opening doors for one&rsquo;s date, or pulling out her chair for her in restaurants, or even who pays up when the waiter brings the check.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_193313522.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"shutterstock_193313522\" src=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_193313522-300x200.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Still popular, however, is the old &ldquo;make sure she&rsquo;s not a witch made of wood&rdquo; routine.</p><h3> Opening Doors</h3><p> <br/> This is a classic paradox facing all men and women on dates. On the one hand, opening restaurant or car doors and pulling out chairs shows respect and consideration on the part of the gentleman, and graciously accepting such tokens of chivalry shows class and thoughtfulness on the part of the lady.</p><p> On the other hand, however, opening doors and making other moves to show what a chivalrous bit of maleness you are can backfire. Women&mdash;and not just those some call &ldquo;radical feminists&rdquo;&mdash;may feel that they are being treated condescendingly, like they are unable or unwilling to do for themselves. Women may resent the implied  quid pro quo  this creates: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done all these nice things for you; how about you doing something nice for me?&rdquo; It may not even be conscious for either person, but nonetheless it may hang over the date like a pall.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_205755949.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"shutterstock_205755949\" src=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_205755949-300x198.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> &ldquo;Wait, I can&rsquo;t come into the ladies&rsquo; room with you? Have you forgotten <br/> how I  unlocked your car door? &rdquo;</p><p> So what to do? Act chivalrous (for men) or accept such chivalry (for women), and risk falling into stereotyped gender roles right off the bat? Or acknowledge that women can open doors, go get drinks for themselves, and put their own coats on without manly assistance and risk looking like a thoughtless jerk and adding no value to the date?</p><p> Our take: Men lose nothing by starting out a date with opening doors, pulling out chairs, and otherwise acting in a &ldquo;gentlemanly&rdquo; manner. If a woman doesn&rsquo;t care for it, she will let you know.</p><h3> Paying the Check</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://whatsyourprice.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   WhatsYourPrice.com  </u> </a>  members pay for the privilege of a first date by making it worth the woman&rsquo;s while, since new outfits, shoes, makeup, etc. are expenses ladies have for new dates that men just don&rsquo;t have. So on a date, the playing field is even, with neither party owing anything to the other outside of a pleasant evening.</p><p> First dates that happen not to be arranged through WhatsYourPrice are nonetheless in the same situation once they reach the restaurant (for example). Couples on a modern first date have no history yet, no one owing the other.</p><p> With this in mind, what happens when the dinner check comes? Serving staff at restaurants used to always give the check to the man, assuming he would be paying for the meal. (In fact, some very high-end restaurants such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fourseasons.com/paris/dining/restaurants/le_cinq/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Le Cinq in Paris  </a> </u> , still give menus with prices on it only to the male, while the woman gets only the description of the food.) These days, the check is usually placed very deliberately in the middle, with the knowledge that either party may foot the bill.</p><p> So should a man grab it and insist on paying because he&rsquo;s the one who asked for the date? That might seem awfully presumptuous. But he can&rsquo;t really ask the woman if she wants to split it or give it to her to pay without that being agreed upon or at least discussed in some manner. This is thanks to many, many years of tradition: the man is, frankly, expected to pay the check is another arrangement has not been worked out in advance.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_211124530.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"shutterstock_211124530\" src=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_211124530-300x177.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> &ldquo;This is her card. I&rsquo;m very controlling.&rdquo;</p><p> Pay the check or ask for a split or even for the woman to pay? Much like the opening of doors and the pulling out of seats discussed above, what may seem chivalrous to one party may seem rude or unromantic to the other.</p><p> Our take: Gents should play it a little ironically. When the check comes, whether it is put directly in front of you or placed in the neutral zone, pick it up and say to your date with a smile, &ldquo;Okay if I get this one?&rdquo; It solves both problems, since the man has acted thoughtfully in several ways at once and, since he put it forth as a question, his date can tell him if she&rsquo;d rather they split the check or even pay the whole bill herself. Win-win.</p><h3> To Movie or Not to Movie?</h3><p> <br/> As mentioned above, dinner and a movie is a classic and fun date. But paradoxes abound in taking one&rsquo;s date to the Bijou. First is that while it&rsquo;s an intimate setting&mdash;arms touching, sharing a bag of popcorn, you&rsquo;re sitting together in the dark, you can sit in the back row, and so on. But you&rsquo;re supposed to be watching a movie. You could go make out on her couch at home and save $25 if you&rsquo;re not going to watch the flick!</p><p> Of course there is the venerable drive-in movie fooling around, but even then if it&rsquo;s a first date, do you want to make those car windows steamy on a first date? We advise against it at WhatsYourPrice.com, since it&rsquo;s throwing away all that anticipation and replacing it with satisfaction too early, which can make a relationship seem boring just when it could be building.</p><p> In any case, some pitfalls with going to a movie on a first date can be:</p><p> &bull;  You&rsquo;re together to get to know each other, yet you can&rsquo;t talk in a movie</p><p> &bull;  The movie could have extreme sex or violence in it or portray controversial political or social viewpoints that would be uncomfortable to watch with a date</p><p> &bull;  You might find out your movie tastes are utterly incompatible. This might not matter in an established relationship, but when your time together so far has been half taken up with a movie, if you didn&rsquo;t both like it or both hate it, that might be seen as a sign to bail before the best part of the date, the walk or drive home where fun stuff&mdash;not to mention discussion about a second date&mdash;happens.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_216384451.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"shutterstock_216384451\" src=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_216384451-300x200.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s like you can reach out and  touch  the awkwardness!</p><p> <strong>  Our take: </strong>  Unless you both are excited about a  particular  movie or show (think midnight premieres of hotly anticipated sequels), skip the theater altogether and spend that two hours getting to know one another better.</p><h3> Competitive anything</h3><p> <br/> You know what sounds like a fun and casual first date? Playing some mini-golf, maybe bowling a couple of games, or even shooting a few hoops. But beware, ye who would enter the world of competitive sports or games on a first date. Here there be tygers.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_214909390.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"shutterstock_214909390\" src=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_214909390-300x200.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Also beware, ye who would take a first date to the jungle for some reason.</p><p> Why? Any kind of competitive activity which involves two people who should just be having a good time places their date smack into the middle of a paradox: If the man wins, he also loses, because the other party may feel (even if it&rsquo;s silly) a little sad by losing. A chivalrous man, if he happens to be better at some one-on-one competition, is inclined to &ldquo;let her win&rdquo; so the activity stops being about who wins (in his mind, at least) and is more about the fun of the activity itself.</p><p> At least, that&rsquo;s the intention.</p><p> Sadly, however, a man who loses at a game or sport loses twice. The gent who lets his date win at, say, air hockey may not seem chivalrous at all, but instead look weak and pitiful. (The woman may not have this perception at all, but the man may think she does, and then it twists off into a tornado of self-doubt and self-recrimination.) If the woman knows she&rsquo;s lousy at it, she may pick up on him letting her win, and that would be uncomfortable at best and disastrous at worst.</p><p> <strong>  Our take: </strong>  Don&rsquo;t do it. Seriously, just don&rsquo;t.</p><h3> Chivalry can be fun</h3><p> <br/> Humans are full of paradoxes, believing one thing and doing the opposite, wanting and then not wanting and then wanting again some toy or experience or feeling. In dating, it&rsquo;s no different. To skirt possible painfully complex issues, treat each opportunity for chivalry as a little bit of fun, and she&rsquo;ll see that you just want to do what makes her feel good, giving  her  the occasional opportunity to take her turn opening the door for  you . Hang loose and have fun&mdash;that always makes for a great, non-paradoxical first date.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_211632100.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"shutterstock_211632100\" src=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_211632100-300x200.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Also wine and pizza. Hard to go wrong with that.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> There is a difference between being aggressive and being assertive.</h3><p> <br/> In the workplace, employees and managers working to advance themselves in their careers need to be clear on the distinction.</p><p> Aggressiveness is to be confrontational, possibly belligerent, hostile or violent behavior or attitudes toward another person. When someone is aggressive, he or she is ready to attack. People who slip into an aggressive mode make the interaction a win/lose issue regardless of relevance.</p><p> <strong>  Simply, aggressiveness can be about lack of respect for the other person(s) and can show-up in the environment as: </strong></p><li> Yelling</li><li> Cursing</li><li> Throwing things</li><li> Lack of listening to others <br/>  </li><p> Clearly, aggressiveness is not characteristic of good leadership behavior. It is often hurtful and damaging to relationships. In the workplace, one wants to build and cultivate good relationships, not destroy them.</p><p> On the other hand, an assertive person showcases emotional intelligence because he or she is in control of emotions and grounded in self-confidence.</p><p> Being assertive means being clear about what is meant and being clear about the outcome.

    "content": "<h3> Social Media Has VAST Untapped New Business Potential For B2Bs</h3><p> <br/> Are you trying to generate more sales leads but still can't quite grasp the value of social media for B2B marketing? If so, you could be one of the leading B2B brands missing out on a total of more than 70,000 sales opportunities which are up for grabs on social media every couple of months. No that's not a typo: that's 70,000!</p><p> The latest B2B Social Media Report by Brandwatch - which surveyed 200 B2B companies in the UK and the US - found that customers with an 'intent to purchase' on social media were simply not being engaged with by marketers. (An 'intent to purchase' is defined as a customer expressing an interest in using a brand's product or service.)</p><p> Rather than jumping on the opportunity to engage with their audience, Brandwatch found that less than 1% of the 72,756 brand mentions of the 200 B2B businesses that it analysed over a two month period were then acted upon by companies. Frankly, that's a shockingly low amount and, according to the researchers, equates to nearly $36 billion in lost revenue. All for the sake of responding to a comment and starting a conversation!</p><p> Daily brand mentions ran into the thousands, too. Collectively, these top 200 B2B brands received an average of 5,055 daily mentions on news websites, 2,935 on chat forums and 2,623 on blogs. Every day!</p><h3> And where exactly were most of these brand mentions happening?</h3><p> <br/> In a word: 'Twitter'. As you can see from the chart below, almost 75% of all B2B brand mentions occurred on this platform alone - a stunning endorsement of Twitter's lead generation credentials.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,h_2000,q_80,w_1200/v1/75010/Twitter_73_pb2slq.jpg\"/><p> <br/> To quote directly from Brandwatch's report: 'The proportion of brands with no account or no activity is incredibly high at 42%. While competitors are benefitting from using Twitter for customer service, lead generation, recruitment and much more, reluctant B2B brands are falling behind the curve.'</p><h3> So why aren't B2Bs engaging with this vast audience?</h3><p> <br/> Natalie Meehan, a marketing insights analyst at Brandwatch, notes that social media gives B2B brands \"a wealth of potential sales opportunities.\" But in order to get the most from these opportunities, they needed to be \"better educated in the areas they need to be active on and uncovering these conversations before they die out, or worse, end up in the hands of a competitor who is doing a better job of monitoring than them.\"</p><p> Meehan is spot on. If you don't a) start listening in to what's being said about your brand then b) start engaging with your social media mentions, it won't be long before somebody else steps in and takes those sales leads right from under your nose.</p><p> One more stat to conclude: on average, Brandwatch calculates, top B2B brands receive 363 potential sales opportunities from social media each year...uncannily close to one new business lead, per brand, EVERY SINGLE DAY, including high days and holidays.</p><p> Still think your B2B can get away with not having a well-structured, properly-resourced social media marketing strategy?</p><p> You can download Brandwatch's excellent B2B Social Media Report report, in full,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.brandwatch.com/b2b-report/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u></p>",

    "content": "<p> I am going to put it right out there and probably make a few new enemies:</p><p> Pretty much all the referral generation techniques and methods you&rsquo;ve ever been taught and have tried won&rsquo;t work with the majority of consumers today.</p><h3> The great Gordian Knot for professional services is unravelling referral reluctance.</h3><p> <br/> One of the most valuable pieces of research for professional advisers in recent years provided the clues to unravelling it however.  A report published by Vanguard in 2012 after more than 100,000 consumers had been surveyed over a period of some years revealed the correlation between:</p><p> 1. High levels of engagement with clients</p><p> 2. Having highly satisfied clients</p><p> 3. Getting Referrals from clients</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/satisfied-clients-and-referrals-copy.jpg?w=610&amp;h=169\"/></p><p> The two standout conclusions are:</p><p> 1.  A massive proportion of clients are happy enough with their adviser, and are satisfied with what the adviser does.</p><p> 2.  Being happy as a client does not translate into providing referrals to the adviser.</p><p> So all of the fabulously clever referral-generating techniques, the gazillions of sales training dollars invested over the years in countless numbers of advisers, and good service levels provided to the overwhelming majority of clients by the overwhelming majority of advisers (as judged by the clients), still result in very few clients providing a referral.</p><h3> I am not surprised in the slightest by that.</h3><p> <br/> What I am surprised at is the proportion of industry participants and sales-training providers still thumping the concept that one just has to ask a cleverly constructed question at precisely the right moment in order to slash this particular Gordian Knot.  While I absolutely agree that one has to build in the systems and processes of positioning the professional and setting the expectation of being referred, and furthermore that one needs to be thinking about the psychology of the consumer and carefully selecting the words we use when doing so, those things are simply not enough to get clients providing referrals consistently.</p><p> Perhaps many professionals have been too busy to notice, but the world has changed from 25 years ago.  Consumers expectations have changed.  How they find information and choose to use advice mixed in with self-management and DIY options have changed.  Their choices have broadened enormously.  Consumers expectations regarding service and cost have changed considerably. Why would we think that techniques taught in the 1950&rsquo;s through to the 1970&rsquo;s would still be the most effective way of generating new business today?</p><p> What will produce consistent streams of referrals from clients in todays world is a relentless commitment to remaining highly engaged with clients individually, and continually staying in front of their ever-increasing service and support expectations. We live and operate in a world of personalisation and individual agenda&rsquo;s, and are expected to deliver accordingly.</p><h3> The words one uses when talking to clients about being referred certainly matter.  </h3><p> <br/> So too does the timing and positioning of any referral discussion.  But what will make THE difference is that process of continual engagement at an individual level which results in clients feeling as if you are absolutely there for them.</p><p> When they are engaged to the point where loyalty is a two-way thing and they think your advice and service levels are awesome, THEN you can expect the referrals to flow.  Unravelling this particular knot really is a &ldquo;strand by strand&rdquo; operation &ndash; there is not a magic set of words that will cut the knot for you and have referrals flowing in immediately.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I was talking about the internet of things again today, and realised that I have a grand vision of the not too distant future where everything communicates with everything.  We have chips as tiny as nanodots inside every brick, pavement slab, tyre, wall, ceiling &hellip; you name it.  We have more intelligent chips inside car engines, visual entertainment systems (the TV is no more), wearable devices from rings to necklaces to bags to shoes.  Everything is communicating with everything and our devices are all attached to us through the blockchain.</p><h3> The result is that my Star Trek vision of no one paying for anything becomes a reality. </h3><p> <br/> I drive to the big city and park.  My car tells the metering system it&rsquo;s my car and it&rsquo;s parked here until I come back.  When I come back it asks the system how much it owes and pays.  I do nothing.</p><p> My car then drives me to the gas station &ndash; I don&rsquo;t drive anymore as it&rsquo;s self-driving &ndash; and it asks the station robot for $30 of LPG.  The robot pump system delivers and I just sit, working and enjoying the entertainment and world around me.  The car drives off and all of the transaction is seamlessly in the background.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve asked my Tesla to take me downtown to a decent bar &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t been in this town before &ndash; and it delivers me toJoes 99er.  I have no idea who Joe is or why he&rsquo;s talking 99 and I don&rsquo;t care, I just want a drink.  Joe &ndash; or the guy behind the bar &ndash; gives me a large Whisky and Bud.  It&rsquo;s my usual tipple and my shoe just told his stock management system that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d want.  I felt a little vibration from my shoe that confirmed this would be ordered and just let it go.  It was too much trouble to shake my left foot for a Gin &amp; Tonic.</p><p> After three Buds and Whisky combos, I jump back in the car and am ready to hit the casino.  The car asks me three times if I really want to do this &ndash; it knows what happened last time &ndash; and I just say yea.  I&rsquo;m cool and mellow and a little bit drunk, something I&rsquo;m ultra-aware of as I&rsquo;m supposed to be sober in charge of a self-driving car.  Why that law still exists, I have no idea.</p><p> So the car drops me at Caesar&rsquo;s Shed, it&rsquo;s kinda five steps down from the Palace, and I start shooting some Blackjack.  My shoe vibrates again, as I&rsquo;ve just lost $2,000 in the first five minutes and my budgeting balance for the month for gambling has been reached.  But it&rsquo;s only June 2nd for heaven&rsquo;s sake.  I stamp my foot and the balance is lifted, along with a healthy top-up of $10,000 moved from my savings account in real-time.</p><p> By the end of the evening, my savings are gone and the bank&rsquo;s given me a loan of $15,000.  I hate it when I click my shoes together and say there&rsquo;s no place like home.  After all, that&rsquo;s the trigger for my biometric check to ensure it really is me saying that I want an extra line of credit.  No-one notices the heartbeat check and the touch of my finger to the side of my glasses.  Works every time.</p><p> Unfortunately, it works and makes sure that I lose every last dime of my money but then I have this lady who seems to have joined the ride home, and the car is asking where to go.  I say home with an S (for seduction), and the car heads to my destination of choice.</p><p> As we arrive, the nest is bathed in purple light.  Ed Sheeran schmoozes Thinking out Loud from the wireless speakers and we&rsquo;re soon enjoying an intimate moment.  As our bodies touch, something in my ring tells me a transaction just happened.  It is only then, with the combination of my gambling losses and Bud combos, that I realise this is no ordinary woman as I gather she&rsquo;s not here for a long-term relationship.</p><p> In fact, the following morning, as my red eyes open and realise she&rsquo;s gone, that the sun rises on my virtual walls and my infomediary assistant tells me my account has been frozen.   It just goes to show that the shoes I brought last month really are a bad influence.  Next time, I should stick to the watch.</p><p> Ah well, a good night was had by all and not a payment or authentication was visible to all.  Just wireless credits and debits from the stamp of a shoe to the touch of an eyebrow. </p><h3> The world has changed a lot in the last ten years. </h3><p> <br/> I remember in 2010, I used to keep lots of pocket change in my car to pay parking metres, and got frustrated with the endless stops at toll booths to swipe my credit card.  By 2015, things had improved immensely.   Now I just had NFC payments, prepaid apps and one time passwords.  No longer would I jiggle around trying to find the right change.  My tech would help me to sort out the detail.  Now, my tech just does it all for me.  I just try to work out : was it all worth it?</p>",

    "content": "<p> This is the second part, in a 2 part series on how Advisors can get the most mileage out of their  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/4-keys-to-the-practice-of-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content marketing  </a> </u>  through repurposing. In  <u>  <a href=\"/sell/content-marketing/secrets-of-content-marketing-how-advisors-can-make-their-content-go-further\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   part 1  </a> </u> , we looked at the following three types of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/secrets-of-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content repurposing  </a> </u> :</p><li> E-Newsletters</li><li> Infographics</li><li> E-Books</li>Advisors can take their existing content and multiply it by turning content and blog posts into different types of content. Repurposing your content puts your content in front of a different audience that may not see you on other marketing channels or other formats. In summary, the benefits of content repurposing include:<li> Makes the most of your content, ideas and research.</li><li> Focuses on different aspects of the topic or presentation.</li><li> Reaches different audiences by offering your content in different formats and publication periods.</li>In part 2, we will look at three more ways in which Advisors can repurpose and reformat their content in order to extend the reach of their content and identify further link-building opportunities:<h3> Webinars</h3>Whether you&rsquo;re walking your audience through some tips, a process, presentation or concept, webinars are a great way to present your existing content in an interactive online experience while also building a subscriber base for future content. Holding a webinar is also a great way to introduce yourself and your business and start building a brand name. The audience can put a face to your business as well as interact with you through a real time question and answer periods. Not only is a Webinar an effective way to repurpose content, it also helps to build credibility and creates a connection and trust between yourself and the attendees.<h3> Social Media Posts</h3>Take your blog posts and turn them into small snippets of your content on Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin, driving them back to the original post on your website. Social media gives you the opportunity to create conversations around your content. For example, if you&rsquo;ve written an article on retirement planning, tweet the question, &lsquo;&rsquo;How can you balance saving for retirement without sacrificing today&rsquo;s priorities?&rsquo;&rsquo; with a link to your article. This will not only get people looking at your content, but will also help to drive engagement.<h3> Slide Share/Presentation</h3>Make a list of bullet point takeaways from your blog articles that people would get from reading it. Perhaps it is the main idea of the post, a statistic or quote, a supporting idea or an actionable tip. You can create a new slide for each bullet point that you listed from your blog post, grab some images for each point, and turn it into an insightful PowerPoint presentation. Speakers will often put their slide decks on <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> SlideShare</a> and the content will do really well for those who couldn&rsquo;t attend a Webinar, or a speaking event. SlideShare is a slide hosting service that allows users to upload and create slide decks from their PDFs or PowerPoint presentations. SlideShare has a strong online community which will help you to drive traffic from within the community and from search engines. You can also embed your SlideShare presentation into one of your web pages.Quick tip:  How can you get started with repurposing your content? Take an inventory of all of your existing content whether it is a blog article, brochure, pitch book, video, etc. Create a spreadsheet and list all of your existing content and ideas on how this content can be split up or repurposed into a different format.",

Keynes).</li><li> <strong>  Avoid leverage </strong> &ndash; It can offer more upside but the risk of the loss of capital is often not worth the reward</li><li> <strong>  Understand liquidity </strong> &ndash; It should always be placed at a premium.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t forget taxes </strong> &ndash; Many great sounding strategies don&rsquo;t factor in the impact of Uncle Sam (see our past &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/ideas/what-would-yale-do-if-it-was-taxable/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  What Would Yale Do If It Was Taxable </a> &rdquo; post).</li><li> <strong>  Only invest in what you understand </strong> &ndash; Do not be sold.</li><li> <strong>  History tends to repeat itself </strong> or at least rhyme (thank you Mr. Twain) &ndash; Try to learn from the past mistakes of others &ndash; The investment world certainly offers us many mistakes to learn from.</li><p> <br/> Finally, please consider only investing in what makes you feel comfortable.  Demand transparency and remember that simplicity often wins over complexity. </p><p> I cannot promise that these rules will always bring you the highest returns (see rule #1 &ndash; don&rsquo;t make investing a competition), but experience has taught me that they do help investors achieve goals and increase peace of mind. </p><h3> What is comfort and peace of mind worth? </h3><p> <br/> I am not sure but for many, in a world that is pretty fast paced and complex, it might be like the MasterCard ad: &ldquo;Priceless&rdquo;</p>",

    "title": "Best Practices for Best Execution",
    "link": "best-practices-for-best-execution",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Michael Conlon</p><p> As an investment advisor, the duty to seek best execution arises from the core fiduciary duty and the related duties of loyalty and care for your clients. In seeking best execution for your clients, the advisor's duty focuses on your firm&rsquo;s obligation to seek the best available trade execution when exercising discretion to trade on behalf of your clients. While the concept can be subjective it is an important element of the fiduciary duty owed to clients since the costs of trading have a material impact on portfolio performance, especially over years of management.</p><h3> Best Execution In a Nutshell</h3><p> <br/> Regulations state that as fiduciaries, registered investment advisors owe their clients a duty to seek and obtain &ldquo;best execution&rdquo; on securities transactions, under the circumstances of the particular transaction.</p><p> It is important to note that this does not necessarily mean &ldquo;lowest trading fee&rdquo; or &ldquo;most favorable execution price&rdquo; but rather, the best qualitative execution quality that is available to the advisor at that time.</p><p> While commission rates are certainly a component of determining best execution, the explicit &ldquo;cost to trade&rdquo; is just one of several factors to consider. Advisors may also consider the full range and quality of a broker&rsquo;s services, including:</p><li> Value of research</li><li> Execution capability (e.g. minimizing market impact, liquidity, order size)</li><li> Financial responsibility or solvency (e.g financial strength of broker-dealer)</li><li> Responsiveness of the broker-dealer</li><li> Availability of price improvement</li><li> Cost effectiveness, including related clearing and settlement impacts</li><p> Below we describe some specific guidelines you should follow based on your firm&rsquo;s specific circumstances.</p><h3> Discretion to Select Brokers vs. Recommending Brokers</h3><p> <br/> If your firm has brokerage discretion (see Item 8.C.3 on your Form ADV Part 1, and Item 12 of your Form ADV Part 2A) this means that, on a trade by trade basis, your clients have given you the ability to determine which broker-dealer will execute each transaction. In this case, you will be expected to demonstrate the rationale behind broker selection for each trade, relying on factors such as those listed above.</p><p> If your firm does not have brokerage discretion but rather you recommend brokers to your clients (See Item 8.D on Form ADV Part 1), then your client is formally selecting the broker-dealer to be used for their trades, which is typically noted in the client advisory agreement. They are doing so based on your recommendation, usually because your firm has a preexisting relationship with a recommended custodian that executes and clears your client trades, based on your prior best execution diligence. In this case, your compliance duties are lighter than a situation where you have brokerage discretion, and firms are obligated to monitor and assess this broker-dealer/custodial relationship on a periodic basis, and confirm that your factors supporting the recommendation continue to remain valid.</p><h3> Single vs. Multiple Brokerage Relationships?</h3><p> <br/> Regardless of whether your firm uses one or multiple broker-dealers, you are required to &ldquo;periodically and systematically&rdquo; evaluate the quality of execution services received from each.</p><p> In either case, you are expected to monitor and review formally, at least annually, the arrangement(s) in place with your broker-dealer(s) to confirm that the total transaction costs paid continue to be competitive when compared to other alternatives available to your firm. A key point here is that the formal diligence on your best execution compliance is geared towards what is best for your client and supports your assertion that you are upholding your fiduciary duty to your clients by ensuring they receive best execution as a client of your firm.</p><p> A common misperception is that if you utilize just one broker-dealer (and your firm simply recommends that broker-dealer) then there is no evaluation or due diligence requirements. However, this is not the case, because that broker-dealer could be providing inadequate execution for your clients.</p><h3> Through the Regulator's Eyes</h3><p> <br/> Since the concept and determination of best execution is in many ways a qualitative one, it may be helpful to view it more as a process. Regulators need to evaluate your firm to ensure it has a process of continuously assessing the overall execution services provided to your clients, after considering the facts and circumstances that prevail, such as discretion, strategy and due diligence.</p><p> A common examination request from regulators is for a copy of trade blotters for a specific period of time that identifies the executing broker, as well as any documents created in the evaluation of brokerage arrangements and best execution.</p><p> The latter can be satisfied by providing the regulator with a copy of your Annual CCO report, which should include a section on vendor due diligence and best execution assessment.</p><p> Regulators expect your firm to be able to answer questions such as:</p><li> Is our current line-up of broker-dealers the best available?</li><li> Are there alternatives to this line-up that could provide our clients with a better deal?</li><li> What factors are considered when evaluating a particular broker-dealer for your clients?</li><li> How frequently do you perform diligence on broker-dealers and could you provide me the historical diligence documents? <br/>  </li><h3> CCO Best Practices for Best Execution <br/>  </h3><li> Review the &ldquo;Brokerage Practices&rdquo; section of your compliance manual to confirm that the policies and procedures laid out here are being followed.</li><li> Review the brokerage-related disclosures in your ADV Part 1 and 2A for consistency with your compliance manual and current brokerage activities.</li><li> Review execution performance of brokers on an ongoing basis, paying particular attention to commission rates paid and quality of execution and settlement (i.e quality execution prices, low error rate on order management and trade settlement).</li><li> For any brokers you recommend to clients, perform a review of your relationship of each broker at least annually, to assess the full range and quality of the services your firm receives based on best execution factors (i.e. value of research, execution quality, commission rates, financial responsibility and responsiveness) to ensure the recommended brokers would provide best execution for your clients.</li><li> If you have brokerage discretion, implement a process of periodically reviewing your trade blotter to monitor broker usage at the firm- and client-level, as well as by security type.</li><li> Document your brokerage review process in your Annual CCO Report and related assessments.</li><li> Review your investment advisory agreements to confirm that they are consistent with your brokerage discretion disclosures and brokerage practices.</li>",

    "content": "<h3> Is your business gathering data to build a persona model of its ideal clients based on demographic data?</h3><p> <br/> There is an increasing trend towards businesses creating persona model client categories based on insights into the known income and spending patterns of people along with their job positions, ages, education, home suburb and other public information. These firms often say that they are adopting a behavioral approach to their sales and marketing activities. Although, in reality, they are only capturing surface behavioral information.</p><p> Building a persona model of the client is still a very rational &ldquo;left-brain&rdquo; approach to sales and marketing. What is missing is knowing what the client really needs and how they wish to be related to at an emotional level. We advocate that businesses should incorporate a &ldquo;right brain&rdquo; approach to know how to communicate with clients?based on their personality style. Let us address this key point to show you the future of marketing and sales in the New Behavioral Economy.</p><h3> Knowing the persona of the client may at best tell you &ldquo;what&rdquo; they want.</h3><p> <br/> The persona models assume that everyone in each category is the same based on their demographics. For instance, retail companies gather this data to know what type of clothes or vacations certain people (ie persona&rsquo;s) want. Certainly, this approach has merits for a basic and perhaps even necessary level of client segmentation. There is no point selling a product or service to a person who is not even capable of paying for it. For instance, retail companies gather this data to know what type of clothes or vacations certain people (ie persona&rsquo;s) want. An insurance or bank may gather this information to offer certain types of insurance or investment products to their prospects and clients. However, is this persona model approach achieving the optimal result of providing each client with customized life-long experiences?</p><p> Gallup Organization research in 2009 shows that those firms who are able to emotionally engage their clients will increase revenues by 23% a year over those who do not. A personal model approach will help client segmentation but will not boost emotional engagement. Emotional engagement can only be boosted by the business adopting strategies which help the employees demonstrate that they understand the core of who their clients are. This is why we recommend a personality based approach which involves the client completing a short online questionnaire that has been independently validated. Such an approach will help the firm and its employees serve each client on their unique terms. Further, if the right technology platforms are used the data will be scalable across the whole business on a continuous basis.</p><p> Therefore, we recommend:</p><h3> The New Behavioral Economy Formula of: Persona Model (What to sell) + Personality (How to relate and sell).</h3><p> <br/> Introducing personality discovery to the sales process in a scalable way will have a significant impact on sales. Even if your firm only increased its sales by 1% in year 1, the bottom line return will be huge. But, there is no reason why you cannot increase sales by 10% or more a year.</p><p> A personality based approach to marketing and sales assumes that each client is wired differently. Meaning that regardless of their assets, income, living conditions, education or age they will have a pre-disposition to make certain types of choices, have certain purchasing biases, and communication needs. Put another way, 2 people within the same persona model will have different emotional triggers and communication styles based on how they are wired. They will want to be related to differently. Typically, there are 4 broad quadrants where 92% of people have a dominant personality style. Although, given each person is unique they will have secondary factors, and more specific sub-factors.</p><p> Lets take a simple example of an insurance life protection policy offered to 2 people in the same persona model. Some people will need to know how the policy being offered achieves their goals, others their lifestyle, others security for their family and others the details of how it impacts their retirement plan. At a broad level, the policy has the same objective however how each person needs to hear the offering to buy it is different.</p><p> The same example can be used in gaining insight into how an insurance firm will distribute a new insurance protection policy to its field force. The advisors and agents in the field who meet a minimum sales quota are not the same personality. So, to be successful in sales they need a customized approach for being related to by the home office (or their general agent) and being educated about the product. Then, a customized approach needs to be developed for how each advisor or agent builds relationships and sells the product to their different clients.</p><p> In summary, building a persona model of your firm&rsquo;s prospects and clients is a positive first step in segmentation. However, given it is rational in nature, such an approach will not build sustainable client engagement. That can only come from understanding the personality of all your employees and clients.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Sunny skies and warm weather is on the horizon and if you&rsquo;re like me, vacation time is calling your name. Summer has a tendency to zap employee engagement. In fact, <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/summer-destroys-workplace-productivity-2012-6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a Captive Network study  </a> </u> shows productivity drops 20 percent during summer months.</p><p> Employee engagement, combined with company culture, is a hot topic right now. Firms are looking for ways to incorporate actionable plans to keep team members engaged, productive, and happy. Each element directly impacts predicable levels of success and the bottom line.  </p><p> With advanced planning, you can integrate strategies that support a healthy work-life balance. Here are a few tips advisory firms we work with use.</p><h3> Promote Health and Well-Being</h3><p> <br/> Tap into fitness and fun. Offer yoga classes, life coaches, meditation practices, healthy lunches, gym memberships, or a personal nutritionist. Practicing healthy lifestyles with a group is fun and holds everyone accountable.  </p><h3> Offer Flexibility</h3><p> <br/> A popular option to spike morale is to adjust work hours. Consider enabling team members to come in later, leave early, or even start the weekend sooner by adjusting Friday hours. Employees who have more autonomy over how, where, and when they work manage job responsibilities better and tend to complete their work in less time allowing more time for fun.  </p><h3> Encourage Vacation</h3><p> <br/> A study by <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shrm.org/pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Society for Human Resource Management  </a> </u> found the majority of professionals believe employee wellness, morale, performance, and productivity are improved when vacation time is a priority. Those who use vacation time are healthier, less likely to suffer from burnout, and have higher energy and creativity levels contributing to the success of your firm. Leaders need to encourage everyone to &lsquo;unplug&rsquo; from work by enjoying long weekends and taking vacation. Download the report here: <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shrm.org/Research/SurveyFindings/Documents/14-0028%20JobSatEngage_Report_FULL_FNL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement/ The Road to Economic Recovery  </a> </u></p><h3> Make Your Environment Fun</h3><p> <br/> Set time aside for relaxation. Host a company picnic, an all-expense paid visit to an ice cream truck, or an in-office chair massage. Small events like this elevate spirits and keep employees on track and focused.</p><h3> Create Summer Goals</h3><p> <br/> Review goals with team members. Employee engagement spikes when there is an understanding of how individual contribution relates to the success of your firm. Pinpoint a few small goals to complete during summer months and demonstrate how each project will provide favorable outcomes for everyone.</p><h3> Hire an Intern</h3><p> <br/> A summer intern can provide extra support on projects, fill in during vacation time, and offer fresh ideas. Assign an intern to serve as a personal assistant to team members for a specified amount of time. Empower employees with authority to direct the intern that best supports completion of any projects and responsibilities. </p><h3> Provide Positive Reinforcement</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t overlook the value of saying &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; Appreciation doesn&rsquo;t need to be expensive. Schedule time to meet with your team at the beginning of summer to spawn renewed interest, energy, and reduce the risk of low engagement levels. The key is to express gratitude on a regular basis, not just during annual reviews.</p><h3> Offer Paid Time &ldquo;ON&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Offer employees paid time to volunteer at their favorite charity or community organization. Practicing acts of kindness is linked to happiness and creates a culture of gratitude that boosts morale and is healthy for your business. </p><h3> Provide Additional Training</h3><p> <br/> Just because it&rsquo;s summer doesn&rsquo;t mean training should come to a halt. Employers who promote personal development reap the benefits of skilled, knowledgeable, confident, and satisfied personnel. Offer learning opportunities through webinars or online training tutorials directly related to job functions.</p><h3> Utilize Motivational Speakers</h3><p> <br/> After I listen to a motivational speaker, I&rsquo;m fired up and ready to tackle whatever comes my way. Schedule a motivational speaker each month during the summer. By sharing stories of adversity and achieving goals, they provide inspiration, increase engagement, and productivity. <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TED talks  </a> </u> has a library full of motivating resources you should utilize.</p><p> Show your team you value and understand the importance of a healthy work-life balance by offering opportunities to them to take a break from daily stress. In the long haul, you will boost employee engagement, morale, and loyalty.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Doug Thoreson</p><p> Expectations can be funny things: with high expectations, anything less than great can end up as a disappointment; with low expectations, something mediocre can be a pleasant surprise. It goes along with the old adage: always under-promise and over-deliver.  <strong>  The way something is perceived &ndash; such as a recently released movie &ndash; is frequently tied to the expectations that precede it. </strong></p><p> A few weeks ago, when &ldquo;Avengers: Age of Ultron&rdquo; was released in the United States, it became the 2 nd  - largest grossing movie in its opening weekend in U.S. box office history, with a staggering $191 million in only three days of showings. Normally, this would be a coup for any film. In one weekend, Age of Ultron was already on pace to be one of the highest-grossing films of all time.</p><h3> Yet, this is where expectations begin to factor in.</h3><p> <br/> The first Avengers movie, released in 2012, is the one movie that &ldquo;Age of Ultron&rdquo; failed to surpass in its first weekend. This took some of the shine off of &ldquo;Ultron&rsquo;s&rdquo; impressive financial success. Many predictions leading up to opening weekend had &ldquo;Ultron&rdquo; passing its predecessor for no. 1 on the all-time list, and there was a solid basis for this: all sequel films in the Marvel cinematic universe had outgained their predecessors on opening weekend. When &ldquo;Ultron&rdquo; failed to live up to this history, the narrative  shifted, and the story became less about the success of the sequel or the sustained success of the &ldquo;Avengers&rdquo; franchise and more about how much farther behind projections &ldquo;Age of Ultron&rdquo; could expect to fall.</p><p> As the &ldquo;Ultron&rdquo; example shows, figuring out the right way to set consumer expectations is tricky &ndash; companies will always want to market new products as superior to all things that preceded them. Being too low key will not be successful, because with no buzz there will be no sales. But consumers will be disappointed if an overly hyped product does not live up to what was promised.</p><p> <strong>  Some companies pride themselves on having their expectations line up with the consumer experiences: </strong></p><li> Last year, Stubhub announced &ldquo;all-in pricing&rdquo; so that customers could see the final price of their tickets, as opposed to paying tax and convenience fees at checkout</li><li> Zappos proudly offers a 100% return policy and receives top customer service ratings.</li><p> Through over-delivering on achievable expectations, companies are able to create sustainable levels of customer experiences that will lead to loyalty and advocacy.</p>",

Don&rsquo;t allow another year to pass without some completely out-of-the-box behavior.</p><p> You never know when crossing a few old-school boundaries may change a student&rsquo;s or a colleague&rsquo;s life, while bringing the joy back to your teaching.</p><p> 35 things you should do before school ends</p><p> <strong>  1 &ndash; Change your countdown. </strong> Instead of counting down the days remaining before summer break, count the days until the new school year begins. It cultivates a love of learning.</p><p> <strong>  2 &ndash; Celebrate success. </strong> Forget everything that you&rsquo;d consider a failure, and focus on the successes in your class and at your school. Now, share them with everyone.</p><p> <strong>  3 &ndash; Holster that movie. </strong> There are much better ways to engage learners at the end of a school year. Your students have all summer to stare at TV.</p><p> <strong>  4 &ndash; Go outside. </strong> The weather is turning, and students are eager to escape that stuffy classroom. Take a walk around campus; recite poetry while sitting on the grass; climb a tree.</p><p> <strong>  5 &ndash; Clean out lockers and desks before the last day of school. </strong> I had a principal once who scheduled locker clean-out once every six weeks. This was a brilliantly simple idea.</p><p> <strong>  6 &ndash; Play music. </strong> It soothes the savage beast and kids, too.</p><p> <strong>  7 &ndash; Hang out at the library. </strong> Is there a better place?</p><p> <strong>  8 &ndash; Eat ice cream. </strong> Plan to have the ice cream truck stop outside your school. Then, buy your students a cone. Have one yourself and let it drip down your chin.</p><p> <strong>  9 &ndash; Play a prank on a colleague. </strong> This is great for team building. Involve kids, and help them understand the boundaries involved in this age-old practice.</p><p> <strong>  10 &ndash; Spend a day on social media. </strong> If done right, students may learn more this day than any other.</p><p> <strong>  11 &ndash; Break out in song. </strong> It may be terrifying, but boy is it fun.</p><p> <strong>  12 &ndash; Dance. </strong> If students don&rsquo;t join in automatically, you must not look silly enough.</p><p> <strong>  13 &ndash; Have an Open Mic day. </strong> For a cool twist, encourage students to make jokes about your subject or to do their best imitation of you.</p><p> <strong>  14 &ndash; Write teacher evaluations. </strong> This one is risky, but asking students to evaluate you and your class can enrich your teaching like nothing else.</p><p> <strong>  15 &ndash; Eat pizza. </strong> Just because it tastes so good.</p><p> <strong>  16 &ndash; Tell everyone to take off their shoes. </strong> Sure, it may get a bit smelly in your classroom, but it&rsquo;s so relaxing. You might consider combining this one with number 4.</p><p> <strong>  17 &ndash; Bring in a guest speaker. </strong> Make it someone unexpected and fun&ndash;crazy even. Remember, it&rsquo;s not always about connecting to your subject area. The goal is to keep students engaged when they just want it to be over.</p><p> <strong>  18 &ndash; Wave a magic wand. </strong> Tell students they can change anything in your class or your school with a magic wand; absolutely anything goes. This is fun and you never know when it just might work.</p><p> <strong>  19 &ndash; Produce a movie. </strong> With amazing tools like Animoto and Magisto, it&rsquo;s super easy for kids to create wonderful videos. Encourage them to make an important statement about the school year.</p><p> <strong>  20 &ndash; Write a letter to next year&rsquo;s students. </strong> This is an oldie but a goodie. You learn so much about yourself and your methods when reading what students write about you.</p><p> <strong>  21 &ndash; Teach kindness. </strong> This is a good one for anytime, but it&rsquo;s especially important to emphasizebeing kind to students, as they head off to a long summer.</p><p> <strong>  22 &ndash; Break out the crayons. </strong> Try to color inside the lines.</p><p> <strong>  23 &ndash; Tell a secret. </strong> See how long your students can keep it.</p><p> <strong>  24 &ndash; Start a book club. </strong> Invite students to discuss it over summer break on a social network. <a href=\"http://goodreads.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Goodreads </a>  is a great place for this activity.</p><p> <strong>  25 &ndash; Make that kid feel special. </strong> You know the one. Sure he annoyed you for most of the year, but he had his reasons. Spend a couple of days doing all you can to make him feel like the most important kid you teach.</p><p> <strong>  26 &ndash; Challenge your students like never before. </strong> Give them a seemingly impossible task. Tell them it may be too difficult; then, help them in any way you can, without helping too much.</p><p> <strong>  27 &ndash; Teach them to reflect every single day. </strong> Ask them to consider how they might be better tomorrow.</p><p> <strong>  28 &ndash; Help a colleague. </strong> Someone at your school needs a shoulder to cry on or a helping hand. Be there. You&rsquo;ll feel good about it.</p><p> <strong>  29 &ndash; Maintain a journal or blog. </strong> Reflect on your practice. Write about what you do well and where you can improve.</p><p> <strong>  30 &ndash; Hug a student who needs it. </strong> There was a time when I thought this was crossing a line. I&rsquo;m so glad I learned that it&rsquo;s part of a teacher&rsquo;s job.</p><p> <strong>  31 &ndash; Laugh at yourself. </strong> Self-deprecating humor is a teacher&rsquo;s best friend.</p><p> <strong>  32 &ndash; Make kids feel safe. </strong> They need this most.</p><p> <strong>  33 &ndash; Read to them. </strong> Yes, even high school kids.</p><p> <strong>  34 &ndash; Tell students you believe in them. </strong> Harvard professor Ron Ferguson&rsquo;s research actually says this will make them perform better.</p><p> <strong>  35 &ndash; Tell them you&rsquo;ll miss them. </strong> Before they leave for summer break and a new teacher or maybe a new school, tell your students you&rsquo;ll miss them. They&rsquo;ll love you for it.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Are we living in the Twitter end times? </strong></p><p> I don't mean to imply that Twitter will cease to exist any time soon. It may well hobble on, broken and vanquished, like Yahoo or AOL, forever; and like AOL, it may well find a loving foster home (or caregiver organization that can suck the lifeblood out of its marrow before kicking it into the ditch, as the case may be). <br/> <br/> What I mean to imply by \"end times\" is that Twitter has long since peaked in popularity and is now clearly on a difficult path, a trajectory of travail. Dick Costolo has had almost two years (since the IPO) to turn Twitter, the public corporation, into a money-making business. That effort has failed. The company continues to burn through $50 million a month (in net losses) while struggling to keep its user numbers above 300 million. Meanwhile,  <u>  <a href=\"http://recode.net/2014/02/07/twitters-other-growth-problem-keeping-the-users-it-already-has/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   over a billion people have tried Twitter  </a> </u> , and most of them have moved on. <br/> <br/> Ben Thompson gives a good summary of Twitter's problems in  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/twitter-needs-new-leadership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  his blog post of 29 April 2015 </a> . He points out:</p><p> Twitter&rsquo;s MAU [monthly active user] numbers are not necessarily what they seem, particularly from an advertising perspective. The company disclosed last year that 14% of its MAUs never visit Twitter&rsquo;s website or apps; rather, these users have connected 3rd-party applications and websites that don&rsquo;t display Twitter ads; for example, you can log into Twitter from Instagram in order to post a link to a photo. Moreover, that number doubled over the previous year, a stark contrast to Facebook&rsquo;s 5% figure. Worse, a sizable portion of those users may be lapsed completely; according to Twitter approximately 8.5% of MAUs are due to applications that automatically ping Twitter without any user involvement.</p><p> One example of such an application was iOS 7 Safari: in Twitter&rsquo;s 2014 4Q results the company blamed its slowing user growth numbers on iOS 8, which ended Safari&rsquo;s practice of pinging Twitter for its Shared Links whether or not the logged-in user ever read that section. The proper interpretation, though, was not that Twitter&rsquo;s user growth numbers were accidentally and temporarily slowed, but rather that the company had been over-counting MAUs for at least a year. Add in the fact that, according to Twitter, up to 5% of MAUs are likely spam accounts, and it&rsquo;s fair to wonder just how many people are actually being served ads from Twitter&rsquo;s advertisers.</p><h3> The real numbers are probably far worse than Ben Thompson is saying.</h3><p> <br/> The idea that only 5% of users are fakes, bots, or scammers is ludicrous; it's far more likely to be north of 10%. As I  <u>  <a href=\"http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2015/04/plot-twist-your-internet-friends-are.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reported last month  </a>  , </u> 24% of CEO Dick Costolo's own Twitter followers are abandoned accounts, bots, fakes, or otherwise defective.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-2.42.38-PM.png\" width=\"426\"/> <br/> <br/> Also, there's the problem of duplicate accounts. Many of Twitter's most active users (including advertisers, of course; for example, Google) have multiple accounts.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/green-coffee-and-spam-elaborate-spam-operation-twitter-uses-nearly-750000-accounts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   One spammer recently created over 700,000 individual accounts  </a> </u> . </p><h3> And then there's the bot problem. People buy and sell bot-created \"Twitter users\" by the thousands now.</h3><p> <br/> And then there's the \"adult content\" problem. If you're an advertiser, you probably don't want your Promoted tweet to land next to a spread-eagle shemale selfie, or other explicit material. <br/> <br/> The problems go on and on, but the main problem is: advertising on Twitter doesn't seem to be making financial sense for a lot of advertisers. This is a hard issue to dodge, because with modern analytics, it's possible for an advertiser to calculate and track, to the penny, what a customer acquisition costs. Because of the Google-inspired auction system used by Twitter, a single click on a link or Order button can cost an advertiser as much as $20. Or maybe it's \"only\" $2. But the point is, either way, that cost gets tracked, and ROI gets calculated, and at the end of the day there's absolutely no uncertainty around the question of whether a given Twitter ad campaign was successful or not. <br/> <br/> If you read  <u>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/twitter-needs-new-leadership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ben Thompson's analysis  </a> </u>  (scroll down to his \"Worrying Signs From Advertisers\"), it doesn't sound like advertisers are seeing proper ROI. <br/> <br/> And then there's TWTR, the stock.</p><p> Twitter's quarterly results famously  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/04/28/twitter-selerity-leak-tweets-earnings/26528903/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  leaked to the outside world </a>  shortly before the close of trading on April 28 (results were broadcast via the Twitter account of data-mining company Selerity), sending the stock down almost 20%. The stock had been trading at $51 before the leak. It was at $37 three days later and still hasn't recovered. Around $8 billion of market cap vanished. What was a $32 billion (market cap) company is now a $24 billion company.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-2.42.51-PM.png\" width=\"254\"/> <br/> For Twitter stock to come back, the company (barring a sudden merger, massive layoffs, or change of management) would have to do two things. At the next earnings announcement, the company would have to show evidence of a turn toward profitability; and it would have to show evidence of a pickup in user numbers. A failure on either one of those items will result in the stock going down. (A profit alone won't save the stock. A growing user base speaks to future earnings prospects. That's what Wall St. cares about; that's how the stock is valued.)</p><h3> I expect to see two things happen, in the coming weeks.</h3><p> <br/> First, more ads in more timelines. Costolo and his CFO, Anthony Noto (who has taken over Marketing), are probably going \"off the rate card\" right now with big advertisers, cutting special deals right and left. They know they have to bring more money to the bottom line. That's a no-brainer. <br/> <br/> The second thing I expect to see is some kind of purge of the user base (maybe beginning with the much-anticipated  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/16/twitter-s-great-porn-purge-of-2015-porn-stars-and-xxx-companies-fear-the-worst.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   porn purge  </a> </u> ) to remove bots, fakes, inactives, and undesirables. This will stir up a lot of dust and allow Costolo to do a reset on user numbers. \"Sure our numbers are down this quarter!\" he'll be able to boast. \"Of course they are. We purged the list!\" It will be impossible to know, meanwhile, what the true dropoff in users was, for the quarter. Attention will focus on earnings-per-share. Or so Costolo will be hoping.</p><h3> I don't think these things will be enough.</h3><p> <br/> I've talked to operators of several mid-size Twitter accounts (50K followers) and they agree with me that engagement numbers seem to be going soft. One of them said: \"Six months ago, I had 36,000 followers and could count on 3,000 impressions per tweet. Now I have over 40,000 followers and I'm lucky if a tweet gets past 2,400 impressions.\" Another person asked me if I thought Twitter was throttling traffic, the way Facebook now does. (\"I doubt it,\" I said.) <br/> <br/> Those of us who've been with Twitter a long time (since 2009, for me) know that Twitter is its own peculiar beast; it shouldn't be compared to Facebook or other social sites. And that's true, but it's also true that in any product space, there's rarely room for more than two players at the very top (Coke and Pepsi, for example), and if it comes down to Facebook being Coke, the only Pepsi that makes sense is LinkedIn, which (unlike Twitter) is all-business, with great demographics and a great story for advertisers. If advertisers decide to write only two checks a month in the social space, one will be to Facebook. The other won't be to Twitter.</p><p> <strong>  And to that extent, we may be living in the Twitter end times. </strong> <br/>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Just one hundred years ago, to live until sixty was a great feat, given that the life expectancy was around fifty-one years for men and fifty-five for women. Now, centenarians&mdash;those 100 or older&mdash;are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. Currently, there are about 53,000 centenarians in the U.S. and, because this group is increasing at the rate of 75,000 people per year, there will be 600,000 centenarians by 2050. That&rsquo;s right!  Ten times  as many Americans will be over 100 years old two generations from now. Research of Dr. Mario Martinez&mdash;a study of 700 healthy centenarians from all over the world&mdash;reveals that centenarians share similar characteristics.</p><p> What causes us to die? Certainly there exist many factors. However, one of the common threads is stress. Stress arises from activation of what I have called the automatic brain, which is our body&rsquo;s inherent mechanism that causes us to fight or flee anything our brain perceives could be dangerous. The electrochemical response this causes releases elements that cause us to experience stress. But it also wears our body down. Studies using compounds called beta blockers, which block the electrochemical fight-or-flight reaction, find that those animals, insects, or humans exposed to them tend to live longer.</p><p> Here are some of the similar characteristics of centenarians:</p><p> <strong>  1. They are rebels who don&rsquo;t go along with the beliefs of their cultures. They create their own culture. </strong></p><p> An inner confidence helps us feel safe no matter what the circumstance, thereby blunting any stress response. Independent thinking, when rational and appropriate, can lead to self-confidence, security, and a sense of inner peace.</p><p> <strong>  2. They don&rsquo;t go to doctors to keep them well. Many of their doctors are dead, and they tend not to align with traditional Western medicine. </strong></p><p> Traditional, conventional, or Western Medicine tends to be physician focused rather than patient centered. This mean, doctors (most of my colleagues, actually) tend to view patients as needed to be fixed rather than empowering them to learn how to fix themselves. Having a sense of self-empowerment and personal responsibility creates a feeling of control and safety within one&rsquo;s body and environment and centenarians seem to have this. </p><p> <strong>  3. They indulge in pleasurable rituals daily, like one cigar, a small scotch, or a brownie. The key is it&rsquo;s a ritual&mdash;think tea ceremony not a mindless binge. </strong></p><p> Strict rules and restrictions can cause stress and living by them on a daily basis can wear us down. Moderation and self-control have the opposite effect.</p><p> <strong>  4. They live in the present and look forward to the future. They have events and new challenges to look forward to. </strong></p><p> Regrets of the past can lead to depression and insecurity&mdash;two very powerful activators of stress. Knowing that a well-lived present will lead to a safe future is a secure feeling and one that relieves and prevents stress.</p><p> <strong>  5. They do not identify with their peer groups or identify with age&mdash;they don&rsquo;t like being around what they call old people, many of whom are younger than they are. </strong></p><p> How many times have you heard people say &ldquo;It sucks getting old&rdquo;? Well those are exactly the people with whom centenarians don&rsquo;t associate (and with whom we should not either). Harboring bad thoughts about yourself as you age creates an inner disharmony, imbalance, and inevitably causes stress.</p><p> <strong>  6. They live in subcultures that support maximizing their ability to live agelessly. </strong></p><p> Living amongst others or creating an environment that supports living while still alive is much different from living in environments that supports dying. While we are still alive we owe it to ourselves to keep living. And this is a solid approach whether you are 105 or 55.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I again have learned the significance of choice.  So many times I would grumble about having to do this or that.  Recently, I was taught a valuable lesson.  It's a change of perspective that caused great liberation and optimism.  It's the concept that says the following:  \"I don't have to do this, I get to do it.\" That subtle change of view I believe can cause great impact.</p><p> This has caused me to think of financial services clients.  I know sometimes it is very difficult to wake up and do certain things each day.  Sometimes we dread just one of our to-dos that it causes us to procrastinate the entire day.  Numerous books have been written on the topic. Sometimes, one of the toughest things to do is to contact clients that you either have bad news to share with, don't want to talk to or simply may not like.  Or sometimes you fear what tangent they may go off on, or what new questions or challenges they may introduce. More than just saying I must call them today, how about considering saying, \"I get to call them today.\" That's right, you don't have to call your client ever again; you GET to call your client today.</p><p> After all, this is your chance to set yourself apart, deliver on your noble calling and build multi-generational wealth and trust with them.  Not a bad reason to call. Perhaps we should look forward to the privilege of helping our clients do what they say they want to do.</p><h3> I was reminded of this simple, powerful concept again when I had the chance to meet a baseball legend - Ernie Banks.  </h3><p> <br/> I have referenced the meeting I had with Ernie a few times in my posts.  As you can tell, my meeting with him had a significant impact on me. </p><p> As I have mentioned before- for those who don't know him, he is \"Mr. Cub.\"  He played for 19 years for one team, one owner, in one city, for one mayor, in one stadium, under one light - the sun.  He is a member of the baseball Hall of Fame, The 500 Home Run Club and his number is retired from the Chicago Cubs and hangs on the foul pole in Wrigley Field.  He is known for his optimism and positive spirit.  It is said that he coined the phrase \"Let's play two.\" A phrase he used every day there was a ball game to show his love for the game.  It's worth noting that he played only day baseball in Wrigley Field (under the July and August heat) and he never won a championship with the Cubs.  (But then again, no one has since 1908.)</p><p> When I first met Mr. Banks, it was one of life's surprises that seemed to occur- if we are aware, conscious and available.  It came at a time that I had been pondering a concept I titled \"regret minimization.\"  The concept, simply stated, is doing those things in life that you think about but rarely, if ever, act on.  That's when this meeting opportunity came to me.  And as you can see, I acted.</p><p> I met Ernie on a Tuesday at 11 am.  And I can sincerely say I am wiser and more optimistic because of that encounter.</p><h3> What did I find?</h3><p> <br/> He was fresh with relevant, creative business ideas, energy and most of all optimism.  He talked about core principles, perseverance, history, family and loyalty. One of the reasons I wanted to meet with him, I hate to confess, was to see if this reputation of optimism that was older than I, was real.  Or, I had thought, was it trumped up? Was it simply lore, legend, a sweet old story? \"Let's play two\" is a phrase every Chicago Cubs die-hard fan knows. It was, as legend has it, how Ernie greeted every baseball game he played. Kind of the glass is half full mentality. Was it real?  I wanted to know.</p><p> This lore - this genuine optimism - was real and still is!  He is the real, genuine thing. His optimism, attitude and legend was not a gimmick, it was part of his being.  I walked away from the meeting a better man for just spending three hours with him! That is a rare gift.</p><h3> Do your clients feel that way after a meeting with you? </h3><p> <br/> Do mine?  Why not?  How can they? Do we crave a spirit of optimism, desire a view of the world that is liberating, need new perspective and  simply want to be better for knowing someone?</p><p> I believe Mr. Banks has another story to be told, not just that of his life, his baseball career and his baseball success.  He has many stories of perseverance, triumph and pure joy.  Those are the stories that truly last. This is what makes legacy. This is what needs to be honored and held up for example to the youth.</p><p> The other reason I wanted to meet him is because I am a cynic.  After I met him, another thought came into my mind.  A thought I'm not proud of. I wondered quietly if he was thinking clearly. Glad it was not the primary thought, but overtime, life does this to you if you are not careful.  The stresses of the world, the disappointments of people, the culture of bigger and better causes you to consider, look for and find the negatives that may or may not truly exist.  After hearing him with great clarity and excitement share several business ideas with me, I had this urge to simply dismiss him.  Discard the ideas not on their merits, but rather because they were coming from this \"old man.\" In reality, I thought, I was discarding him, not simply his ideas.   I wondered if perhaps he was not thinking as clearly as someone half his age, who by society's standard would be a captain of commerce, a business leader. But a man of his age, simply should be left behind to smile and rock.  So goes the \"silent generation\" of today.</p><p> And then it hit me.  Why?  Why would I think that?  Have we as a society discarded the wit, wisdom and wealth from our wisest and most experienced citizens?  Do we think they are finished contributing?  I sure hope not! This meeting was a great reminder for me, and perhaps hopefully you, that there are indeed great things to learn, experience and act on that come from the most treasured people group on earth today - those who have lived long and lived well - the so called silent generation. Many of those people are your clients. Additionally, this group still has much to contribute - we ought to let them. We ought not to silent them! So again, aren't you lucky, you GET to call your clients today and they get to talk to you?</p><h3> Enjoy the game, and begin believing again-believing in yourself and in other people.</h3><p> <br/> Think about it, you get to call your clients today! You sure are lucky.</p>",

    "title": "‘The Last of the Doughboys' by Richard Rubin",
    "link": "the-last-of-the-doughboys-by-richard-rubin",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: David M. Shribman</p><p> They haven&rsquo;t disappeared yet. World War I veterans, that is. The last one may have died more than two years ago, but Richard Rubin&rsquo;s new volume, &ldquo;The Last of the Doughboys&rsquo;&rsquo; brings them back, the last few survivors of the Great War, for one more march on the parade ground of history. For a long while they were forgotten but not gone. Now, thanks to Rubin, they are not forgotten.</p><p> Rubin interviewed dozens of the last doughboys when they were between the ages of 101 and 113, no easy task &mdash; not easy to find them, not so easy to converse with them. Some were sparing of speech, reflecting spare memories. Others were fountains &mdash; overflowing fountains &mdash; of recollections.</p><p> One of the loquacious was J. Laurence Moffett of Orleans, 106 at the time of his interview and the last surviving member of the fabled Yankee Division, remembered now almost exclusively on highway signs in the Boston area. His recall was so clear that he was able to summon the number of each fighting unit from each state comprising the 26th Division. (The 101st Regiment Infantry was from Massachusetts.)</p><p> One of the most memorable was Anthony Pierro of Swampscott, vivid in my own North Shore memory, interviewed at 107. His discharge papers affirmed that he was of excellent character, had served in Battery E of the 320th Field Artillery, and had fought in major 1918 battles including Oise-Aisne, St. Mihiel, and Meuse-Argonne.</p><p> This is an engaging book, with wonderful tangents &mdash; diversions, they would have been called in the war &mdash; on such subjects as the songs of the conflict (&ldquo;What are you going to do for Uncle Sammy?/&thinsp;What are you going to do to help the boys?&rsquo;&rsquo;); another on books produced during or by the war (&ldquo;The Soldier&rsquo;s French Phrase Book&rsquo;&rsquo; and &ldquo;A Yankee in the Trenches&rsquo;&rsquo;); still another on war resistance, patriotism, and the pressures felt by immigrants in America (advice to the wise: &ldquo;Put a flag at your door, another on your coat, and above all keep one in your heart.&rsquo;&rsquo;)</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-10.45.26-AM_0.png\" width=\"326\"/></p><p> But &ldquo;The Last of the Doughboys&rsquo;&rsquo; is memorable mostly because of the memorable doughboys it tracks down.</p><p> Like Arthur Fiala, who traveled across France in a boxcar marked &ldquo;40-8,&rsquo;&rsquo; meaning it could be occupied by 40 men or eight horses. Or Reuben Law, a fanatical diarist whose entries for Oct. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in 1918 read simply: &ldquo;Sick.&rsquo;&rsquo; Or Howard Ramsey, who drew an especially grim assignment: starting a new cemetery in France that we now know as the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery.</p><p> Here is part of Ramsey&rsquo;s testimony: &ldquo;So I remember one night, it was cold, and we had no blankets, or nothing like that. We had to sleep &mdash; we slept in the cemetery, because we could sleep between the two graves, and keep the wind off of us, see?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p> Rubin traveled widely, employing a keen eye. He noticed, for example, how German cemeteries in France for World War I dead were populated with tablets in the shape of the Ten Commandments for the Jewish dead, and noting of the Germans who returned to France in the next war: &ldquo;And yet, though they had four years to do so, they never touched those Jewish markers in their own military cemeteries, never tried to destroy this evidence that Jews were a part of Germany, too, and just as willing, and able, to die for their country as anyone else.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p> And of course there was the fabled Frank Buckles, who died Feb. 27, 2011, the last member of the American Expeditionary Forces. He had joined the Ambulance Corps and had what the British sometimes call a &ldquo;good war,&rsquo;&rsquo; first in England, then in France. He never saw action against Germans but he did escort 650 of them, prisoners, back home. Later he was detained during WWII by the Japanese.</p><p> Buckles&rsquo;s death made the papers, and made Rubin think about its meaning. His demise, Rubin says, &ldquo;creates additional degrees of separation between us and the event; reshapes it in our consciousness, breaks it down and reassembles it in a somewhat less solid state, one that is harder to grasp, and to carry.&rsquo;&rsquo; True enough. But his book succeeds by creating degrees of connection, even as it reshapes our consciousness.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Week&rsquo;s back, getting ready for March Madness, I wrote a short blog post on  <u>  <a href=\"https://encorepartners.com/how-do-you-define-your-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John Wooden&rsquo;s view of success  </a> </u> .  I included a link to a video he recorded for TED talks.  I was blown away by the large number of folks who stopped to thank me for writing this post.</p><h3> Coach Wooden obviously touched a lot of lives</h3>One client said he would never forget hearing Wooden speak at a conference, &ldquo;He was nothing short of amazing, with his wit, intellect and recall as he used zero notes or prompts.  I still get misty eyed when I think back to that opportunity to hear him and meet him in person.&rdquo;Another said, &ldquo;I can remember crying when I heard he died.  Coach Wooden has been a lifelong inspiration.&rdquo;<h3> Those are just a couple examples of lasting impact.</h3>Of leaving things better than we found them. <strong> As Wooden himself might say&hellip;the peace of mind that comes from doing your best in every endeavor.</strong>And though we don&rsquo;t all have the global reach of a legend like Coach Wooden, we touch people&rsquo;s lives everyday.  Whether it&rsquo;s your team, your clients, your family or your community, you leave an impact.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s big or little.<h3> It comes down to the way you play the game.</h3>With this in mind, I decided to share some thoughts from Robert Wren, Encore&rsquo;s Business Development Specialist.  Robert, a huge fan of Coach Wooden, gave me the idea to write the first post.Here&rsquo;s what he wrote&hellip;As the second full week of NCAA March Madness comes to life I thought it would be useful to reflect once more on the life of John R. Wooden.  As many fans of basketball know, Mr. Wooden is considered among the greatest college basketball coaches ever.  His record of 10 NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball Championships is considered untouchable with almost zero possibility that any other NCAA head coach can ever eclipse his standard.In deeper reflection upon Coach Wooden, perhaps it&rsquo;s his uncanny wisdom that leaves his greatest legacy.  Much of it is preserved forever in the many quotes that came from teaching his players the game and the game of life.  As I pause to reflect on each one, I can apply them directly to what it takes to achieve ultimate success as a financial advisor.  I easily find parallels between the philosophy driving his achievement and how they would apply to our work.<h3> But first, there are facts about Wooden that sometimes get lost in the enormous success he had at UCLA</h3>As a player at Purdue, he was the first ever consensus NCAA All-American.Before he won his first NCAA championship, he had already been enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a player.In a short professional career, he once made 134 straight free throws in games.He considered leaving UCLA with one year left on his ($6,000 annual salary) initial contract in 1950 to take a coaching offer from his alma mater Purdue, but reneged as he felt &ldquo;he would not have lived up to his word.&rdquo;He coached at UCLA for 13 years before making it to his first Final Four in 1962, where UCLA actually lost in both the Semi-Finals and Consolation round.Upon retirement from UCLA in 1975 after winning his 10th and final NCAA Championship, he turned down a financially lucrative offer to coach the hometown NBA franchise Los Angeles Lakers.As you can tell, Coach Wooden was a champion in many aspects of life. Integrity, never quitting and striving to be the best were hallmarks of his life.<h3> Here&rsquo;s my &ldquo;sweet 16&rdquo; of his many words of wisdom that I feel apply to advisors today</h3><li> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little details that are vital. Little things make big things happen.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Failure is not fatal, but failure to change might be.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let praise or criticism get to you. It&rsquo;s a weakness to get caught up in either one.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Never mistake activity for achievement.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not making mistakes, then you&rsquo;re not doing anything. I&rsquo;m positive that a doer makes mistakes.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t measure yourself by what you have accomplished, but what you should have accomplished with your ability.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what you learn after you know it all, that counts.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Be true to yourself, help others, make each day your masterpiece, make friendship a fine art, drink deeply from good books &ndash; especially the Bible, build a shelter against a rainy day, give thanks for your blessings and pray for guidance every day.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up on your dreams, or your dreams will give up on you.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t live a perfect day without doing something for someone who will never be able to repay you.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Talent is God given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Never make excuses. Your friends don&rsquo;t need them and your foes won&rsquo;t believe them.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.&rdquo;</li>I hope you enjoy these quotes.  I hope at least a couple of them really stick with you in the days and weeks to come.  They each remind me of the work we do with our clients&hellip;.helping them build world class advisory businesses.<h3> Helping them turn ability into peace of mind and greater achievement.</h3>Please let us know if we can lend you a hand.",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Dan Wheeler | <a href=\"http://wheelerwrites.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Wheeler Writes  </u> </a>  </p><p> When commissions were banned in both the U.K. and Australia, I applauded their Regulators, who took a stand for investors against the Financial Industries in their respective countries.  It was a long time coming but it is now a reality.</p><p> Having witnessed these developments I began to speculate whether or not such a ban could ever be implemented in the U.S.  Being aware of the strong financial ties between Wall Street and politicians of both parties, I have been skeptical that such reforms could ever become law in the U.S.</p><p> However the debate has begun.  The arguments against banning commissions are twofold:</p><h3> 1. &ldquo;The small investor will be left out of the advice market.&rdquo; </h3><p> <br/> Excuse me?  That should be one of the main objectives of any legislation.  Small investors are exploited more than others because they are sold the products with the highest commissions.  Otherwise it is not worth the sales person&rsquo;s time.  Once people realize they are being ripped off, they will be motivated to invest some time learning how to invest their savings.  I used to say, if people would spend as much time making investment decisions as they do when making decisions about which car to buy, they would have a much better investment experience.</p><h3> 2.&ldquo;Thousands of jobs will be lost in the Financial Services Industry.&rdquo; </h3><p> <br/> This brings back memories of when I would write about &ldquo;conflicted advice&rdquo; in Investment Advisor Magazine.  I would get emails (maybe it was &ldquo;hate mail&rdquo;) accusing me of destroying the sender&rsquo;s career.  My response would be, &ldquo;if your career is based on ripping people off, perhaps a new career may be needed.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Both of these arguments are what I would expect.  They put the Financial Services Industry&rsquo;s interest ahead of the investors&rsquo; interest.  Wall Street is not going to roll over without a fight.  There is too much money at stake.  Rather than simply ban commissions, they will likely settle for a slight tightening of the rules regarding their fiduciary responsibility that requires them to put the investors interest first and no doubt the training syllabus for new brokers will include a course on &ldquo;how to comply with the law while still maximizing commission income.&rdquo;  If that is all the reform does, enforcing such a rule will be cumbersome and expensive.</p><p> Simply banning commission would be a much more effective way to protect investors and be a lot less expensive to all parties involved.</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So, if I&rsquo;m going to learn, I must do it by listening.&rdquo; &mdash;Larry King</p><p> One of the most important leadership skills, that outstanding leaders have mastered, is the ability to listen. Genuine listening is one of the key ways you can show your strength as a leader; it shows confidence and establishes trust. As Larry King said in the quote above, the only way you are going to learn anything is by listening. Sounds simple enough, but so few people listen like a leader. When you listen like a leader, you listen with the intent to gain true understanding, you show respect to others, you make real connections, and you build mutual trust.</p><h3> Understanding</h3><p> <br/> Leonardo da Vinci believed, &ldquo;The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.&rdquo; Outstanding leaders are insatiably curios; they ask open-ended questions that challenge the status quos and help others to reframe problems and ideas. In order to gain a true understanding you must leave your own agenda at the door and learn to recognize your biases so that you are open to really understanding what others have to say. You must encourage people to not only share their thoughts, but to dig deeper into what lies beneath those thoughts. Recognize that everyone has something valuable to contribute and take the opportunity to reach across the organization, listening like a leader with the intent to gain understanding.</p><h3> Respect</h3><p> <br/> Bryant H. McGill tells us, &ldquo;One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say.&rdquo; Outstanding leaders understand that it&rsquo;s not all about them. Listening to others is the ultimate sign of respect and it shows you care. It demonstrates how much you value and respect the experience and knowledge of others when you ask for their input. People want to be consulted and know that they&rsquo;ve been heard and their ideas are taken under serious consideration. Show that you respect their opinions and are confident enough to welcome others to challenge, question, and disagree with you. Admit when you are wrong or don&rsquo;t have the answer. Ask the questions that will have a real impact and then listen like a leader to what others have to offer.</p><h3> Connection</h3><p> <br/> Rollo May said, &ldquo;Communication leads to community, that is, to understanding, intimacy, and mutual valuing.&rdquo; An outstanding leader looks for connections and develops personal relationships by really listening to others. You let them know you care about what they think and about their ideas when you truly listen. You must create a safe place for people to open up and share knowledge, ideas, and opinions. Listening like a leader allows you to find the connections that transform relationships and teams.</p><h3> Trust</h3><p> <br/> Stephen Covey explained, &ldquo;Trust is the glue of life. It&rsquo;s the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It&rsquo;s the foundational principle that holds all relationships.&rdquo; Outstanding leaders build trust by proving they are good listeners. Leadership is all about influence and if you want to have an influence, others have to know they have been heard. Listening shows that you value the thoughts of others, that you are worthy of their trust, and encourages them to continue to communicate. Listen like a leader and develop the trusting relationships that allow you to influence others.</p><h3> How to Do It</h3><p> <br/> So, how do you listen like a leader? You listen without having an answer or response already in mind; don&rsquo;t just listen to confirm what you already think you know. Let others know that you hear them and that you care about what they have to share. You ask questions and follow up. You put yourself in their shoes so that you can empathize with their point of view. You limit distractions and give your undivided attention. You not only pay attention to what is being said and how they say it, but also to what is not being said. You talk less and listen more to gain understanding, show respect, uncover and develop connections, and build trust. Then, and only then, will you be listening like a leader.</p>",

    "content": "<p> You, as the reader, will learn one important thing in reading this today: effective change management as a key ingredient in preventing the perception of failed projects and change initiatives.</p><p> There are a multitude of factors at play to see a project or change through successfully from start to finish. First, it is important to understand how far out the initiative reaches. Regardless of the business, change needs to be identified and addressed at all levels: program level, organizational level, project level, and product level. This hierarchy touches on changing the approach to company vision (program level), changing people/ roles and processes (organizational), specific project scope changes and changes in technology, and product or service features (product level). At any one level there are multiple variables to keep in mind and sometimes missed variables can lead to delays or ultimately, failed projects. So, what is the key to achieving a successful initiative?</p><p> Out of all the factors, Leadership plays a key role in program and project success. To combat project stress and/or ambiguity across the organization, a leader should facilitate project success by:</p><p> <strong>  1) </strong> Establishing clear expectations of the project (not just the due date) and it&rsquo;s alignment with the organization&rsquo;s overall objectives.</p><p> <strong>  2) </strong> Prioritizing all major enterprise efforts and emphasizing the need for organizational resource planning. Budgets for key projects should include back-filling key operational roles so the Subject Matter Experts are working on the project. Asking your best functional resources to work the project off the side of their desk seldom works and can be a key contributor to failure.</p><p> <strong>  3) </strong> Ensuring a culture where two-way communication is encouraged:</p><p> <strong>  1. </strong> The people who are setting the scope, budget, and timeline need to listen to feedback from the people who will be responsible for executing those deliverables before committing to a plan. To encourage unity and team accountability, the people setting the direction need to be held equally accountable as the people delivering.</p><p> <strong>  2. </strong> Encourage a culture of Relationship Change Management by ensuring the team is having an ongoing dialogue with key stakeholders. This open dialogue should be present at every phase of the project from the team selection through post-implementation support in order to ensure buy-in and ownership. Those efforts with a dedicated Communication and Change Management role, where activities are tracked in the project plan, will have better results.</p><p> <strong>  3. </strong> Practicing honesty with oneself. Too often, as leaders, we want to believe something will cost less, take less time, and provide more benefit than the reality. C level executives need trusted messengers who are closer to the work to provide them with unfiltered information, especially if the news is bad.</p><p> <strong>  4. </strong> Spending more time ensuring the key roles are filled with people who have the right experience, skills, and natural behaviors to ensure success.</p><p> <strong>  5. </strong> Holding people accountable which also includes enforcing a culture of quality assurance. Motivate team members using both the carrot and the stick methods. Bonuses tied to project deliverables can be very effective if they are meaningful and permeate all levels of the project. Removing a problem person from the project catches people&rsquo;s attention as well.</p><p> <strong>  As a leader, it is important to remember that the two-way communication should be incorporated in every aspect of the project and organization. </strong> This will ensure that your organization is operating on the most accurate facts and can therefore, affirm the success of a project or change initiative. Setting up such a unified culture is most effective when it starts with the leader.</p>",

    "content": "<p> While resistance to change continues to be alive and well in many organizations, the world is changing every day. We are in a time when entire economies, organizations and industries are transforming. And yet, we use antiquated organizational change management practices in our 21st century world. The biggest change leaders need to make is to have clarity on the shared purpose of their organization and how to deliver on it in a simple way where employees understand their roles.Change is inevitable. And what is needed is a total mindset change and not a program that can be delegated to a team to do on behalf of the senior executive team. Today, we need less sponsors of change programs and more owners. We need a generation of leaders who understand why change is important to the business and their accountability to implementing it. We need to get back to business basics and stop this insanity. It will save organizations a lot of money in the long run. The question leaders need to be asking themselves today is does your organization know how to transform as the needs of your customers change?</p><h3> And we need leaders with a new mindset</h3>The 21st century leader needs to view themselves as a connector and community builder as they will need to bring the best people to solve problems; regardless of whether they are employees, contractors, consultants or partners. They will also need to break down the walls between functions and select ideas that can be converted to what their customers wants and need and get paid for it. And having the right leader is key to taking an idea to market. Organizations will need to define their most critical projects around their products and services and be aware of how many real leaders they have who can deliver results. Why have 56 projects running in your organization if there are only 7 real leaders who can bring them to the marketplace? It goes way beyond a title on a business card. In the 21st century, organizations need a 21st century leader:<img alt=\"\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-21-at-10.23.09-AM.png\" width=\"368\"/><h3> Why is this important?</h3>There is one main reason: you don&rsquo;t want to be left behind and have your business become irrelevant. I&rsquo;ve already shared my thoughts around <u> <a href=\"http://www.itbusiness.ca/blog/how-to-stop-the-band-aid-solutions-for-21st-century-leaders/53918\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  21st century leadership </a></u> in an earlier post, and we now need to understand the mindset of the 21st century employee.<h3> What do we need to know about today&rsquo;s employees?</h3>If you want to understand the 21st century employee, you have to understand the new human (aka the new consumer). This is the first time in the history of work where we have more access to technology tools that give each of us a voice outside the corporate walls. In our daily life, we can each search for the best restaurants and hotels and read other people&rsquo;s online reviews. We can also add our own when we have a great experience and more often, when we have a terrible one. Outside the work environment, we have a voice and can share our feelings whenever we want.Too often, this changes when we come to work where we cannot express our voice openly as there are processes and procedures that dictate how employees are allowed to communicate. Many employees have inboxes overflowing with emails trying to push us to communicate in the online collaborative space and we can give feedback once a year in the annual employee survey. We don&rsquo;t have the ability to have open, ongoing conversations because we are so busy being governed by the Google or Outlook calendar monster that takes us from meeting to meeting every day. And we ask ridiculous questions like should our employees be our brand ambassadors? Why would you not want your employees to have a voice and pride in what they do? Who better to convey the passion and purpose of your organization in the world?Too often, this changes when we come to work where we cannot express our voice openly as there are processes and procedures that dictate how employees are allowed to communicate. Many employees have inboxes overflowing with emails trying to push us to communicate in the online collaborative space and we can give feedback once a year in the annual employee survey. We don&rsquo;t have the ability to have open, ongoing conversations because we are so busy being governed by the Google or Outlook calendar monster that takes us from meeting to meeting every day. And we ask ridiculous questions like should our employees be our brand ambassadors? Why would you not want your employees to have a voice and pride in what they do? Who better to convey the passion and purpose of your organization in the world?How have we lost so much common sense when it comes to business? It&rsquo;s time to get it back and have an understanding of the 21st century employee and why change is inevitable as it will start coming from the people who show up at work. Organizations that understand that this century is about collaboration and co-creation leave fear and scarcity behind, to pursue opportunities by creating new markets, services and/or products. They will also kill the annual employee survey and re-institute ongoing conversations and feedback into their very fabric.<h3> This is how 21st Century Employees shows up at work:</h3><img alt=\"\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-21-at-10.23.45-AM.png\" width=\"739\"/>Meaning: Pursues their <u> <a href=\"http://www.itbusiness.ca/blog/lifeworking-in-abundance-in-the-21st-century/55027\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  lifework </a></u>&ldquo;If one wanted to crush and destroy a man entirely, to mete out to him the most terrible punishment,&rdquo; <u> <a href=\"http://literaryjukebox.brainpickings.org/post/43630040705\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  wrote Dostoevsky </a></u>, &ldquo;all one would have to do would be to make him do work that was completely and utterly devoid of usefulness and meaning.&rdquo;The 21st century employee shows up as one person. She doesn&rsquo;t buy into the work-life balance myth as she looks at how does her work fit into her life. She has an understanding of who she is and the impact she wants to have in the world. And this is not just about the Millennial generation and younger people. This employee also includes older generations who are now redefining success and realizing that working 24/7 is no longer tenable or desirable. An increasing number of people are currently questioning their relationship with work and are starting to pick themselves, which is why 50% of US workers will be free agents by 2020. People will no longer need to retire if they are doing their life&rsquo;s work. They might choose to do something different but they won&rsquo;t need to plan their escape from a job as work will just be part of our lives.Meaning becomes far more important, which means there is a need to have a clear understanding of the organization&rsquo;s purpose and how your employees can help achieve it. Authentic two-way communication becomes critical. There will be less canned messaging and more leaders who can inspire teams to achieve shared goals. The world for the 21st century employee is not pursuing the myth of work-life balance but doing their life&rsquo;s work, which means how does work fit into our lives?<h3> Choice: Has a voice inside and outside the organization</h3>The 21st century employee wants to share his voice. We still need a level of governance and policies to protect the organization, especially in highly regulated environments, but instead of asking silly questions like should our employees be brand ambassadors, leaders tap into the collective expertise of  the people they spent months hiring and on-boarding and now retaining. The 21st century employee has a mindset of abundance. He knows that there are many opportunities for himself and for the organization because he is no longer confined by fear and scarcity. There is enough. The 21st century employee has a strong desire to make, do and create and be part of something bigger than himself.In the 21st century, employees don&rsquo;t wait to be picked; they pick themselves. Because they have an increasing amount of choice. When a person is doing their lifework, they are no longer governed by fear of losing their job. Over the next decade, for example, we will see more people taking vacation days and respecting themselves rather than the crisis we are witnessing today, where $54B in vacation was unused due to fear in 2013. When we have a choice and can express it, we have a voice. This new employee is  looking to be part of organizations that thrive on <a href=\"http://www.itbusiness.ca/blog/in-the-21st-century-we-need-less-powerpoint-and-more-conversations/53011\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> conversations</a> and <a href=\"http://www.itbusiness.ca/blog/you-should-work-out-loud-in-the-21st-century/54674\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> collaboration</a> and bring the outside in.<h3> Harmony: Collaborates and co-creates with others</h3>There will still be plenty of jobs where people can be independent in their work. But as organizations start focusing on the key problems and opportunities they need to address to be successful, they will need to bring people together to deliver on them. The 21st century employee understands that being part of something bigger than her is going to be more personally fulfilling. She has a strong desire to collaborate and co-create with others. She understands that innovation is not a department but a way to experiment on what&rsquo;s possible with others. Just take a look at how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theranos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Theranos</a> disrupted the $70B blood testing industry with a new business model.Organizations will need to re-think how they measure success. While many messages that are being shared today are about the team, the metrics that measure success are still based on individual performance. There is a need to radically transform the performance review process from an annual, individualized process to one that helps people deliver shared purpose and measure shared goals. Your collaborative goals will not be achieved if you don&rsquo;t infuse new ways of working that allow for true collaboration.<h3> Network: Has a robust connected community</h3>There is a big difference between a connected network and a trusted community. A network includes people you are connected to who you may not have deep relationships with, where a community includes people you trust and who trust you and usually has a common purpose.Because the 21st century employee has a voice and wants to create, he has a robust network of people to tap into both inside and outside of the organization. One of the main reasons we were able to position Cisco Canada as the number two revenue generating country for the company in 2012 was because our strategy focused on the deep relationships our employees had in key communities. The 21st century employee shows up at work with existing connections and builds new ones. He wants to tap into his network and work within trusted communities and not organizational departments. Organizations that get it know how to build thriving online communities where employees can work and co-create.<h3> Co-creates: Learns through dialogue</h3>Many organizations are looking for ways to motivate employees who are seeking meaning in their work. From accountants to product development managers in large organizations, the search for purpose is everywhere. Co-creation projects are a powerful way to ensure employee satisfaction. More of us will see our working lives structured around short-term project based teams and more of a &ldquo;Hollywood model,&rdquo; where a team comes together and works as long as is needed and then disbands. Just like making a movie and bringing the best director, costume designer and editors, organizations will need to bring the best people with complimentary skills to co-create.Often, these projects will be complex and will need more dialogue to get everyone up-to-speed on what needs to get done. This works for the 21st century employee who learns from co-creating with others through dialogue. Like the movie and television business, storytelling becomes much more important in the future of work as sharing of information quickly becomes key.<h3> Impact: Cares locally, regionally and globally</h3>An increasing number of employees want to see the impact their organization is making in their local community and the world. Millennials, relative to older generations, are all about giving back to communities that align with their core values and they are asking hard questions like where does the organization source its products and what does it do for the community? And we don&rsquo;t talk enough about the shift that is taking place with all generations in the workforce, a reconnection to impact. The 21st century employee wants not only to have meaning and impact in the work he does, he also wants that impact measured.Today, most organizations use antiquated measures for success that measure activity and do not track the impact. It&rsquo;s usually an after thought to figure out if we what we did had the results we aspired to. We spend energy on the new technology that needs to be implemented by a certain date and don&rsquo;t necessarily track its impact and then we wonder why it was not successful. If we have leaders who have a mindset of measuring impact, we will attract and retain the 21st century employee who is seeking value in his contributions. The beauty of technology is that it allows us to live in an open and connected world where we can build new communities and it also has made us increasingly conscious that we have a responsibility to our local, regional and global world. The new employee brings these beliefs to work and wants to work for organizations that make a difference. And it&rsquo;s an opportunity for private sector organizations to find new ways to market by co-creating unusual partnerships across sectors on the edge.<h3> Mobile: Wants flexibility and personalization</h3>The 21st century employee is mobile where the devices simply allow them to connect any time, any where. Mobile is not just a technology anymore; it&rsquo;s a way of life and work for the 21st century employee who wants flexibility and personalization. And yet many organizations take a transactional view of mobile and think about it as a technological device or remote working.Leaders need to truly understand the opportunity that mobile provides and its importance in creating the future of work in the &ldquo;Hollywood model.&rdquo; New technologies like Enterprise 2.0 solutions need to be integrated in how we work so those conversations can take place outside the scheduled meetings where work actually happens. Video becomes increasingly important in the future of work in connecting us through conversations. Organizations that can tap into employees any where and connect them through video will be the ones 21st century employees will thrive in. Imagine the impact of reducing carbon footprint with being allowed your work in a mobile environment. And imagine a mobile workforce that has impact in the organization and the community. This is the new canvass we should be painting together.<h3> Are you ready?</h3>The 21st organization needs to be created. We need to move away from antiquated  management practices so we can tap into the hearts and minds of people who want to do their lifework. As a futurist, my job is to analyze trends and prepare leaders for what&rsquo;s coming in the world of work and life. I hope this article helped you start thinking about what you are doing and the shifts you need to make. I look forward to having conversations on this. And I leave you with one question: &ldquo;are you ready?&rdquo;",

    "content": "<p> Growing up in a family-owned business, the never-ending exhaustion was something I came to view as normal. My parents owned a restaurant, wanted it to be successful, and worked every hour they could to do that. Makes sense, right?</p><p> Wrong.</p><p> I see it everyday among fellow entrepreneurs, small business owners, and even clients. A feeding frenzy that never ends, a rush to do it all, be it all, learn it all &ndash; as fast as we can. Compete, run, compete, RUN, go &ndash; go!!</p><p> But what are we sacrificing?</p><p> We live in a culture that glorifies the &lsquo;busy&rsquo; person and looks down on someone who takes a vacation. I&rsquo;ve even heard a few entrepreneurs brag about how long it&rsquo;s been since they took a vacation!</p><p> How is this affecting our health, our mental capacity to handle stress, to balance life, to enjoy the present, and to grow as individuals and business owners?</p><p> Do we really believe that living at this pace is bringing out the best in us?</p><p> For me, it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m actively trying to make right in my life &ndash; sleeping, taking breaks, resettling my mind and giving my body the exercise it deserves. But it&rsquo;s not easy.</p><p> I fall victim to the addiction of work all the time. I find myself back at my laptop when I don&rsquo;t need to be there. And I have issues putting away my cellphone at bedtime.</p><p> Why are we doing it? Success? But what is the definition of success? Is it building a family? Watching children grow up, filling the bank with cash or being able to travel the world?</p><p> We all have different definitions for success and they&rsquo;re all equally important. But we can&rsquo;t attain achievements of any kind without making investments in the most important asset we have &ndash; ourselves.</p><p> So what are the greatest investments we can make for ourselves?</p><h3> 1. Health</h3><p> <br/> Not to be dark &ndash; but I&rsquo;m dying, you&rsquo;re dying, we&rsquo;re all dying, and sitting down all day isn&rsquo;t exactly fending off that destination. We&rsquo;re fools if we believe we can sacrifice our health for the sake of our business or goals.</p><p> I know, I know &ndash; you don&rsquo;t want to hear it! But you need to. I need to.</p><p> Being healthy isn&rsquo;t just being active, it also means eating right and sleeping at least 7-8 hours per night. And if we don&rsquo;t make time for it, our bodies will force us to at some point, whether by illness, burnout or mental issues.</p><p> Not taking care of ourselves always catches up. Always.</p><p> Being healthy &ndash; eating right, exercising, and sleeping all work in conjunction to make us more productive in a shorter amount of time. It gives us the ability to be alert, creative, focused and more capable of handling stress.</p><p> When I see successful people online who are overweight and unhealthy, I worry for them. They may have the speaking engagements, big deals, and their names plastered everywhere, but their hectic schedules will eventually catch up.</p><p> After being diagnosed as a celiac last year and having my plane landed is a serious way in regards to my health, I realized how much we take it for granted that we CAN work and CAN prosper. My sickness lands me in bed for days at a time with after-effects that last a week and sometimes more rendering me incapable of doing everything I need to in a day.</p><p> Talk about a wake-up call!</p><p> Don&rsquo;t take your health for granted because you never know when you won&rsquo;t have it anymore.</p><h3> 2. Walking Away</h3><p> <br/> As an agency owner, this is definitely an area I struggle with, but one I am determined to defeat.</p><p> For those of you who work at home or have the capability, you know it well &ndash; work shuts down, yet somehow you end up right back in your working chair within an hour or two.</p><p> But for your sanity and mine,  <strong>  we must master it. </strong>  We must for our clients, our progress and (yes) our health. How can we expect the physical body and mind to create on a constant basis without a break &ndash; a real break?</p><p> It reminds of a computer. My laptop normally speeds ahead and can handle massive amounts of alternating activities, open tabs online, and a full home screen. Then one day it slows wayyyyyy down, gets buggy, and starts making noises. These symptoms typically remind me it&rsquo;s been a while since I shut the laptop down and let it reboot naturally. Our bodies need the same.</p><p> About four months ago, I hit burnout. It had been over a year since the last one, so I&rsquo;d forgotten the sluggish energy level, the whitewashed brain, the dizziness and nausea &ndash; basically, just total exhaustion. I was well into day 2, cussing at myself for being a procrastinator when I realized it had been weeks since I took a full day off. Ahhh, I exclaimed to my body, this is why you&rsquo;re SO upset with me!</p><p> It took me almost two weeks to fully recover, and this time, I hope the lesson has been learned.</p><p> We need breaks, throughout the day, full days off, days to relax, to laugh, to forget about work, and to rejuvenate the creativeness that sets us on fire.</p><p> These days, I take mini breaks throughout the day, and walk away from my computer no later than 9pm. And I honor myself in taking one full day off a week.</p><h3> 3. Balance</h3><p> <br/> I call balance an enigma for entrepreneurs. We constantly hear about it, but never seen it. I think natural human tendencies are towards extremes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on a diet tomorrow so I won&rsquo;t eat ANYTHING for a week,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get this done, so I won&rsquo;t STOP until it&rsquo;s complete.&rdquo;</p><p> We jump in so full throttle that we forget that term, &lsquo;happy medium&rsquo; is really our best friend.</p><p> We have to allow ourselves to be human, have awareness for how we deal with different aspects of life, and then acclimate to make the best decisions we can for how to master them.</p><p> For myself, balancing is almost a laughable subject. I go to such extremes that my parents just shake their head when I&rsquo;ve found a new obsession or am staying away from something &ndash; they know in time all will calm down. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop my yearning for the quest of balance, and I&rsquo;m closer than ever!</p><p> We need balance to be successful &ndash; knowing when to grind it out and when to take it easy. I meet lots of successful people, but where they are successful in the working area of their life, other aspects are missing out. And sadly, it&rsquo;s usually the most important parts, i.e. oneself, family or friends.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no shame in working long hours, in putting the time in, but we won&rsquo;t ever be able to get that time back.</p><p> If something happened and it was all over tomorrow, would you be happy with the way you spent your last night/week/year? It&rsquo;s a question I often ask myself because if I don&rsquo;t, I will stay and work and let life pass by.</p><p> We can have both, but must make the investment in ourselves to make it happen.</p>",

A lot of things that are supposed to be prospecting don&rsquo;t do enough to open the new relationships or the opportunities. If something is easy, it probably isn&rsquo;t prospecting.</p><h3> Prospecting requires that you ask for the commitment of time.</h3><p> <br/> In business-to-business sales, you mostly need a face-to-face conversation. If what you are doing doesn&rsquo;t require your dream client to make that commitment, then it isn&rsquo;t likely that it is really prospecting.</p><h3> Prospecting results in you hearing the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; a fair bit.</h3><p> <br/> Because you are asking, some people will say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Some won&rsquo;t have perceived the need. Some won&rsquo;t be susceptible to your pitch or perceive the value in meeting with you. Some say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to every salesperson because they have a relationship. If what you are doing doesn&rsquo;t result in some people rejecting your ask, it probably isn&rsquo;t prospecting.</p><h3> Much of the time, prospecting feels like work.</h3><p> <br/> What comes after prospecting can feel a lot more fun. The first meeting is exciting. Presenting is even more exciting. Even the stress of fighting for a deal and coming up with a strategy is exhilarating. If what you are doing doesn&rsquo;t feel like work, if you don&rsquo;t feel any resistance to doing it, it is probably something other than prospecting.</p><h3> The outcome of your prospecting efforts is appointments.</h3><p> <br/> You make some effort, you produce some number of appointments. Appointments are what count, and they are what is counted. If what you are doing doesn&rsquo;t count, or if counting it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, it isn&rsquo;t prospecting.</p><p> Do you need your calendar open and available? If not, you are doing something other than prospecting.

    "content": "<p> We&rsquo;ve all been tempted. Whether there&rsquo;s a hot new sector that seems to be on fire, or a classic U.S. company that seems poised for a new burst of life, or, worse, a pundit who keeps warning us not to get caught flat-footed.</p><p> It&rsquo;s human nature to be attracted to the next shiny new thing. My 2-year old son was perfectly happy playing with his trusty push truck, for instance, until he got a shiny red Matchbox car for his birthday and abandoned the &ndash; still very serviceable &ndash; truck.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also human nature to try to catch winners on the way up and want to abandon the underperformers. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s always a good idea.</p><p> While the market as a whole has done quite well over the last 20 years &ndash; the S&amp;P 500 has returned approximately 9.9%, and a diversified portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds would have returned 8.7% [1]&ndash; the same can&rsquo;t be said for the average investor.</p><p> During the 10 year period from 2003- 2013, the average investor&rsquo;s portfolio only returned 2.6% annually, [2] barely a quarter of what the S&amp;P returned, and not much higher than the rate of inflation.</p><p> What&rsquo;s the reason for this underperformance?</p><p> By trying to beat the market by chasing performance, by trying to time markets, and by overpaying in fees, investors hurt their returns significantly.</p><h3> Chasing Returns</h3><p> <br/> When a particular investment is performing well, investors often get excited and invest more, causing the price to continue to climb. As it does, more investors are attracted to its returns &ndash; even as the stock becomes more expensive &ndash; causing the price to rise even more.</p><p> Eventually however the investment will return to its intrinsic value, and fluctuate slightly around that number.</p><p> When that happens, the investors who tried to chase performance and bought on the more expensive upswing, will lose money or underperform the market.</p><h3> Timing the Market</h3><p> <br/> It is not surprising that investors try to time the market. If we were able to predict when markets would top and when they would bottom, we&rsquo;d all be enjoying extraordinary returns. In reality, however, very few people who try to time the markets actually succeed.</p><p> According to Morningstar, market timing costs the average investor 1.5% annually. For a hypothetical portfolio that returned 8.7% annually, a 1.5% additional &lsquo;expense&rsquo; ends up eating up over 17% of the investor&rsquo;s returns.</p><p> Warren Buffet once said, &ldquo;the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good.&rdquo; Famed investor Peter Lynch said, &ldquo;Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves&rdquo;. [3]</p><p> If Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch don&rsquo;t believe in trying to time the market, and studies have shown that strategies that try to time the market have very low success rates, it&rsquo;s a good sign that you&rsquo;re probably better off not trying too.</p><h3> Overpaying Fees</h3><p> <br/> If you are chasing returns, and trying to time the market, chances are you are making more trades than you would with a buy-and-hold strategy. That means you are paying more fees, which also affects your overall rate of return negatively.</p><h3> A Potential Solution</h3><p> <br/> The smarter approach may be to  <strong>  do less </strong> . Investors have historically hurt their returns by over-trading. Looking at your portfolio too often or constantly checking up on how the markets are doing can be detrimental to your finances if you are prone to reacting too impulsively. Rather than trying to time the market, or always buying the next hot stock or asset class, investors tend to have more success by taking a hands off approach.</p><p> Yes, his red Matchbox car is shiny and bright. But, as my son grows up, I hope he&rsquo;ll learn to value the tried and true as well. And smart investors do the same, thinking carefully before they leap into the next big thing, or try to catch the current wave and ride it to the top.</p><p> Sometimes doing less is doing more.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theheavypurse/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Shannon Ryan  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://theheavypurse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Heavy Purse </a></p><p> Another school year is winding down and many young adults are getting ready to cross that bridge into the next chapter of their lives: college. It is an exciting and scary time for college-bound kids and their parents. There is a lot of planning that goes into making college a successful experience, especially when it comes to paying for it. Today, I&rsquo;m going to walk you through 5 steps to help both you and your child prepare for college, which begins years before they even receive their acceptance letter.</p><h3> 1. Determine Where College Savings Fits Within Your Priorities</h3><p> <br/> Many parents want to provide some financial assistance to their kids and help offset the costs of college. At the same time, I also assume you have other goals, such as retirement, buying a home, travel and so on. Be sure you review all of your goals and understand where college savings fits in.</p><p> Only you know how college savings compares to your other goals and what sacrifices you are willing or not willing to make. Do what is right for your family and aligns with your values. What is most important is that your choices don&rsquo;t sacrifice your financial stability now or in the future. There are options available to help cover the costs of college that are not available to help you fund your retirement or assist you if you overextend yourself now.</p><p> Good financial planning can also provide clarity around your priorities and help you stay on track to reach all your savings goals.</p><h3> 2. Talk about College Frequently</h3><p> <br/> College should be a topic you discuss regularly with your children, even when they are young and college seems many, many years away. You want to lay the groundwork now about college, so your kids understand that it is a privilege, not a right. My girls know there is a link between their school performance now and Mom and Dad paying for college later. I will happily invest in their future provided they demonstrate a desire to attend college and do well in school.</p><p> While it is true that a college degree or even being a hard worker doesn&rsquo;t guarantee success, I also know very few people in life who succeeded without trying. Start setting expectations early and talk to your kids frequently to make sure college is the best choice for them and their future.</p><h3> 3. Create a Parental Financial Aid Package</h3><p> <br/> Most parents spend years saving money to help pay for their child(ren)&rsquo;s college education and just sign checks when the bills come due. This is a mistake. You are making a significant investment in your children and have every right to set clear parameters around your financial assistance.</p><p> You and your spouse should prepare your parental financial aid package privately and be in full agreement when you present it to your child. Do not wait until they are applying for colleges to share it with them either. There should be no surprises as to what you will and will not cover.</p><p> I would start breaking it down for them when they enter high school, so they understand the requirements to even be eligible for your financial assistance and what they must do to maintain that support once they are in college. By setting very specific expectations with them, your kids better understand this huge financial gift you are giving them and treat it with the respect it deserves.</p><h3> 4. Be Prepared to Make Difficult Decisions</h3><p> <br/> This is a hard one. We want to give our kids lots of latitude and make their own choices. But we also need to remember that they are still kids who don&rsquo;t have the life experience to always fully understand the ramifications behind their decisions, especially when it comes to student debt. You may need to make some hard and unpopular decisions but do not shy away from making them.</p><p> By preparing and sharing your parental financial aid package, your child should already be aware of some baseline expectations. However, many kids still need some additional financial support beyond what you can provide. Most will fearlessly sign on the dotted line and later come to regret some of their decisions around their student loans. Help avoid this all too common scenario by helping them make educated decisions.</p><h3> Understand the Return On Investment</h3><p> <br/> Again, by creating a parental financial aid package, your kids should know what colleges fit your parameters, i.e. public or private and in-state or out-state colleges, etc. The price tag of a college is probably the last consideration for most kids, so you need to help it become a key consideration by calculating the Return On Investment or ROI.</p><p> Most don&rsquo;t do this and it&rsquo;s one reason why I believe there is so much student debt today. Remember, receiving financial aid is very different than getting a mortgage. Two students with very different future earning potential can receive the same amount of money from the same college. Do the math because no one else will do it for you. Is the amount of student debt too high against future earning potential? Cost should not be the sole consideration when choosing a college but it must be considered.</p><h3> Take Only What You Need</h3><p> <br/> In most instances, they may receive money above the cost of tuition and board. This may seem like a good benefit as it gives kids some breathing room and spending money. The problem is that it is not &ldquo;free&rdquo; money. Most will spend that money on the extras, from Spring Break to beer tabs to clothes and gadgets to pet iguanas. 5, 10, 15 or 20 years later, when they are still paying off their student loans, most regret using student loan money versus earning money to pay for those things.</p><p> Kids will need spending money, but they should avoid using student loan money as much as possible for those types of expenses. You also don&rsquo;t want them to turn to credit cards either as that is just a different kind of debt. Instead, they should consider part-time jobs while in school and potentially bumping it to full-time during summer. Kids won&rsquo;t innately know to do this, so you&rsquo;ll have to help them understand.</p><h3> 5. Create a Plan to Tackle Student Debt</h3><p> <br/> Many kids will need additional assistance beyond Mom and Dad to attend college. Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up over this. Instead, focus on making sure they have a plan to use that money responsibly while in school and are prepared to tackle their debt aggressively after graduation. Remember, most kids happily spend that money while in college. Once they start making monthly payments, along with the new expenses of truly being on their own, does the weight of their debt truly become real because hypothetically living with debt is easy but reality is often much harder.</p><p> Sit down with your kids and create a budget for while they are in school and later for after graduation. This will give them a clear snapshot of their expenses (non-discretionary money) and what discretionary money they have available. Talk about their short-term and long-term goals too. They certainly have dreams they want to achieve and by creating a plan, they can make value-based decisions on how to spend their money as they pay down their student debt.</p><h3> A New Chapter Begins</h3><p> <br/> College is an exciting time. I have many cherished memories from my time in college as I&rsquo;m sure you do too. I want my girls to have a wonderful experience, which also means making smart choices before, during and after college. Otherwise, those memories may lose a bit of shine when weighed down by debt and regret. This can be avoided by having regular conversations with your kids about college and playing an active role as they make choices to start the next chapter of their lives.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Does reading your bio make you feel confident, happy, excited to be you? (Can I have a &ldquo;yeah, baby&rdquo;?)</p><p> c</p><h3> Can we talk makeover?</h3><p> <br/> Sure, you can hire yourself a bio writer (there are clear advantages to getting a fresh perspective), but maybe you want to take a stab at it yourself first. To get clear on EXACTLY what will sear you into the collective memory of your sweet-spot audience. Try simmering on four questions.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the singular purpose of your bio?</h3><p> <br/> You have to pick one thing you want your bio to do over all others. Get yourself hired? Sell your books/products? Score media attention?</p><p> You&rsquo;ll most likely need at least three to five bios: a full story for your website, a modified version for LinkedIn, a short snappy Twitter-length bio (which can often do multiple duty for Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and/or Google+), a slight variation for Facebook and a full media bio.</p><p> If you create content for other websites, you&rsquo;ll need additional bio versions that fit with their requirements, but still showcase your talents. (Tip: keep a master list of all your bios so you can update them quickly when needed.)</p><h3> Who&rsquo;s your audience?</h3><p> <br/> Who are you most writing for? Have you created  <a href=\"http://www.rochellemoulton.com/developing-your-client-avatar/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a client avatar or two? </a>  If you haven&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s time to get exquisitely clear on your sweet-spot clients, buyers or audience. Who are they, what do they care about? What&rsquo;s their biggest source of pain? What are their greatest opportunities and fondest hopes and dreams? How does their future life change when they experience you or your work?</p><p> It may be tempting to skip this step, but don&rsquo;t. These are the people you do your best work for. Spend serious time really understanding their motivations and needs. Only then can you speak to them and start to pull them into your circle, your tribe.</p><h3> First person or third?</h3><p> <br/> Experts tend to gravitate to writing their bios in the third person. It feels more comfortable. A bit loftier perhaps. The problem is, third person bios create distance between you and the reader. Speaking directly to your sweet-spot audience&mdash;first person&mdash;requires you to own what you&rsquo;re saying about yourself. There is no hiding behind superlatives.</p><p> And you&rsquo;re much more apt to tell your story narrative-style, which is all we really want to know anyway.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s your story?</h3><p> <br/> Every great story has five elements: setting, characters, plot, theme and conflict. And so does yours. You are the central character of course, but how did your setting influence your career, your life? Did you grow up on a farm or the big city? Stay where you were raised or go adventuring?</p><p> Your plot is always unfolding. By showing your audience how you got here and where you&rsquo;re going, you&rsquo;re giving them a plot line to follow. To decide if they want to hop on with you and see where the story takes you, together.</p><p> Your theme is the current that runs throughout your entire story. Maybe you live to champion the underdog or you&rsquo;re a dyed-in-the-wool entrepreneur. Your theme may be a logical &ldquo;well of course&rdquo; or a challenging &ldquo;aha&rdquo; you have to search for&mdash;at its best, it ties together your life and your work.</p><p> But what most experts tend to neglect&mdash;because we&rsquo;re so busy proving how smart we are&mdash;is CONFLICT. Every great story needs it or you&rsquo;re just a &ldquo;meh&rdquo;. When were you down, defeated, beaten even? How did you overcome the odds? What reserves did you tap into that bring you to where you are right here, right now?</p><p> Oh, and don&rsquo;t waste precious time being embarrassed about your failures&mdash;we all have them. Embrace them. They give your story (and your bio) heart. Remember, we like routing for the underdog and helping him win.</p><p> Ask yourself these four questions over and over again. Take notes and let them simmer for a while. Then start writing ( <a href=\"http://www.rochellemoulton.com/discover-your-copywriting-mojo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here are a few copywriting tips </a> ). Leave it and come back to it. It may take several&mdash;or 10+&mdash;iterations to whip it into shape. But don&rsquo;t give up.</p><p> Dedicate the care and attention it needs to gel and become, well, unforgettable. Because your story deserves to not only be read, but to be part of the glue that binds you to your very best tribe.</p>",

    "title": "South Korea: Government Knows Best?",
    "link": "south-korea-government-knows-best",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  Siddharth Bhargava | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatthewsAsia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Matthews Asia  </u> </a></p><p> On a trip to South Korea earlier this year, I felt somewhat frustrated by a recurring sentiment I heard among banks, telecommunications firms and cable providers; when pressed on the subject of profitability, representatives would often offer an apologetic shrug and some comment to indicate that &ldquo;Well, the government sees this as a public utility...so there is only so much we can do.&rdquo; While one may expect stringent regulation in the banking segment, I was surprised to hear this sentiment echoed in other sectors as well. </p><h3> One needs to examine history to understand the root of this interventionist policy.</h3><p> <br/> Less than 70 years ago, South Korea was an impoverished nation when Syngman Rhee became its first president. Because of Japan&rsquo;s occupation of the country, all meaningful assets were state-owned, and decision-making was concentrated with a select few officials. Assets were sold off to influential individuals at substantial discounts, and this was the genesis of Korea&rsquo;s model for chaebol, large, often family owned conglomerates. When General Park Chung Hee took power in a coup in the 1960s, economic development became a top priority for the administration and chaebol firms were the preferred vehicles of economic growth. The dark side of this government-directed capital allocation was the unequal distribution of power, with workers paying the price. </p><h3> Because of the historic dominance of large corporations in Korea,</h3><p> <br/> as well as the government&rsquo;s proclivity for making labor laws subservient to these corporations, political and social forces are seeking to right these wrongs. Government influence can be felt through regulators and the state-owned policy bank to clamp down on rent-seeking behavior by companies at the expense of domestic consumers. However, policy has often proven to be self-defeating. For instance, the bank regulator provides aggressive guidance on how loan prices should be decreased depending on their assessment of the fairness of price, rather than a fair return on capital. Labor laws seek to protect the rights of unions and provide equitable distribution of wealth. Rigid labor laws have led the country to have among the world&rsquo;s highest rates of temporary employment. Fundamental reform is subject to political machinations. While President Park Geun Hye has put the labor market at the core of structural reforms, tens of thousands of workers recently went on strike to protest against reforms. Such laws have hurt global competitiveness and caused chaebol to invest outside the country and in people-light, portable, competitive advantages. <br/> <br/> While government influence is still felt in utility-type businesses, these firms stand in stark contrast to some truly globally competitive Korean firms. For instance, food producers and cosmetic companies have been headed by domestic entrepreneurs and evolved under the influence of market feedback mechanisms and competition. These industries have exported quality products to China, winning market share and brand recognition there. Then there are manufacturing firms that have benefited from the Korean government&rsquo;s strict adherence to export discipline early on, combined with a willingness to cull underperforming firms. Korean auto manufacturers, for example, were given preferential treatment in the form of subsidies and better foreign exchange terms. Those who failed to live up to the government&rsquo;s export standards found themselves short of foreign exchange to import raw material, working capital loans and, ultimately, were allowed to fail. So while there has been broad-based government influence in the Korean economy, it has been to protect domestic consumers while exerting enormous pressure on firms to be globally competitive. While industries subject to populist policies have destroyed capital, it&rsquo;s the latter group of export-led companies that provide ample ground for us to find outstanding investments.  <br/> <br/> Further, there are attempts to improve corporate governance and regulation. Matthews Asia earlier highlighted a slew of reforms in an  <u>  <a href=\"http://matthewsasia.com/perspectives-on-asia/asia-weekly/article-784/default.fs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   August 2014 Weekly Asia commentary  </a> </u> . Since then, conglomerates have announced measures to merge units, simplify corporate structures and ultimately improve governance. Progress continues on measures such as a reduction in taxes levied on dividend income for shareholders, deterring corporates from hoarding cash, and a re-emphasis on more domestically focused companies, rather than cyclical, trade-driven ones. With presidential elections slated for 2016, we look for consistency in policy to ensure these reforms continue unabated.</p>",

It erodes over time, gradually disintegrating with every &ldquo;I Told You So&rdquo; moment that you give to your critics. </strong></p><p> You know the &ldquo;I Told You So&rsquo;s&rdquo; I&rsquo;m talking about, right? Those foaming-at-the-mouth haters lying in wait for any shard of proof that can be tweeted, snapped, posted and shouted to their network, &ldquo;See, I'm not just being a  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra\" target=\"_blank\">   Cassandra  </a> </u> ... this (insert brand) really is the evil (expletive) that I've been warning you about&hellip; and here&rsquo;s the proof!&rdquo;</p><p> We all have them in our networks &ndash; they despise Apple, or Microsoft, or Facebook, or Starbucks, or (insert brand)&hellip; They&rsquo;re loud and they&rsquo;re insistent and the righteousness of their certainty tweaks doubt with each successive rant. It&rsquo;s like death by a thousand paper cuts &ndash; with each new complaint, each &ldquo;I Told You So&rdquo;, eroding our own confidence in our brand loyalties.</p><p> <strong>  Arming fans to defend their loyalty to you in the face of your critics' assaults must be integral to any successful brand strategy. </strong></p><p> Haters are like schoolyard bullies. They don&rsquo;t really need the milk money. What they want is for everyone to bend to their will. For them, it&rsquo;s about reinforcing their power at the expense of everyone else&rsquo;s. When your critics launch an &ldquo;I Told You So&rdquo; tirade, and aim it at your customer, they&rsquo;re not just &ldquo;sharing their opinions&rdquo;. They're needing to prove that they&rsquo;re right... at your, and your fans', expense.</p><p> And, make no mistake. Your fans know they're under attack. And they probably want to resist, to defend themselves. The question is - do they have the ammunition they need to do so? Do they have, not just the narratives, but the truths, that can and will mute the corrosive influence of the \"I Told You So?\" In short, has your Brand enabled your fans and customers to be able to defend themselves? Because, the hard reality is, only you and your Brand can do that. </p><p> <strong>  When it comes to brand loyalty, there&rsquo;s only one thing that can help fans defend themselves against insults by critics. And that&rsquo;s the brand being defended. </strong></p><p> Unfortunately, too many marketers don&rsquo;t think about Brand this way. Yes, Brand is about getting new customers into the funnel. And, absolutely, it&rsquo;s about keeping existing customers in the tribe. But essential to the long-term success of every Brand Strategy, to the very survival of every company, is the empowering of fans with the weapons they need to protect brands with a collective defense. Why? So that the creeping doubt that&rsquo;s so corrosive to loyalty is held in check.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;m talking Deflate-gate &hellip; It&rsquo;s been all over the news since the start of 2015. The New England Patriots let air out of the footballs used in their playoff, making the ball easier to catch and hold onto, which likely influenced the outcome of those games.</p><p> Once the season ended, the NFL launched an investigation into the allegations. Last week, they released their findings and sanctions against the New England Patriots. The Patriots franchise QB was suspended for the first 4 games of the season and the organization was fined $1,000,000 &hellip;. Whoop-dee-doo!!</p><h3> The NFL got it wrong.</h3><p> <br/> And we should pay close attention so we don&rsquo;t repeat the same mistakes in our own organizations.</p><h3> The NFL gave more harsh punishment for off-the-field conduct than on-the-field. </h3><p> <br/> Remember Michael Vick? Ray Rice?  The NFL acted swiftly and dropped a loud, heavy hammer on them for their off-the-field issues. I agreed with and supported the quick reaction and the decisions. However, if they&rsquo;re going to go hard for conduct outside of work, they should go hard-ER for lapses of integrity at work &hellip; As leaders in our organizations, we should make better choices. If we&rsquo;re going to monitor and discipline personal conduct outside the office, we must be prepared to hold the standard even higher for conduct inside the office.</p><h3> The NFL treated minority players differently. <strong>    </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m not going to get into racial conspiracy theories on why &mdash; but there&rsquo;s no denying that Tom Brady is white and the other players mentioned are not. Perhaps the NFL didn&rsquo;t consider this in making their decision. Perhaps, in today&rsquo;s racial climate, they should have &hellip; As leaders in our organizations, we have to be mindful of disparate treatment and impact in our employment decisions. We have to make sure our decisions are thoughtful and can withstand legal scrutiny if challenged.</p><h3> The NFL didn&rsquo;t send a consistent message. </h3><p> <br/> Back in 2012, the New Orleans Saints were exposed for giving bonuses to players for causing injuries to opponents with hard hits. Labeled &ldquo;Bounty-gate&rdquo;, the investigation resulted in indefinite suspensions for coaches, players and front office staff as well as loss of draft picks, record-setting financial sanctions and a required certification program against bounty programs. The NFL commissioner spoke out publicly against the practice of bounty hitting to deliberately injure other players. I agreed with and supported this, too. However, the same level of outrage seemed to be missing in this instance. And it is difficult to understand why &hellip; As leaders in our organizations, we have to be equally outraged for all flagrant violations of our standards of conduct. We must also be consistent with our punishments for egregious infractions.</p><h3> The NFL issued a punishment that won&rsquo;t really hurt the offenders or deter others. </h3><p> <br/> Losing the QB for games against team who aren&rsquo;t contenders for anything but the top pick in next year&rsquo;s draft doesn&rsquo;t hurt the team or the QB&rsquo;s bank account. The organizational fine will be paid for without batting an eye &mdash; in fact, fans have already started a GoFundMe campaign to help the team pay the money. Most were expecting sweeping suspensions, crippling fines and stripped titles &mdash; instead, we got the equivalent of a hand spank on a two-year-old &hellip; As leaders in our organizations, we have to send clear messages about expected and acceptable behavior. We should not miss the opportunity to use discipline as an example for others not to follow.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not one to rank one thing as being more horrible than another. I believe you can be outraged equally about more than one thing at a time. In my world, cheating and lying about it are just as outrageous as causing safety risk to other employees and being arrested for a violent crime &hellip; Not so much the case if I worked for the NFL.</p><p> Make sure the decisions you make about employee behavior and conduct are really sending the messages you want to send to your managers, employees, vendors and customers about the kind of business you run and the kind of people you will associate with. At some point, this might mean taking harsh disciplinary action against one of the most popular, high-performing, well-known, revered people in the organization.</p><p> <strong>  When that moment comes, don&rsquo;t punk out. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Earlier this year, the folks at Acrolinx decided to &ldquo;read and evaluate the world&rsquo;s content.&rdquo; Sound like a daunting task? It was. They reviewed 150,000 websites from 340 companies, and the results were enlightening.</p><p> The study found that, despite content marketing being a top priority for today&rsquo;s businesses, only 42% of B2B and 34% of B2C marketers felt their content was effective. Part of the problem is that 70% of marketers say they don&rsquo;t have a solid content marketing strategy. But an even larger issue is a surprising lack of quality (Source:  <u>  The Global Content Impact Index </u> ).</p><p> 42% of B2B and 34% of B2C marketers felt their content was effective &hellip; 70% of marketers say they don&rsquo;t have a solid content marketing strategy.</p><h3> Forget about quantity</h3><p> <br/> According to Acrolinx, many marketers are still too focused on quantity, thinking that if they put out enough content their message will simply &ldquo;get out there.&rdquo; It might, but it won&rsquo;t make an impact over the longer term.</p><p> It can even lose a company some of its customers. A survey from Global Lingo found that 74% of people pay attention to the quality of spelling and grammar on a company&rsquo;s website. And 59% of those people said bad grammar and spelling would make them take their business elsewhere, because they&rsquo;d be worried about the company&rsquo;s attention to detail and quality of service.</p><p> And still there&rsquo;s more. Search engines like Google and Bing are known to downgrade websites full of errors. That&rsquo;s bound to have an impact on a company&rsquo;s bottom line.</p><h3> Improve quality and clarity</h3><p> <br/> Acrolinx rightly points out that there&rsquo;s more to producing high-quality content than good grammar and proper spelling. To make the most impact, you&rsquo;ll need a clear message, engaging style and conversational tone.</p><p> This is exactly the type of content marketing quality Acrolinx set out to analyze. The company evaluated content from 340 companies from a range of industries and across all regions. Content was scored based on quality and clarity.</p><p> Quality was evaluated using established best practices for grammar and style. Clarity was judged by how easy the content is to read and understand. Next, each company was given an overall content impact score out of 100. A score of 72 or higher means the content is effective.</p><p> The results? Only 31% of companies had a content impact score of 72 or higher, which was fairly consistent across industries and regions.</p><h3> Quick tips</h3><p> <br/> It seems many content marketers haven&rsquo;t quite got the right message yet. So what can each of us do to make more of an impact?</p><li> Put a consistent and cohesive content marketing strategy in place.</li><li> Hire people who know about grammar, spelling and style. Acrolinx looked at things like subject-verb agreement, use of double negatives and other points of style found in any major style guide. These are basics that your lead content writers and editors should firmly grasp.</li><li> Keep your message easy to read and understand. Acrolinx suggests keeping an eye on things like sentence length, structural complexity and word length. Scroll to the end of their study for some examples of high-quality content that&rsquo;s both inviting and engaging.</li>",

Rowling&rsquo;s book called &ldquo;Very Good Lives&rdquo;  </a> </u>  and it touched me in an incredibly powerful way; I hope you&rsquo;ll take time to consider reading this book.  So much of what she writes about in this 2008 commencement address to a group of Harvard graduates resonates on many levels of what I&rsquo;m working on in social media:  there are benefits to failing and growing our imagination.</p><h3> Like most financial advisors I know, our community of professionals are not hip to failing.  </h3><p> <br/> When you handle another human being&rsquo;s future through financial means, failing is pretty much not an option.  Our job is take theoretical planning and make it become a reality for those who invested their time, trust and money into our expertise.  That&rsquo;s an enormous amount of responsibility.</p><p> As J.K. Rowling shares in this book, &ldquo;Ultimately we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is eager to give you a set of criteria, if you let it&rdquo; could not be more true of how financial advisors live every day through their planning practices.  It&rsquo;s even applies to me in providing social media assistance to advisors.</p><p> My goal is to give advisors enough of a foreshadow into what works and doesn&rsquo;t work with social media in their practice, but ultimately the advisor must decide what they feel was their failure; I can&rsquo;t do that part for them.  At the same time, my job is to provide imaginative ways to disrupt the common day person&rsquo;s way of seeing our community.  It&rsquo;s all about the balance between the two.</p><p> This book is a quick read (I read it in less than 30 minutes) and when I came upon this sentence:</p><p> &ldquo;We do not need magic to transform our world; we carry all the power we need inside ourselves:  we have the power to imagine better.&rdquo;</p><h3> I knew she was talking to all of us in financial services.  </h3><p> <br/> Are you experiencing a very good life?  What are you uniquely doing to transform your world?  Are you working to imagine things in a better way?  Ask yourselves these questions and do the work to make them statements of affirmation.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC!</p>",

Delta announced a 50-percent dividend raise and $5-billion  stock buyback program.\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-05-15/COMM-delta-plane.jpg\"/></p><h3> Dividend Growth at 15 Percent</h3><p> <br/> With a little over 90 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported, average first-quarter earnings for the index rose a modest 2 percent. That might not seem significant, but as LP Financial&rsquo;s Chief Investment Officer Burt White points out in a recent Barron&rsquo;s piece, &ldquo;given the steep uphill climb that corporate America faced due to the twin drags of the oil downturn and strong U.S. dollar, this is actually a good result.&rdquo;</p><p> Indeed, when the earnings season began, economists were expecting to see a 3-percent drop because of depressed oil and the strong dollar. Of course, we&rsquo;re now seeing a price reversal in both the commodity and currency.</p><p> Dividends from S&amp;P 500 companies also rose, jumping about 15 percent in the first quarter, defying lackluster estimates. Delta Air Lines, also in MEGAX, announced this week that it would be raising its dividend 50 percent as well as buying back $5 billion in stock over the next couple of years.</p><p> What&rsquo;s important for investors to recognize here is that the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield is currently at 1.92 percent, ahead of the 1.50-percent yield on a 5-year government bond. And unlike the government bonds, equities give you potential growth. It&rsquo;s these high dividend-paying companies that GBTFX and MEGAX seek to invest in.</p><h3> Investors Shrug Off Weak Economic News</h3><p> <br/> The week&rsquo;s economic data suggests that the U.S. economy is growing at a slower rate now than in previous months.</p><p> According to the U.S. Census Bureau, retail and food service sales in April were little changed from March. Inventories are steadily creeping up.</p><p> On Friday, economists trimmed their forecast for the rate of jobs growth this year from 3.2 percent to 2.4 percent. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan consumer confidence index fell pretty dramatically from 95.9 in April to 88.6 in May.   </p><p> This soft economic news appears not to have dampened investors&rsquo; spirits too much, however, as it means the Fed will be more likely to keep rates low for at least the short-term.</p><p> You can see that the M1 money supply, the most liquid form of capital, began to ramp up with the first round of quantitative easing (QE) in late 2008, pulling the S&amp;P 500 up with it. We called the bottom of the market in an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/finding-more-promising-signs-of-a-turnaround/#.VVZwef50zct\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Investor Alert  </a> </u>  from December 2008.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-05-15/COMM-Follow-the-Money-Quantitative-Easing-and-the-SP-500-Index_05152015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" Quantitative Easing and the S&amp;P 500 Index\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-05-15/COMM-Follow-the-Money-Quantitative-Easing-and-the-SP-500-Index_05152015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> After three cycles, QE officially wrapped up last October, but money continues to flow into the market, lifting all boats.</p><p> Lately, investors have been moving more of their money out of domestic equity funds and into internationally-focused funds, especially those focused on Europe, according to a Credit Suisse report. This is in line with the results of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/show-me-the-stocks-not-the-cash-say-optimistic-ceos/#.VVY-nv50xFo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bloomberg survey  </a> </u>  I shared earlier in the month which shows that global investors are most bullish on the eurozone than any other region, a good sign for our  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/emerging-europe-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Emerging Europe Fund (EUROX)  </u>  . </a></p><h3> Significant Inverse Relationship Between the U.S. Dollar and Gold/Oil</h3><p> <br/> The U.S. dollar lost more ground for the fifth straight week, falling to its lowest level since January. This has allowed crude oil to begin its recovery&mdash;it&rsquo;s currently trading just below $60 per barrel&mdash;while gold marks time in the $1,200 range.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-05-15/COMM-Year-Over-Year-Percent-Change-Oscillator-USDollar-vs-Oil-Prices-and-Gold-Prices-05152015-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" U.S. Dollar vs. Oil Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-05-15/COMM-Year-Over-Year-Percent-Change-Oscillator-USDollar-vs-Oil-Prices-and-Gold-Prices-05152015.gif\"/> </a></p><p> As you can see, the dollar reverted back to its mean after rising to close to three standard deviations as recently as mid-March. There&rsquo;s plenty of momentum for the dollar to drop even further, which should help oil&rsquo;s recovery.</p><p> Gold remains in a three-year bear market. In an interview with Jim Puplava on the  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/wrestling-with-something-else-why-this-gold-bear-market-is-different/#.VVZOZP50xFo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Financial Sense Newshour  </u>  , </a>  I explained that the domestic equity bull market has lately overshadowed the yellow metal as an asset class, but that when gold&rsquo;s down, as it is now, it might be time to put money in gold and gold stocks.</p><p> This week we expect to see preliminary purchasing manager&rsquo;s index (PMI) numbers for not only the U.S. and Europe but also China. Perhaps we'll see if the U.S. economy has really softened or if it&rsquo;s simply taking a breather after months of steady growth.</p><p> Happy investing!</p>",

    "content": "<p> In the past few weeks there has been a consistent theme surfacing with my clients that had me thinking about  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia\" target=\"_blank\">   Jerry Garcia  </a> </u>  and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead\" target=\"_blank\">   Grateful Dead  </a> </u> .  (I realize that as an estate planner, talking about a band called &ldquo;Grateful Dead&rdquo; might sound odd, or perhaps even disturbing, but I digress.) Many of my clients are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   beneficiaries  </a> </u>  in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wills  </a> </u>  who are dealing with incompetent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   executors  </a> </u> . As a firm who handles estate administration cases, there is nothing worse than an incompetent executor, and nothing better than a great executor. Which leads to us Jerry.</p><h3> In 1995, Jerry Garcia died of a heart attack at 53 years old. </h3><p> <br/> Jerry&rsquo;s estate was worth a little under $7 million, which does not include royalties for his music and other passions (yes, I&rsquo;m referring to the ice cream flavor  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.benjerry.com/flavors/cherry-garcia-ice-cream\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cherry Garcia  </a> </u> !).</p><p> Jerry&rsquo;s last will appointed his third wife Deborah as co-executrix of his estate.  Deborah was also a 1/3 beneficiary of his estate (which is common under many states&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/elective_share\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   elective share laws  </u> </a> ). Garcia also included support for his second wife, Carolyn, and child support for his daughter Keelin.</p><p> Deborah decided to cut off alimony payments to Carolyn, and so Carolyn sued Deborah for breaching her  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fiduciary duty  </a> </u>  as executrix of Jerry&rsquo;s estate. Carolyn eventually won in court, but she had to settle for much less than her judgment because she wanted to end the case quickly and avoid being locked in court for many years to come.</p><p> <strong>  The point of this story, and the stories of my clients, is that choosing your executor is not something that should be taken lightly. </strong>   Do not just choose someone because they are your oldest child, or because you are too lazy to think of anyone else. Choose someone responsible, trustworthy, someone who will get it right.  It&rsquo;s usually wiser to choose someone who is trustworthy and honest even if you think you might insult one of your children.</p><p> Calmly explain in a &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/letter-of-instruction.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   letter of instruction  </a> </u> &rdquo; that you love your children, but you thought this other person or institution was the right choice for your estate.  They might be angry in the short run, but when your estate is settled amicably, and everyone receives his or her fair share, you&rsquo;ll cause less strife in the long run.  And, most importantly, your children will remember you as someone who promoted peace in all stages of life.</p>",

Don&rsquo;t piss down my back and tell me it&rsquo;s raining.\" <br/> &ndash; &ldquo;The Outlaw Josey Wales&rdquo; (1976)</p><h3> My father was a doctor who spent his entire career in a small hospital built by the Tennessee Coal and Iron company in Fairfield, Alabama.</h3><p> <br/> He was an ER doc way before emergency medicine was its own thing, which meant that he saw a wide gamut of cases, from knife fights to car wrecks to heart attacks. But it also meant that he saw a lot of ordinary colds and various infectious diseases, as the emergency clinic then &ndash; as now &ndash; was the only on-demand medical facility available for people who couldn&rsquo;t afford or didn&rsquo;t have access to private physician practices. Now one of my father&rsquo;s great joys in life was watching sports on our grainy black and white TV, miraculously upgraded to a grainy color TV when I was 12. I&rsquo;m sure he spent hundreds, if not thousands, of happy hours watching sports. Unless, of course, the hapless TV commentator made the mistake of excusing the absence of, say, Larry Bird from a Celtics game by saying that Bird &ldquo;had a touch of the flu&rdquo; and so was too sick to play, which was guaranteed to send my father into a 10-minute tirade.</p><p> &ldquo;A touch of the flu? A touch of the flu? You mean he has contracted the influenza virus? Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea what it means to have the flu? Do you have any idea how sick you are if you have the flu? People DIE from the flu, you moron! What does that even mean &hellip; a touch of the flu? Is Larry Bird in the hospital? Because if he has influenza, you sure better get him to the hospital! I hope you&rsquo;ve got a saline IV hooked up to Larry Bird&rsquo;s arm right now! No, he&rsquo;s not in the hospital. Do you know why? Because he has a COLD. That&rsquo;s right, you idiot, he has a COLD! Not the flu!&rdquo;</p><p> Honest to god, this would go on for quite a while. Somehow it never got old to my father to rail at what he perceived as the mendacity &ndash; to use a good Tennessee Williams word &ndash; of a TV commentator elevating Larry Bird&rsquo;s status from an ordinary human wrestling with a common cold to a heroic struggle with influenza. Even today, 30 years later, I can&rsquo;t help but laugh at these memories of my father whenever I read or hear about a player out for the game because of &ldquo;flu-like symptoms.&rdquo;</p><p> I&rsquo;ve inherited a lot of my father&rsquo;s traits, and one of them is his intolerance for this mendacity of language, this intentional failure to call things by their proper names, this linguistic exercise in self-puffery and cover-up. Unfortunately for me and anyone else who shares this peculiar sensitivity, mendacity of language has never been more rampant in all of our social worlds, from sports to politics to markets.</p><p> With the advent of always-on mass media that projects <u>  <a href=\"http://www.salientpartners.com/epsilontheory/post/2014/10/30/Wherefore-Art-Thou-Marcus-Welby\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the illusion of a one-to-one personal connection with cartoons like &ldquo;Tom Brady&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jim Cramer&rdquo;  </a> </u> &ndash; corporate entities that are connected with but distinct from human beings like Tom Brady and Jim Cramer &ndash; language intentionally designed to influence rather than inform is now ubiquitous in the business of sports and politics and markets Why? Because it works. It delays sanctions until after you play in the Super Bowl, until after you sign a quarter of a billion dollar contract. It deflects attention until after your term in office is over, until after you cash in with a book deal and hedge fund consultancy.</p><p> To use the ponderous, legally parsed language of the NFL&rsquo;s Wells Report on &ldquo;deflate-gate&rdquo;, language which I think wonderfully encapsulates the pinched spirit of our age, here are four things that I believe are &ldquo;more probable than not&rdquo;:</p><p> <strong>  1)      Alex Rodriguez has routinely used steroids and PED&rsquo;s of various stripes since he was a sophomore in high school. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2)      Tom Brady has routinely bribed equipment managers with autographed jerseys and new shoes in order to receive footballs deflated well below what he knew was the legal limit. </strong></p><p> <strong>  3)      Janet Yellen has routinely leaked market-moving information to favored private sector conduits, and has also sought to quash internal investigations of same. </strong></p><p> <strong>  4)      Ben Bernanke is for sale to the highest bidder.  </strong></p><h3> But here&rsquo;s the thing. I&rsquo;m not that worked up about ANY of these issues.</h3><p> <br/> Yes, A-Rod has been juicing for 25 years, and Tom Terrific breaks the rules he thinks he can get away with breaking. Okay. Them and about 5,000 other professional athletes. Janet Yellen, the prime author of Fed &ldquo;communication policy&rdquo; (the intentional use of words to influence market expectations), leaks her viewpoint as part of that communication policy and then tries to kill an internal investigation. Okay. Her and every other senior politician and bureaucrat in the history of human civilization. As for Bernanke &hellip; a former President of the United States and the leading candidate to be the next President of the United States have personally received more than $100 million in &ldquo;donations&rdquo; from mega-corporations and foreign governments, and I&rsquo;m supposed to be outraged about Ben Bernanke cashing a big check from Ken Griffin?</p><h3> What I AM worked up about, though, is the mendacity &hellip;</h3><p> <br/> the utter lack of character and authenticity &hellip; on full display in ALL of these cases. All of these cases and so many, many more.</p><p> You want to go work for Citadel? Fine, go work for Citadel. But OWN IT. Don&rsquo;t insult my &hellip; I&rsquo;m not even going to say intelligence, because it&rsquo;s not an assault on intelligence we&rsquo;re talking about here &hellip; don&rsquo;t insult my 50 years of life as a reasonably self-aware human being by claiming that you&rsquo;re taking the high road here by working for Citadel instead of, say, JP Morgan. I mean, the notion that access to the Fed&rsquo;s regulatory authority over big banks is somehow the defining characteristic of why Ben Bernanke is a sought-after commodity, or that any public outrage here is clearly misplaced because, after all, he won&rsquo;t be a &ndash; gasp! &ndash; bank lobbyist, per se &hellip; it&rsquo;s all just horrifically insulting to anyone with the common sense to know that the sky is blue, that 2 + 2 = 4, and that you don&rsquo;t meaningfully change the air pressure in footballs by rubbing them vigorously. It&rsquo;s mendacity and inauthenticity in the first degree.</p><p> You want to embark on a conscious policy of manipulating market expectations (yes, manipulating is a strong word, but it&rsquo;s exactly accurate) by planting a carefully constructed Narrative with journalists like Jon Hilsenrath at the Wall Street Journal and consultants like Regina Schleiger at Medley, journalists and consultants who you know will be influential precisely because they are trumpeting their exclusive access to you? Fine. I totally get it. Once you&rsquo;ve hit zero on short rates and pushed your balance sheet up over $4 trillion in LSAP&rsquo;s, jawboning is the only bullet you&rsquo;ve got left in the gun. But OWN IT. Don&rsquo;t tell me that you&rsquo;re meeting with Regina Schleiger at Medley because you want to hear HER perspectives on monetary policy! I&rsquo;m sure that Ms. Schleiger is a very smart person. I&rsquo;m sure that she is an insightful observer of the international economic scene. But &ndash; and I&rsquo;m trying to say this in the kindest possible way &ndash; there&rsquo;s not 1 in 100,000 investors who even knows who Ms. Schleiger is, and fewer still who would be willing to pay money or time to hear her personal opinion about the proper course of monetary policy. The exception, we are told, is the Chair of the Federal Reserve, in many respects the most powerful person on the planet &hellip; she, of course, is terribly keen to hear Ms. Schleiger&rsquo;s views on international economics.</p><p> And yes, I know that Fed governors have these consultant meetings all the time. I know that their guests do most of the talking. But I also know, because I&rsquo;ve done it, that professional investors and allocators are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to consultants like Medley, solely to glean a scrap of insight as to what the Fed is thinking, solely to be a willing host of the Narrative virus that the Fed is trying to spread. More to the point, Janet Yellen knows it, too, which is why she has these meetings. The act itself is not a horrible thing ... not for A-Rod, not for Brady, not for Yellen, and not for Bernanke. It&rsquo;s not a crime, or at least not a crime that will shame your children or your fan base. Certainly it&rsquo;s a difficult and unpleasant thing when you&rsquo;re revealed, because now you&rsquo;ve got to deal with the Roger Goodell&rsquo;s and the Bud Selig&rsquo;s and the Jeb Hensarling&rsquo;s and the Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s of the world &ndash; petty tyrants, all &ndash; but you knew there was this chance when you made the decision to break the rules, (or the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; in Bernanke&rsquo;s and 2009 A-Rod&rsquo;s case). But don&rsquo;t turn a difficult situation into a personal capitulation to mendacity. Far better to own it. </p><h3> Believe it or not, I&rsquo;m not just venting my spleen at the outrageous displays of mendacity that assault us at every turn.</h3><p> <br/> I think that there&rsquo;s an enormous political opportunity today (and I mean political in the broadest sense of the word, a sense that clearly includes the Fed, and arguably includes the NFL and MLB) to embrace authenticity, even if you are authentically an unlikable or &ndash; to use the insult du jour &ndash; a &ldquo;polarizing&rdquo; person. Not only am I convinced that we are each more likely to be successful in our chosen field when acting authentically (don&rsquo;t you think that if Tiger Woods had embraced his authentically heel-ish nature in 2009, grown a goatee and moved to a casino suite in Vegas, that he&rsquo;d still be winning majors today?), but also specifically within the chosen field of politics I think <u>  <a href=\"http://www.salientpartners.com/epsilontheory/post/2014/08/05/Fear-and-Loathing-on-the-Marketing-Trail-2014\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   there is such a hunger for authenticity that ANY display of honest conviction when confronted with adversity, even if the adversity is well-deserved for breaking a rule, quickly becomes an enormous asset  </a> </u> . Maybe this will turn out to be a more interesting election in 2016 than we think. Then again, with the vast campaign coffers already accumulated by Clinton&trade; and Bush&trade;, two profoundly inauthentic corporate entities, maybe not.  </p><p> Sigh. I know I&rsquo;m not going to change anything by writing about this stuff, any more than my father was going to change a sports commentator&rsquo;s patter by yelling at the TV. Like my father, though, I just can&rsquo;t help myself. It&rsquo;s never easy to be authentic. It&rsquo;s never easy to call things by their proper names. It&rsquo;s never easy to own it. But here in the Golden Age of the Central Banker, it&rsquo;s never been more important. Or more politically savvy.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> First quarter U.S. GDP growth disappointed analysts, though corporations, excluding the energy sector, bucked the naysayers.</h3><p> <br/> In late April, we learned the U.S. economy expanded 0.2% (real quarter-over-quarter annualized) and corporations&rsquo; top lines grew 2.2% (excluding the energy sector, which is being dragged down by lower oil prices). As of this writing, roughly 85% of corporations have provided first quarter 2015 earnings, and not since 2012 has earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) expanded by greater than the 5% reported in Q1. This is an indicator of U.S. corporate resilience, especially considering the increased value of the dollar. However, corporations levered up in the first quarter of 2015. Driven by the desire to continue returning capital to shareholders (via share repurchases and dividend increases), and in order to take advantage of low borrowing costs, corporations exceeded issuance in the first quarter of 2014, reaching $500 billion. It took until mid-June of 2014 for corporations to issue that much debt, a one-month difference. 2014, however, was already a record year for issuance.</p><p> In total, corporations issued $1 trillion of debt, and it appears that in 2015 a new record will be set. JP Morgan&rsquo;s credit research group notes that profit margins and interest coverage, both of which are key inputs in assessing credit quality, continued to be strong for companies having already reported. All things considered, we are not bothered too much by additional leverage (indeed, it&rsquo;s much harder to grow earnings than it is to issue debt), and are encouraged by solidifying fundamentals outside of the oil sector. We expect borrowing rates for corporations (&ldquo;corporate spreads&rdquo;) to decline slightly once the Federal Reserve increases its policy rate and the pace of corporate bond issuance slows down a bit.</p>Sources: JP Morgan, Bloomberg, SNWAM Research",

    "content": "<p> We&rsquo;re in a hurry to get everywhere, but generally speaking, you need to know where you&rsquo;re going in order to get there (the exception of course being a wander for wandering&rsquo;s sake, which is a whole other subject).</p><p> So it is surprising the number of times I&rsquo;m asked by a prospective client&mdash;or even a friend needing some marketing advice&mdash;for my thoughts on the exact campaign they should doing &ldquo;right now.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve even heard people experience this in interview situations too, when the hiring manager asks, &ldquo;so what big campaign should we do?&rdquo;</p><p> This kind of question is like asking someone to plot a course to nowhere, and no one is going to get very far that way. Before the &ldquo;what should the campaign be&rdquo; question, we need to address the &ldquo;what is your goal&rdquo; question. I know, I know&mdash;taking about a goal takes time and thinking. But without understanding the objective, you&rsquo;re unlikely to get a solid result.</p><h3> A goal doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated. In fact, most marketing objectives fall into three basic categories: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Awareness: </strong> Ye olde &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t buy from you if they don&rsquo;t know you&rdquo; scenario comes into play here. Awareness as a marketing strategy has been in style, out of style, and back in style. It is still a core objective for many marketers, although how to go about generating awareness has changed quite a bit over the years. One of the great aspects of modern marketing is you can generate focused awareness, i.e. making sure that the right target market gets your awareness message. The other nice thing about awareness is that it can often be baked into other marketing strategies.</p><p> <strong>  2. Acquisition: </strong> This is a pretty common marketing goal, and often follows after some awareness efforts. Acquisition is all about filling the sales pipeline&mdash;whether your sales cycle is days, weeks or months. With acquisition stated as your primary goal, your marketing team and agency can sharpen the lens on campaigns and programs that are going to be most effective at driving new customers in the door. And may I take the liberty of a Public Service Announcement on behalf of consumers when I say: if you launch an aggressive acquisition campaign, be sure to have the customer service and new account response teams to back it up.</p><p> <strong>  3. Retention: </strong> Your easiest next sale is from one of your current customers. Customer retention is as critical to business growth as acquisition (and some marketing leaders I know have said retention is more important than acquisition&mdash;as the saying goes, if you don&rsquo;t have customers, you don&rsquo;t have a company). Satisfied customers will continue to buy from you, and they&rsquo;ll also provide one of the most reliable sources of new business&mdash;word of mouth. Even if you don&rsquo;t plan to engage in a customer retention campaign, be sure your acquisition campaigns don&rsquo;t alienate your current customers.</p><p> The next time you want to run the best campaign ever, start with the destination&mdash;is it awareness, or a hybrid of awareness-acquisition? <strong>  When you do, you&rsquo;ll have much better odds of a successful arrival.  </strong></p>",

Wealth Managers, for example, continue to charge annual fees of around 1% even when a large portion of investments are managed through index funds instead of actively. But rather than displace financial advisors, using this same technology to streamline their own businesses has allowed some professionals to zero-in on what they do best while providing more transparent, less expensive investment advisory services for clients.</p><h3> Fooling Some of the People Some of the Time</h3><p> <br/> Wealth Management is a $5 trillion dollar industry and hidden investment fees are the shame of the investment advisory business, especially at old school brokerage firms. Even passive index funds may kickback a hidden 1% fee to a broker. These hidden fees erode investment returns 1% a year or a whopping $17 billion, leading to as much as a 12% reduction in retirement income, according to a recent  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/23/effects-conflicted-investment-advice-retirement-savings\" target=\"_blank\">   report on investment advice and retirement savings  </a> </u>  by the President&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA).</p><p> Wealth management firms need to rebuild trust and relationships with the investment community. Those who have focused on client relationship building alone, however, have watched their clients jump ship for digital investment platforms. &ldquo;Our research shows that firms that integrate digital tools into their business models will help strengthen these relationships rather than threaten them, and in fact help them attract the most lucrative investors,&rdquo; says Owen Jelf, global managing director of Accenture&rsquo;s Capital Markets practice.</p><p> Online investment services, including the robo-advisors, are forcing their human counterparts to be on top of their game. Big banks and brokerages in fear of once again becoming technology laggards (remember eTrade and the online trading revolution?) are moving quickly to add a robo-portfolio management option. At the very least, they&rsquo;re adding comparable investment products and services, and of course there&rsquo;s the pricing.</p><p> <strong>  The advent of digital wealth managers is helping individual investors in three big ways: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Access to Professional Portfolio Services </strong>  &ndash; Investors no longer have to pay high fees to obtain professional portfolio advisory services, nor do they have to compromise on quality. TradeKing &ndash; among the least expensive of the discount brokers &ndash; now provides personalized, automated portfolios on par with some high net worth wealth managers. At the same time, more wealth managers who used to snub anyone with less than $1 million in assets to invest are now lowering their minimum requirements and seeking out mass-affluents.</li><li> <strong>  More Transparency </strong>  &ndash; Investors can and should demand complete disclosure from financial advisors today. Since the mortgage crisis, individual investors have shown a very low tolerance for opaque financial transactions. Human advisors are under pressure to disclose as much information as robo-offerings, which are targeting/aimed at 75 million millennials who have grown up in a more transparent digital world. </li><li> <strong>  Lower Fees </strong>  &ndash; Robo-advisors charge fees that are often less than half of the 1% charged by typical investment advisors. A lot of independent advisors (who aren&rsquo;t captive to big brokerage firms) are quietly lowering fees to compete with their digital counterparts. <br/>  </li><h3> Best of Both</h3><p> <br/> All this new technology is exposing financial advisor practices and demanding more fee transparency. Still, it doesn&rsquo;t mean robo-advisors exist to assassinate human advisors. In reality, robo-advice can complement human investment advice and save money in the process. Model portfolios cost less to construct and the savings actually helps clients to access other specialized advisory services such as tax advice, real estate investment or estate planning. Clients can have the best of both worlds using a package deal &ndash; robo-generated portfolios plus on-going highly personalized human financial guidance (at a much more affordable annual fee of .75%, as an example).</p><h3> Money is Emotional, and Relationships Matter</h3><p> <br/> Not all investors are ready to replace personal human interaction with algorithms. Money is and always has been, emotional. When someone dies, sells a business or gets divorced, turning to the robot doesn&rsquo;t have much appeal. Real people want human interaction along with a personalized, customized investment plan. Not to mention a fiduciary relationship that a robot cannot offer. Individual investors are all for lower fees, but technology has limits. For example,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/putting-robo-advisers-to-the-test-1429887456\" target=\"_blank\">   a robo-advisor survey by theWall Street Journal  </a> </u>  shows different robo-advisors produced different portfolios for investors with the exact same investor profiles. Also, robo-generated investing plans don&rsquo;t appeal to investors looking for actively managed portfolios.</p><p> More everyday investors will move toward some combination of human and online help to manage their investments and deal with serious life events that drive big financial decisions. Clearly, they will choose the investment advisors who offer full transparency. These innovations empower individual investors and put clients in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Doesn&rsquo;t it sometimes feel like marketing deliberately makes itself sound way more complicated than it needs to be? I myself have found myself choking on my own jargon and buzz words that mean something to my industry, but are simply worthless to anyone else. To be fair, any industry can get lost in its own language. I&rsquo;ll say that for marketing your small business, you don&rsquo;t need CMO level credentials to do some amazing marketing to grow your business. Marketing complexity doesn&rsquo;t need to confound the small business looking to implement winning marketing strategies for your product or service, nor should it.</p><p> Marketing your small business shouldn&rsquo;t be complicated. In fact, I&rsquo;ll argue it should be the fun and enjoyable part of the business. It&rsquo;s the part where you focus on the customer, how your business serves that customer and how you can appeal to even more people with your amazing product or service. In a real basic sense, marketing should work like this illustration.  (And please let&rsquo;s not all get offended. This is an equal opportunity piece right here.)</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tarzan-see-Jane..png\"/></p><p>  </p><p> Think about strategy in a more simplified and stripped down way so that you focus on what you should do versus everything you could do. After all, clarity in message, execution and service is a winning combination. There are so many solutions and avenues to explore when marketing your business, but you don&rsquo;t need to get tangled up in all of them all at once.</p><p> The questions you need to answer are the most basic and fundamental pieces of information required in any great story:</p><h3> Who, What, When, Why, Where and How</h3><p> <br/> If your small business can answer  <strong>  who </strong>  your customer is,  <strong>  what </strong>  value your product or service adds to their life,  <strong>  when </strong>  they give attention and purchase,  <strong>  why </strong>  they should choose your product or service over anyone else&rsquo;s,  <strong>  where </strong>  they will encounter your brand and  <strong>  where </strong>  they will purchase and  <strong>  how </strong>  you are going to deliver your message and measure success&hellip; I think you have a pretty darn clear start. Don&rsquo;t overthink it. These questions should be easy to answer.</p><p> Additionally, a marketing strategy is only as good as its mission and goals. What are you trying to accomplish with your marketing efforts? Be so specific it&rsquo;s painful. The more granular your goals, the more focused your efforts and your ability to measure effectiveness. If you document your goal(s) and answer these basic questions, choosing tactics and implementing them will be much easier and fun than you may have originally thought.</p><p> Align your efforts with your customer and you&rsquo;re already leaps ahead of others.</p><p> Here is a simple example to illustrate:</p><p> <strong>  Business: </strong>  Bob the Plumber, independent with a few assistants</p><p> <strong>  Marketing Goal: </strong>  Increase referrals to his business through existing clients</p><p> <strong>  Who (ideal customer): </strong>  Lisa (30-something homeowner)</p><p> <strong>  What: </strong>  Bob the Plumber, offering same day reliable and affordable plumbing services to fix any residential plumbing need.</p><p> <strong>  When: </strong>  It&rsquo;s needed most &ndash; urgent need or scheduled service. 24/7, because no one plans to have plumbing issues.</p><p> <strong>  Why: </strong>  Bob&rsquo;s certified, been in business over 30 years and fixes the problem same-day at residential rates. And he&rsquo;s Bob and everyone loves Bob.</p><p> <strong>  Where:  </strong> Former customers, online (peer-review sites)</p><p> <strong>  How: </strong>  Do a damn good job, website presence, local offers / happy new and returning customers, redemption of offers</p><p> So where should Bob concentrate his marketing effort?  Bob&rsquo;s goal is to increase referrals from existing clients. Bob will probably be most effective by staying in touch with his former happy clients and making it easy for them to refer business his way. </p><li> Bob could send them monthly emails to remain top of mind. He should include a clear call-to-action by providing special offers that his customers can use or share with friends.</li><li> If a former customer recommends Bob, they may very well go to Yelp to read other reviews, so Bob can set up special deals on Yelp to encourage action.</li><li> Having a website will only help more people be able to find Bob any time of the day and get his contact information or schedule with him online. </li><li> Featuring client testimonials on his website would also be a great way to leverage happy clients. </li><li> Bob can create a Facebook page that all his happy clients can like and get useful information about home plumbing maintenence and &ldquo;what to do when&hellip;&rdquo;  </li><li> Creating helpful content tailored specifically for his clients.</li><li> Serving the heck out of his clients and showing lots of gratitude. <br/>  </li><p> There are so many other awesome activities to explore with this one simple example and the joy with marketing is that you may try something and it works (winning!) or maybe it doesn&rsquo;t work as well as you thought it would and then you adjust. The most important takeaway is that all of your efforts point back to your goal and can be measured in some way. Just as every great piece of writing has a clear thesis statement, so should every great strategy have clearly defined goal. I know this sounds so basic, but it is such an excellent place to begin. You can then continue to add more details, tactics and campaigns to your strategy when you have the core outline of your strategy defined and documented.</p><p> Here are just a few more really simple, low or no cost thoughts to leave you with:</p><p> <strong>  YOU CAN get the word out there about your business. </strong></p><p> The world is more connected now than ever thanks to social media. Social media can be your small business&rsquo; best platform for getting the word out there and letting people know who you are, who you serve and how they can find you. Social media is free free free. Seriously, there are no gimmicks. I know a wonderful small business that gets all their business through word-of-mouth and their Facebook business page.</p><p> <strong>  YOU CAN nurture potential, existing and new customers with email. </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mailchimp </a>  offers a completely free email solution for your small business. It even comes with the necessary WordPress plugins to maintain your list of subscribers right in your free Mailchimp account.  If you are collecting subscribers for your newsletter or promotion, Mailchimp easily maintains these for you and then you can easily follow-up.</p><p> <strong>  YOU CAN remain present on social, even when you&rsquo;re busy. </strong></p><p> Running a small business or working full time for one means you don&rsquo;t have as much time to be on social media all day long. Not a problem. Schedule your posts in advance so that when you do have time so you can be active on your preferred social media accounts anyway.  <a href=\"http://www.buffer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Buffer </a>  has a completely no-cost publishing service that allows you to set your queue and get on with your day. Just like you make time to check email throughout the day, just make it a good habit to check in on social as well so you maintain real-time engagement.</p><p> <strong>  YOU CAN establish trust and credibility for your brand. </strong></p><p> Writing a blog or filming a video blog are the best ways to build trust and establish credibility. Write or film, either way, with a computer or a smartphone &ndash; you have all the tools you need to get it done and publish online. Have you seen some of those iPhone videos? Seriously. It&rsquo;s like movie magic. Your everyday technology empowers pretty impressive DIY when you don&rsquo;t have a huge production budget.</p><p> <strong>  YOU CAN make connections. </strong></p><p> Don&rsquo;t forget, people are the most important part of your business. Good old hustle is still effective, so get out of your business and be meeting and talking to people. Don&rsquo;t be a secret business. Tell your family, friends, church members, doctor, hair stylist, etc. You don&rsquo;t need to sell them anything, it&rsquo;s simply just part of who you are and you should let people know.</p><p> Your small business marketing strategy doesn&rsquo;t need to be complex and multilayered for you to reach some of your goals. Based on your goals, your customer and your budget &ndash; do the things you know you can do right now to be successful in your marketing efforts. And if it seems too easy to work, well then it actually might work!</p><p> Your marketing efforts will grow with your growing business. Do what you can. Do it well. And have fun.</p>",

    "content": "<p> It was one year ago that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-im-adding-bitcoins-to-my-retirement-portfolio-2014-05-22\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I invested my yearly SEP contribution into bitcoins  </a> </u> . </p><p> Actually, it was into something called the  <u>  <a href=\"http://cointelegraph.com/news/114209/shares-of-bitcoin-investment-trust-surge-after-much-anticipated-debut\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bitcoin Investment Trust  </a> </u> , which at the time was the only investment vehicle that I could find after researching options for investing qualified retirement funds into bitcoin. At the time bitcoin was trading in the $500 to $600 range.</p><p> Six months ago,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-i-lost-half-of-my-retirement-investment-in-bitcoins-2014-10-07\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I wrote about losing half of my investment  </a> </u>  in the Trust and received much \"love\" from those who had sympathy for me (actually I'm still looking for those comments but I'm sure that someone out there does care). I also was very clear at the time that there was no need to worry that I'd be \"dumpster diving\" for my next meal because I was doing what every investor needs to do &mdash; proper asset allocation. Meanwhile bitcoin was trading in the $400 to $300 range, and no one likes losing money.</p><p> My investment in the Trust and bitcoin is a small portion of my investment portfolio and considered as part of the alternative investment class of my overall investment portfolio. Some of you have gold, oil wells or real estate in that category. I prefer things less tangible (I read a lot of science fiction growing up).</p><p> So here I am, one year later. Bitcoin is trading at $230 as I'm writing this. Maybe it's time to listen to the naysayers and realize that it's time to give up and just recognize that bitcoin is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme, a harsh trick played on people from a guy named Satoshi and little more than the outlawed game of Three-Card Monty that was so popular before Mickey Mouse invaded my beloved Times Square?</p><p> Before writing this article, I decided that before I could put the nail in my bitcoin \"folly,&rdquo; I wanted to get a better view of the current bitcoin landscape, so I went to the  <u>  Inside Bitcoins conference in New York City </u>  to see if in fact, the end of bitcoin is around the corner, as so many commenters had said to me six months ago.</p><p> What I walked away with was a cautiously optimistic outlook on bitcoin, but an overwhelming level of respect for something called the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-just-reached-another-milestone-in-its-road-to-legitimacy-2015-05-18\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blockchain  </a> </u> . Without going into too many technical aspects, the blockchain is the \"ledger\" that all bitcoin transactions are recorded on. When you recognize that this provides a decentralized and permanent record of all of these transactions, you soon come to understand why  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-blockchain-technology-dominic-frisby-2015-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   venture capital is pouring into  </a> </u>  new ventures that use the blockchain.</p><p> New companies that are looking to use the power of the blockchain include  <u>  <a href=\"http://factom.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Factom  </a> </u> , which is a company that plans to create a method that will allow for the permanent storage of records such as land titles, medical records, books, and pretty much anything that requires being reported, through the use of the blockchain.</p><p> When I spoke with the CEO of Factom, Peter Kirby, you realize that he's not only the \"smartest guy in the room\" but he's also keenly aware of the skepticism that exists about bitcoin and the blockchain. Although there is a rush of venture capital out there for blockchain companies, Kirby has decided to also raise money for his company through a channel called  <u>  Koinify </u> , which allows anyone to invest in startups such as Factom. Kirby explains that his reasoning for seeking investors through that channel was due more to the need to build a community, rather than it being the only channel available to him.</p><p> By selling \"factoids,&rdquo; the Factom form of cybercurrency to new investors, Koinify allows Factom to reach a wider range of investors, who can become enthusiasts for the application, while allowing any investor to participate in the start up of a company. It does require that you purchase factoids with bitcoin, but in case you haven't noticed, the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/buy-bitcoin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   opportunities to buy bitcoin  </a> </u>  have grown immensely from a year ago when I began my efforts to do that.</p><p> So, one year later, I'm still out over half of my original investment. Because of the structure of the investment, I can't get out of it (although it will soon transfer into an exchange-traded fund type of investment soon and will trade on an exchange). Yet, I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing in not only the advancements around bitcoin, including the wide range of opportunities for the blockchain, as well as the level of intelligence and enthusiasm around the individuals and executives involved in the companies in this space.</p><p> There have been many comparisons between what is currently occurring with bitcoin and when the Internet first became widely known. There were intelligent and enthusiastic people at the start of the Internet days as well. Money was made and money was lost. I'm sure that will happen again (I guess I'm living proof of that).</p><p> I'm fortunate enough to be alive and around long enough to see how the Internet has been one of those rare things that actually did change the world. I look forward to seeing whether bitcoin and the blockchain can do the same thing.</p><p> Until that happens, I'd just like to see my original investment return. Hope springs eternal ...</p>",

    "content": "<p> You certainly recall the phrase, &lsquo;sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can never hurt you'.  Well, my life experience, and no doubt yours, has proven this wrong. Sound is as likely to cause us to fight or flee as much as placing our hand upon a hot stove. It can elicit the exact same automatic reflex.  When was the last time you were awakened from sleep from an unknown bang or clap of thunder? How did you feel? Was your heart nice and calm and your limbs relaxed? Highly unlikely. And when sound comes in the form of words, it can cause great emotional pain.</p><p> The result of our brain detecting possible danger is the outpouring of a lot of electro-chemical juice. That juice gives us the typical feeling we feel when we are startled, but also can just as easily lead us to fight&mdash;anger and rage. When we hear the sounds of someone yelling at us, having a tantrum, blaming us, whatever, that sends a strong single to our brain that tells us we are being attacked and better prepare to fight or flee.</p><p> This not only applies to adults, of course. It is readily apparent in children. Often when a child tantrums, it elicits anger in the parent. And when anger appears, <strong>  it   always   means our brain has detected a threat, because anger is a fight reaction. </strong> What is the threat? The threat is that this child will not end up being a good representative of that parent or is usurping the parent&rsquo;s power (i.e. one-upping). Yes, it is that personal, although usually the threat sits below the level of awareness and manifests only as anger in the parent.</p><p> What I believe is more important to focus on are not the fighting words, but what has caused someone to utter them. In my estimation, the words are less important than the actual trigger and will hurt less if we recognize this. When someone goes on an angry rant, it is a fight reaction that is really saying, &ldquo;I am scared, I am frustrated, I am insecure, I am vulnerable, I am threatened.\" Does this give them a pass? No. But when you recognize this you can prevent yourself from getting triggered by it and thus continuing the fight.</p><h3> Here are six ways to emerge a winner from an argument: <br/>  </h3><li> Say, &ldquo;It is apparent that you are upset. I need to excuse myself for a minute.&rdquo; You can even use the excuse that you have to go to the bathroom!</li><li> When removed, take ten &ldquo;box breaths&rdquo;. That is, inhale for a count of six, hold for a count of two, and exhale for a count of six.</li><li> Repeat in your mind, &ldquo;There is no danger, there is no threat, I am safe.&rdquo;</li><li> While away from the anger, attempt to figure out what is the true reason for this person to be so angry. For example, do they feel impotent because they don&rsquo;t make enough money, or they are scared about a new opportunity, or they feel insecure about your relationship?</li><li> Return back with peace of mind. Let them know that you are there for them, if they wish to discuss the issue civilly, without yelling. If not, leave again (this is not fleeing, but mindfully separating yourself from danger).</li><li> Fully let go of any hurtful words and realize they are more about the other person&rsquo;s sense of danger, threat, or vulnerability than something you ought to take personally. When you can do this, you have truly won. </li>",

    "content": "<h3>Understand what an emotion is</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An emotion is a &ldquo;stirred up reaction&rdquo; such as love, hate, fear, anger or grief. An emotion is aroused when a person views something as either good or bad. However, an emotion does not always have an external cause; it can also be created internally, that is, by a person&rsquo;s thoughts. We are the source of all our emotions. Therefore, feeling good is a decision!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all have emotions, and those of us who do not hide our emotions are referred to as emotional. I believe that we are born without emotions and that we learn our emotions the same way we learn to read and write. Our parents even teach us how to react emotionally to certain circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two kinds of emotions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are only two types of emotions: negative emotions and positive emotions. Negative emotions, including anger, fear and despair, make us feel unhappy or dissatisfied. Positive emotions, including love, joy and hope, are aroused by something that appeals to us.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmotions come in varying degrees of strength. For example, we could call a very happy person overjoyed. Unfortunately, happiness is only possible if we learn to cope with our negative emotions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmotions can be very helpful. For example, in fear, the adrenal gland empties a hormone called adrenaline into the bloodstream, increasing the heart rate and raising the blood pressure. Much blood shifts from our digestive organs to the brain and skeletal muscles. The breathing rate increases as large amounts of sugar are dumped into the bloodstream. These emergency measures give the body added energy to face the crisis at hand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the hormone adrenaline causes the face to go pale and the mouth to go dry when we experience fear, the hormone called noradrenalin, causes our face to become flushed when we are angry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Emotional overload</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If changes in our body continue for a prolonged period of time, tissue damage can result. For example, constant worry and fear can produce stomach ulcers. Strong emotions can make it hard to think, concentrate and solve problems. Worry will drain valuable mental energy needed to function creatively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmotional overload occurs when pent-up emotions become too great to bear and must be released, often through uncontrollable weeping. This explains why a person in emotional overload may weep at times without apparent reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The fear-adrenaline cycle</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I experienced the fear-adrenaline cycle in a terrifying way when burnout struck with gale force. As I felt the waves of anxiety roll over me, the adrenaline rushed into my system, causing even greater fear and anxiety, probably because I was unaware of exactly what was happening. I thought I was &ldquo;going nuts.&rdquo; Eventually, I learned to simply relax; I began to be thankful that God was in control of His entire creation, instead of trying to fight those awful feelings. As my mind was put to rest because of putting my faith in God, peace would begin to flood my whole being.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Indentify your emotions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At times in our lives, we all feel negative emotions &ndash; depression or worry or anger or hurt or guilt or frustration, or loneliness, to name a few. The first step to taking control of our emotions is to identify what we are really feeling inside. Secondly, we must accept the fact that our emotions are calling us to action. Thirdly, we need to realize that we have the power to change direction and take action.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;ve been following my blog for sometime, you know that I&rsquo;m relatively open with what goes on in the Storjohann household in terms of finances. Some may think it&rsquo;s weird, but I think it adds a level of transparency and ultimately shows that I, like everyone else, have my share of financial roadblocks.</p><p> The below post is not meant for everybody. It&rsquo;s a very specific post that I&rsquo;ve felt compelled to write for some time and targets an issue that many couples today are facing, but that most also will never encounter. So feel free to read on if it applies, if you&rsquo;re curious, or if you think there&rsquo;s someone you know who may benefit.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.resolve.org/about/fast-facts-about-fertility.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Approximately one in eight couples experience some form of infertility issues  </a> </u> . My husband, Brian and I contribute to this statistic. When Brian and I first married, he was gung-ho to get on the baby-making-train right away. I however, was hesitant.</p><p> I wanted to build my career, to travel, to have freedom&hellip; you name it. It took a few years for me to come around, but when I was finally ready to start a family,  it&hellip; well, it wasn&rsquo;t happening.</p><p> After the obligatory year of trying, the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stress&rdquo; comments, the  &ldquo;just get drunk&rdquo; comments and more, we started the round of tests to see if there was an issue. And to our surprise, there was. What proceeded was a yearlong adventure through the world of treatments, prescriptions, roller coaster hormone rides, and an IVF cycle, which ultimately culminated in a pregnancy as I&rsquo;m now about 28 weeks along.</p><p> The world of infertility is a scary and complicated place. The word itself is taboo and makes people feel uncomfortable. Add that in with the issues people have in being comfortable with their finances and you typically have an icky situation.</p><p> Coping with the treatments, terminology and outflow of cash can be a stressful time. Here are the ways we handled it in our household (on the financial front) and what I&rsquo;d recommend to anyone facing down the same beast.</p><h3> Step 1: Stop. Breathe. Call Your Insurance Company</h3><p> Upon receiving the referral or recommendation to consult with an infertility specialist, that is your cue to pick up the phone and find out every detail you can about your coverage.</p><p> What&rsquo;s covered and what isn&rsquo;t? Are diagnostic tests included? Prescriptions? Treatments? The consultation with the specialist itself?</p><p> You won&rsquo;t have a lot of details to give your insurance provider at this point (aside from possibly knowing part of the issue behind the referral), but it will help to understand the amount of coverage you may or may not have with treatments.</p><p> <strong>  Questions to Ask: </strong></p><li> Which procedures require preauthorization?</li><li> Does preauthorization need to be done for each cycle of treatment and how long does it take to get?</li><li> Are there restrictions on the type of healthcare provider who can perform infertility services?</li><li> Are there limits to the number of procedures or the maximum dollar limit on benefits?</li><li> Is there a co-payment for medical services? <br/>  </li><h3> Step 2: Schedule and Attend Your Consultation (Bring Your Partner and a Notebook)</h3><p> I can&rsquo;t stress enough how important it is to bring a pen and paper and take COPIOUS notes during this meeting. There is going to be a lot thrown at you.</p><p> Do not attend this meeting without a partner and any appointments or meetings without a buddy, especially in the initial weeks of appointments. You&rsquo;re going to be overwhelmed with information so it&rsquo;s important to ensure you have someone else there asking the questions that need to be asked and getting clarification.</p><p> Brian did a lot of the note-taking while I asked a lot of the questions. This allowed us to ensure we covered and documented everything.</p><h3> Step 3: Ask (More) Questions</h3><p> Most fertility clinics have a variety of departments they send you through. The doctors make the medical recommendations, but don&rsquo;t discuss the finances. The nurses and assistants do scheduling and hold appointments, but also don&rsquo;t discuss the finances.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a distinct department for that and you&rsquo;ll likely need to hold your questions around the money until you get shuffled into the appropriate office.</p><p> This is where it&rsquo;s incredibly important to ask the doctor about the following in regards to your recommended course of treatment:</p><li> What diagnostic tests are needed?</li><li> What prescriptions are specifically involved and the quantities?</li><li> What is the breakdown of steps in the treatment?</li><li> How many cycles are being recommended in your treatment plan before another course of action may need to be considered?</li><li> What are the next steps if the recommended course doesn&rsquo;t work? <br/>  </li><p> Once you have the breakdown of the recommendations, you can then sit down with the financial consultant and begin to review costs. Ask about every line item and detail and ensure you have a dollar figure next to each prescription, treatment and test.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t worry about crunching the numbers while you&rsquo;re there. You can process that when you get home.</p><h3> Step 4: Call Your Insurance Company (Again) and Do That Question Asking Thing</h3><p> Once you&rsquo;re back home and able to process, it&rsquo;s time again to make the call to your insurance company again and ask more detailed questions about your recommended course of treatment. (I swear I had Tricare on speed dial by the end of this).</p><li> Is there a co-payment for drug coverage and is prior authorization required for these medications?</li><li> Does the plan cover self-administered subcutaneous (under the skin) or oral medications?</li><li> Are there discounts for mail-order medications?</li><li> Will the treatment/procedure/medication be covered under my current coverage or under my major medical portion?</li><li> If yes, is there any limit of any kind-dollar amount or number of attempts? If no, are any portions of the charges covered for prescription medication, laboratory tests or ultrasounds leading up to treatment? <br/>  </li><p> Note: Creating spreadsheets to track all of the numbers is totally fine and recommended. We especially did this when it came to shopping around for the best prices on our prescriptions for IVF. We&rsquo;re talking  <strong>  hundreds </strong>  of dollars saved by making a few phone calls.</p><h3> Step 5: Have a Glass of Wine, Cup of Tea or Take a Walk</h3><p> At this point you&rsquo;re probably so worked up and boggled down by numbers, recommendations and unknown vocabulary terms that you need to unwind. Take some time to yourself to get away and clear your mind. Everything will be there when you get back and it&rsquo;s best to de-stress in the midst of all this so you can think clearly as to what&rsquo;s best for you and your family.</p><p> Girls&rsquo; nights, date nights, letting the tears (and hormones) flow and late night calls with my best friend helped me immensely through this process as did building Workable Wealth and working with couples across the country to help them meet their goals. Determine what will help you cope on the road ahead and allow yourself time to process.</p><h3> Step 6: Review Your Financial Situation</h3><p> Now that you have a general idea of what the treatments will cost you with and without insurance, it&rsquo;s time to look at your own personal financial situation. Specifically, you&rsquo;ll want to review:</p><li> Your current savings account balances</li><li> Your current debt load</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/back-to-basics-with-the-b-word/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Your budget and areas you may be able to cut back on  </a> </u>  to make room for upcoming payments</li><li> Amounts you&rsquo;re stashing away for other goals like travel, down payments, etc. <br/>  </li><p> Determine where you currently stand in these areas. If you&rsquo;re not the kind of couple that has a budget in place, now is certainly the time to take action in that category. It&rsquo;s going to be incredibly important to understand where your money is going in the months ahead.</p><h3> Step 6: Prioritize</h3><p> There isn&rsquo;t a price that can be put on building or starting your family. Each couple and situation is unique and you have to determine where this phase and step falls on your list of priorities.</p><p> If you are currently saving up for a home down payment or a big trip, is that money that you&rsquo;ll reallocate towards the medical payments for treatment? Perhaps you&rsquo;ll cease making contributions and reallocate any future savings amounts towards your family planning goal.</p><p> What are you willing to trim back on in order to go down this course and make room for the expenses? Only you can decide that.</p><h3> Step 7: Create a Plan</h3><p> Now that you&rsquo;ve reviewed and prioritized, it&rsquo;s time to put together a plan and determine:</p><li> How much do you currently have in savings that you can allocate towards payments without wiping out your emergency fund? Remember, this isn&rsquo;t an emergency (as much as it feels like one).</li><li> What areas will you be cutting back on in order to save more for treatments?</li><li> Will you open up a separate savings account to handle all expenses and treatments?</li><li> If you don&rsquo;t have the funds on hand to currently cover the costs, will you continue to save and build up your cushion or will you finance the expenses?</li><li> Should you obtain a second opinion and perhaps shop around for more affordable (but still quality) care? <br/>  </li><h3> Step 8: Review the Fine Print on Lending</h3><p> Should you choose to go the financing route, consider if loans from parents or a family member may be feasible or affordable first.</p><p> Your doctor&rsquo;s office will likely have a recommended lender, but be weary of high interest rates and any kickbacks your provider may receive for recommending them. Shop around for better loan terms on your credit cards, personal lines of credit from the bank and consider other creative ways to fund the treatments if you&rsquo;re insistent on borrowing.</p><p> Remember the higher the interest rate, the higher the amount you&rsquo;re tacking on to what is likely already a four or five-digit number. Do your research here!</p><h3> Step 9: Get Creative, Start Saving &amp; Make Adjustments</h3><p> Fertility treatments are by no means a walk in the park, but if you&rsquo;re being forced to spend money and it is money that you may already have set aside, take advantage of the costs by using a credit card that will earn you points towards travel or cash back.</p><p> We would put all of our medical bills on our credit card and then immediately transfer the money from our savings to make a payment. This allowed us to stock up on travel points that we&rsquo;ve cashed in for trips over the past few months.</p><p> Now is the time to open up a separate savings account for this goal and set up your automatic monthly transfers. If you&rsquo;re not using mint.com already, you should have your accounts synced up and be closely monitoring the areas you&rsquo;re cutting back in.</p><h3> Step 10: Stay Flexible, but Know Your Limit</h3><p> There&rsquo;s no straight path or guarantees when it comes to what will work. Our path lead us from the DIY route, to some prescriptions, to IUIs, to more prescriptions and giving myself shots, to IVF. (Imagine the dollar amount climbing exponentially here.)</p><p> We were flexible, but we had a limit and one round of IVF was it for me &ndash; physically, emotionally and financially. If it didn&rsquo;t work after one round, adoption was our route and we were okay with that.</p><p> As mentioned previously, you can&rsquo;t put a price on building a family &ndash; but it is important to know your limit. How much is too much money and/or too much time spent in these areas?</p><p> If a treatment is not working, it may be best to take a physical and financial break and circle back when you have the funds built up again. It&rsquo;s hard to keep the numbers in mind with such an emotional issue, but as it goes with many things with your finances, you shouldn&rsquo;t put all of your eggs in one basket.</p><p> While you may want to throw everything you can at this goal (which could work for a period of time), you can&rsquo;t let it wreck financial havoc on your life. Remember to simultaneously continue saving for retirement, work back into stashing away in your travel fund and take time to dream and plan for other goals you have as a couple as well.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In this case, how you say it is just as important as what you&rsquo;re saying. How can that be possible you ask? If you&rsquo;re planning to entwine your  <u>  audience </u>  in your  <u>  brand </u> , you&rsquo;ve got to speak their language and understand their expectations. I&rsquo;ll demonstrate by comparing two different  <u>  brands </u>  selling similar products and discuss how the way they address their consumer is appropriate for their audience.</p><h3> <strong>  Athletic Wear &ndash; Compared </strong></h3><br /><p> <u>  Lululemon </u>  is an athletic brand that defines their target customer as &ldquo;A sophisticated and educated woman who understands the importance of an active, healthy lifestyle. She is increasingly tasked with the dual responsibilities of career and family and is constantly challenged to balance her work, life and health&hellip;she pursues exercise to achieve physical fitness and inner peace.&rdquo; Read their brand manifesto  <u>  here </u>  and you&rsquo;ll see there&rsquo;s femininity to the brand, a peaceful acceptance that comes from the practice of yoga, and a nurturing side that encourages their audience to take new risks. Their brand voice and tone is spot on for their target audience, and it&rsquo;s catered to and reflective of their target consumer. They carry this through  <u>  their blog </u>  and their social media postings.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p><p> Compare the Lululemon brand to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Under Armour  </a> </u> . Both brands sell athletic wear. Under Armour targets a very different customer, and accordingly uses a very different brand voice. Just like Lululemon, there&rsquo;s a stirring, motivational message in the Under Armour brand. However, if you watch any of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://sportsbusinessnow.com/under-armour-protecting-wide-brand-image-with-i-will-campaign/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &lsquo;I Will&rsquo; global campaign  </a> </u>  and you&rsquo;ll get a sense of the difference. There&rsquo;s a competitive thread in their message, a ragged edge that&rsquo;s less about acceptance and more about performance. Their brand voice says &ldquo;work harder, push further, win more.&rdquo; The first Under Armour slogan was &ldquo;We Must Protect This House,&rdquo; and one of their mottos is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nysportsjournalism.com/can-under-armour-run-over-nike/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &lsquo;Stay Hungry. Be Humble.&rsquo;  </a> </u></p><h3> Why Brand Voice Matters</h3><p> <br/> When you set out to speak in the voice of your brand, look to your target customer and understand first how they speak, think, and what they expect from you. Pick up on the voice they want to hear, and let that color the way you write, speak, and the content you create. Using the wrong brand voice or speaking from a place that&rsquo;s not authentic is the fastest way to lose your audience. Authenticity is one of the fastest ways to draw them in.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not the only one who think this way, an article by  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisaarthur\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lisa Arthur  </a> </u>  on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaarthur/2013/02/13/is-your-content-authentic-three-ways-to-keep-it-real/\" target=\"_blank\">   Authentic Content  </a> </u>  advises readers that &ldquo;today&rsquo;s savvy buyers crave authenticity.&rdquo; So, you&rsquo;d better figure out the language of your customer, and start speaking it today so you can engage with them.</p><p> Understanding your brand voice and using it consistently is the fastest way to growing a loyal fan base.</p><p> Can you give some examples of brands that show off their brand voice?</p>",

    "content": "<p> We have all likely been in a situation like this before. We ask, or tell, a subordinate to do something, a task, and in our mind we are crystal clear as to what we want. After some time they report that the task is done. Much to our amazement (or chagrin, or anger, you fill in the emotion) the task is not done to our standards. We are beside ourselves with (fill in another emotion) and decide to take action&hellip; My question, are you dissatisfied with the performance, or are you mad at the performer? Does it matter, you ask? Well, it could be shaping how the performer sees you (or doesn&rsquo;t see you) as a leader. This is not just splitting hairs, or an exercise in semantics. Here is why.</p><h3> Mad at the Performer</h3><p> <br/> When I am angry with the performer, what I am saying is that  they , the follower, let me down. I am operating under the belief that  they  had a perfect understanding of what I wanted.  They  read my mind perfectly.  They  had the exact same investment in that task that I had. They  knew exactly how to perform the task. Notice though, where the focus is. Is it on you as a leader or on them, the follower? When you, as a &ldquo;leader&rdquo; blame them, see them as the entire source of the bad outcome, you are by definition not being a leader. They were the ones who were asked to meet standards that were perhaps ambiguous or confusing. They were acting within the parameters of their understanding or skillset.</p><h3> Dissatisfied with the Performance</h3><p> <br/> If I am dissatisfied with the performance, I am admitting that I have a part in the performance.  I , as a &ldquo;leader&rdquo; did not give clear enough directions.  I  did not ensure that they understood what I wanted.  I , also, now can focus on what  I  need to do in the future with this performer to help them, and us, achieve success in whatever endeavors we are working on. As a leader, as a coach, as a mentor, the sooner you start to believe that the quality of performance is a direct reflection of  your  leadership, the sooner you can start achieving the success you desire.</p><p> So, if you are mad at anyone, be mad at yourself. Direct your anger to the real culprit here, you. You are the one, as a leader, who can control the conversations you have, the moods you live in, the futures you create.  As for me, I am going to go attempt to have some better conversations with my team. I have some performances I want to help them improve.</p>",

    "content": "<p> My wife is the clear CFO in our family. It took us several years of marriage to figure this out but she manages the money in our family. Even though I have spent much of my career in financial services, Diane controls the checkbook. She is gifted with an eye for detail and well organized. She also happens to be prudent and frugal and enjoys the responsibility more than I.  We of course make investment decisions together and often discuss tactics, plans and goals. But basically she controls the money flow, both short-term and long-term investments for our family.</p><p> Unfortunately, most people assume the opposite.  Some would be highly embarrassed if they knew the error of their assumptions.  For example, our family makes regular contributions to a particular missionary organization.  Each year, my wife Diane, writes, signs and mails the check.  Yet, I get a personal thank-you card annually addressed to me and written to me alone.  We are grateful that a key leader takes the time to write a personal thank you.  Unfortunately, every year it's obvious that he believes I have written the check.  At first it was humorous, but over the years it's become annoying.</p><p> It's not just non-business people who make these mistakes.  I have had financial advisers send just me notes and cards when they knew it was a joint account with Diane. Unfortunately, these missteps are too common.  The female advisers I have spoken to are frequently approached by women clients who've had bad experiences with male advisers.  Unfortunately, there is nothing in financial services training that teaches advisers how to deal with the human side of the business.  This lack of relationship training has a negative impact on the bottom line. </p><p> So what? Because of this fact some professional sales and service providers might be sadly mistaken and rather embarrassed if they continue to think that I (the man) make all the investment decisions. The data says otherwise. I have heard many stories from financial professionals of when this assumption has occurred. It's embarrassing for the sales professional and I am convinced in many cases, unintentional.  There certainly are sins of omission and sins of commission, but the bottom line is that ignorance can no longer cover this drastic oversight.</p><p> I'm here to tell you that my wife and I are not unique. The data is clear and getting stronger that the American female is currently controlling the assets both in the family and independently. It's not just purchasing power - we already know that to be true. But rather the investable assets she controls represents the majority of wealth in the U.S. for the first time. According the U.S. Census Bureau, <strong>  American women control 53 percent of all investable assets, which is roughly $14 trillion. </strong></p><p> Moreover, today there are more women working than men and more women are graduating from U.S. colleges than men. In addition, due to higher life expectancies for women over men and higher divorce rates, more single women are controlling wealth in their senior years than ever before.</p><p> What does this mean for you the wealth sales and service professional?  Perhaps more pointedly, what does it mean for the male financial professional? Today in the financial services industry, <strong>  female advisers make up less than 20% of the registered professionals. </strong>   I think it means we (as an industry) may need to change our game plan. Generally speaking (and I add with great caution to a delicate topic) male advisers either have not seen the data that supports this new world financial leader or don't know what to do about her -- or perhaps both. If that's the case, this is your chance to understand the opportunity, challenges and positive outcomes in store for you-that is if you can change old paradigms and prepare to genuinely and effectively serve the female client in a meaningful way. Perhaps it's time for a new perspective.</p><p> Think about this data:</p><p> <strong>  -Women will inherit 70% of the $41 trillion in the intergenerational wealth transfer expected over the next 40 years </strong></p><p> <strong>  -If a woman reaches her 50th birthday without cancer or heart disease, she can expect to live to age 92 </strong></p><p> <strong>  -74% of women are single when they pass away </strong></p><p> <strong>  -75% of caretakers of elderly family members are women </strong></p><p> Consider this word picture. Working almost exclusively with the man in the joint accounts you manage is like creating a football game plan to win by building your entire game plan around the New England Patriots quarterback, Tom Brady. You may think you have created a winning financial wealth and life game plan to be in position to win with Brady (it certainly seems easy with him) but the fact is, he will not even be in the game for the fourth and final quarter. You will have to win without Tom Brady. Why?  Because he will be dead (statistically). The quarterback of the family wealth in the final quarter will be Mrs. Brady, and you better hope that she thinks you care for her and have her best interests in mind.  The data today indicates she doesn't believe that you do! As a matter of fact, she does not think our industry has her best interests in mind. </p><p> So, how can you rethink your strategy?  The following comes from the book The $14 Trillion Woman (BookSurge, 2009) and are three quick actions you can take now:</p><p> <strong>  1.  Change the language you use and the audiences you use it with.  Speak straightforwardly and honestly to the female client. Remove jargon. Address her, look her in the eyes and watch your body language. Transparency builds trust. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2.  Consider adding a female wealth professional or assistant to your team who may be better positioned to solicit the trust and confidence of the female client and prospect. </strong></p><p> <strong>  3.  Spend time determining what specific female client/prospect you want to focus on.  Is it the young professional?  Divorcees? Widows? Seniors?  Be sure you have put the proper work into who your ideal female client is. </strong></p><p> Be open to the possibility that this opportunity, if addressed with seriousness and genuineness, may change your production forever.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Most business professionals have figured out that a LinkedIn account is a required tool in the digital age. But far fewer people have a clear idea of what they should be doing with it.</p><p> For me, it all comes down to this: <strong>  LinkedIn is for good, old-fashioned networking. </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s for expanding your network and touching base with the people that are already part of it. It&rsquo;s for helping people find solutions to their problems and to expand their networks. And <strong>  it&rsquo;s for nurturing relationships and getting to know people better. </strong></p><p> Beware of people that complicate LinkedIn in order to demonstrate their expertise or sell you something you really don&rsquo;t need. If you&rsquo;re in business and you&rsquo;ve had any success, you know how to build a network. You know how to have business relationships. You know how to help people.</p><p> <strong>  LinkedIn is a tool for cultivating one of your most valuable assets in business: your social network. </strong></p><p> So, here&rsquo;s what you should be doing on LinkedIn:</p><h3> 1. Complete your profile.</h3><p> Write a summary in the first person that describes your essence and include the keywords for which you want to be found. Your profile is your calling card. People will search LinkedIn and you want them to find YOU. Tip: Invest in a warm and friendly headshot because people judge you based on appearances.</p><h3> 2. Connect with everyone.</h3><p> If you meet anyone in real life and have a meaningful interaction of any kind, then add that person as a LinkedIn connection. You want to build a big network, an audience. Think of concentric circles expanding out from you. Tip: Always personalize your invitations to connect, mentioning something that ties you to that person.</p><h3> 3. Pay attention to your feed.</h3><p> At least once per day, you should look at your LinkedIn feed and like some posts, comment on others and share the best ones with your network. You get what you give. Tip: People pay more attention to people that pay attention to them.</p><h3> 4. Share great content.</h3><p> Sharing great articles, videos and graphics in your feed at least once each day (but preferably 2 or 3 times) is the best way to be visible in your network. You always want to be the bearer of helpful information. Tip: Go to LinkedIn &gt; Interests &gt; Pulse to find great content to share.</p><h3> 5. Write insightful and personal articles.</h3><p> Use LinkedIn&rsquo;s publishing capabilities to write and share an article of your own at least once a month. You need to show people how you think, what you&rsquo;re made of. Tip: Avoid marketing and self-promotional language and focus on sharing personal perspectives, insights and passions in a professionally appropriate way.</p><p> Focus on doing these five things and consistently try to give value and be helpful to your network and you will find that LinkedIn &ndash; your network &ndash; gives back too.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cinsight\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Eric Stahler  </u> </a> | <u>  Corporate Insight </u>  </p><p> The brokerage industry is still abuzz from the recent release of Schwab&rsquo;s Intelligent Portfolios, as competitors search for ways to regain their footing in the rapidly changing marketplace. This past month, in the latest retaliation to Schwab&rsquo;s entry into the robo-advising sector, Wealthfront and Betterment both introduced tax-loss harvesting services to all account holders at no additional cost. Tax-loss harvesting &ndash; the practice of selling a security at a loss to defer capital gain taxes &ndash; was traditionally reserved for high-net-worth investors who could afford to pay advisors for the laborious process. In recent years, however, automated investment firms have attempted to reverse the exclusivity of the practice, opening it up to less affluent investors, by computerizing the process with algorithm-based technology. Robo-advising firms aim to revolutionize the brokerage practice, and Betterment and Wealthfront&rsquo;s recent actions exemplify the larger trends within the industry.</p><p> <img alt=\"Betterments_Announcement_of_New_Tax_Loss\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/55706/hubfs/CI_Blog/Screenshots/Betterments_Announcement_of_New_Tax_Loss.png?t=1432055283881&amp;width=441\"/></p><p> Betterment&rsquo;s Announcement of New Tax Loss Harvesting+ Program</p><p> Betterment and Wealthfront&rsquo;s tax-loss harvesting services, which are available with no minimum balance, are likely to attract less affluent investors who are eager to boost returns on their portfolios. Previously, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150325/FREE/150329956/take-that-schwab-wealthfront-to-expand-free-tax-loss-harvesting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   lowest account minimum  </a> </u> , maintained by FutureAdvisor, was a hefty $30,000. Both firms claim that their computer-generated solutions, which analyze portfolios on a daily basis for tax saving opportunities, can help clients amass as much as  <u>  1-3% in annual returns </u> . However, many in the brokerage industry question the benefits for those with lower account balances. Critics maintain that tax-loss harvesting will not be as profitable to less wealthy individuals who do not bear as much tax risk. Arguably, tax-loss harvesting has historically been preserved for the ultra-wealthy because the method requires a large investment to generate significant returns.  </p><p> <img alt=\"Wealthfronts_Slideshow_Promoting_New_Tax_Loss_Service\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/55706/hubfs/CI_Blog/Screenshots/Wealthfronts_Slideshow_Promoting_New_Tax_Loss_Service.png?t=1432055283881&amp;width=424\"/></p><p> Wealthfront&rsquo;s Slideshow Promoting New Tax Loss Harvesting Service</p><p> Regardless of the monetary impact that tax-loss services may have on less affluent investors, Betterment and Wealthfront&rsquo;s actions reveal the shifting landscape of the robo-advising spectrum. Since Schwab sent shockwaves across the industry with the launch of its Intelligent Portfolios, competitors have been on the offensive to undercut the firm&rsquo;s momentum. However, Intelligent Portfolios does not appear to be losing any steam, having already  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/2015/04/24/schwabs-robo-service-nets-1-5-billion-in-six-weeks/?mod=mktw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   accumulated over $1.5 billion  </a> </u>  in assets in just a couple of months. In order to compete with Schwab&rsquo;s vast resources and established reputation, smaller robo-advisor firms must get creative to maintain the services of existing clients and attract the business of prospects. In this respect, it appears that Betterment and Wealthfront&rsquo;s expansion of tax-loss harvesting services is, more than anything, a thinly veiled counterattack on Schwab&rsquo;s spreading industry presence.</p><p> It will not end here. The growing competitiveness of the robo-advising industry is forcing firms to increase their offerings continually just to stay afloat. The larger question remains: how far will firms go in the battle to gain investors before overextending themselves or overestimating the benefit of their services to clients? Only time will tell, but if the future of the robo-advising industry becomes a game of &ldquo;last man standing,&rdquo; the cards are clearly stacked in Schwab&rsquo;s favor.</p>",

    "link": "select-the-right-document-management-system-dms-for-your-firm-part-1",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Your firm has decided that implementing an electronic document management system&mdash;or, if it also includes the ability to  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/solutions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   automate business processes  </u> </a> , an enterprise content management (ECM) system&mdash;will help lower costs and increase productivity. However, with so many different ECM and document management systems out there, it can be hard to select the right one for you.</p><p> Here are three questions you need to answer before you even begin to look at the document management and ECM systems on the market:</p><h3> 1. What are your firm&rsquo;s goals for the document management or ECM implementation?</h3><p> <br/> This is an important question to answer because you need to know what you want to achieve before you can identify the functionality that your new document management or ECM system must contain. A few of the most common goals for implementing a document management or ECM system include:</p><li> Efficiently capture information and automate classification, eliminating the need for manual sorting and processing.</li><li> Securely and efficiently search, retrieve, scan, store, email, and manage multiple types of content, including but not limited to electronic and imaged documents, emails and audio-visual files.</li><li> Automate content-related business processes such as case management, contract management or accounts payable processing.</li><li> Archive records and apply formal retention schedules for effective information governance. <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Do you want your document management or ECM system to integrate with the other software applications your firm already uses?</h3><p> <br/> Although document management/ECM can be used as a standalone system, it has the most impact when it can be tied to existing applications, allowing staff to access the document repository through their primary systems (e.g. ERP, EMR or CRM). For example:</p><li> Wealth Enhancement Group, a Minnesota-based financial planning and advisory services firm with locations throughout the upper Midwest, has  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/SolutionExchange/integrate-laserfiche-and-junxure-with-advice-from-wealth-enhancement-group-llc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   integrated ECM with its Junxure CRM system  </u> </a>  to improve client service, decrease paper usage and accelerate audits.</li><li> Hanson McClain, an independent investment advisory firm headquartered in Sacramento, has <u>  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/casestudy/hanson-mcclain/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   integrated ECM with DocuSign, LaserApp and its CRM system  </a> </u> to automate their client onboarding process.</li><li> Virginia-based Palladium Registered Investment Advisors has <u>  integrated ECM with its portfolio management software </u> to accelerate and improve new account opening. <br/>  </li><p> If integration is important to your firm, you must ensure that the systems you evaluate have an open architecture, and that the vendors you are evaluating have experience with the type of integrations you will require.</p><h3> 3. How much in-house document management expertise do you have, and how much do you need to cultivate?</h3><p> <br/> A document management or ECM system can dramatically improve your firm&rsquo;s information management and business productivity, but too many systems demand extensive domain expertise from expensive programmers, analysts and consultants. By looking for a system that fosters individual knowledge and expertise through the use of prepackaged code, active developer and support forums, downloadable templates, preconfigured workflow activities and an active user community, firms eliminate the need to rely on outside experts.</p><p> To learn more about how to evaluate a document management system, download your copy of &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://ecm.laserfiche.com/document-management/?utm_source=iris.localhost.lan&amp;utm_medium=ad-digital&amp;utm_campaign=5%2F19%2F2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Document Management: The Buyer&rsquo;s Handbook  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meridithpowell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Meridith Elliott Powell  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.meridithelliottpowell.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   MERIDITH ELLIOTT POWELL  </u> </a>  </p><p> I was out to dinner with a client when her phone rang. She apologetically excused herself and got up to take the call. We were at the new hot spot in town: a trendy and, at this moment, very crowded restaurant. Not wanting to endure a two-hour wait for a table, we grabbed a seat in the bar at one of those community tables&mdash;you know the ones: long seats that fit about 20 strangers with a respectfully empty chair between each party.</p><p> When my client stepped outside, I took my phone out and pretended to read emails, but in reality I was eavesdropping on the conversation going on between the couple seated next to me. I felt a bit ashamed but couldn&rsquo;t help it! The gentleman was talking so loudly that it was difficult to politely tune him out. It became pretty clear that they were on a first date because the loud conversational content was all getting-to-know-you questions and answers.</p><p> <strong>  During their first cocktail, things seemed to be going quite well. </strong>  He was handsome and humorous, telling stories, and she was laughing and engaged, hanging on his every word. Just as the chemistry was heating up, I had to tune out because my client returned and we needed to get down to business.</p><p> As luck would have it, my client had to take another call, so I tuned back in to the couple&rsquo;s conversation. At this point, things looked like they were getting better by the moment. He had moved his chair next to hers and the couple sat side by side.  <strong>  But as I kept listening, it became clear that things had actually started going downhill. </strong>  The conversation had shifted from an even exchange to a one-sided monologue with Mr. Right dominating.  <strong>  Instead of sticking with light, fun, friendly topics, the gentleman had started opening up to his date about his last big breakup. </strong></p><p> <strong>  The more he talked about himself, the needier he sounded and the less interested his date became. </strong>  By the time my client came back from her call, the sad gentleman&rsquo;s date had gotten up from the table and walked out. Now, I obviously don&rsquo;t know the entire story about why she left and what her exact reason was, but I do know that my unfortunate friend ordered another cocktail and settled in for a long night alone with a forlorn look on his face.</p><p> As any motivational speaker will tell you,  <strong>  real life offers the examples of what to and what not to do when building relationships </strong> , both personally and professionally. As I thought back on the unsuccessful gentleman later, I started analyzing where the date went wrong. My observations provided some great insight for hopeful daters and sales professionals alike. Failed calls often start out strong, with the salesperson making great contact and building rapport, but just like a bad first date,  <strong>  when the salesperson begins dominating the conversation or revealing too much too soon, the client loses interest. </strong></p><p> Why was the date unsuccessful, and why does the same strategy fail in sales?  <strong>  In order to win the other party over at the beginning of a relationship, the focus needs to be on them, not you.  </strong> Additionally, while long-term transparency and honesty are the cornerstones of sustainable relationships, revealing too much, too fast can paint you as desperate and needy.  <strong>  Clients choose professionals and organizations that are assured and confident, especially in this economy. </strong></p><h3> 5 Strategies To Get You the Second Date</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Get To Know Them </strong>  &ndash; Clients choose and stay with your business because they know, like and trust you. At its core,  <strong>  buying is an emotional decision. The challenge comes from assuming that to get to know others we need to tell them about ourselves, when in reality this method fails time after time. </strong>  The best way to get to know people is by asking questions, listening to them, and relating things about you that fit into their personal story. In other words, find a common ground. Our clients&mdash;and people in general&mdash;are interested in one thing: themselves.</p><p> <strong>  2. Stay Focused </strong>  &ndash; On the client, that is. At the beginning of any relationship  <strong>  you stand a much better chance of getting a second &ldquo;date&rdquo; if you spend 20% of your time talking about yourself and 80% talking about them. </strong>  The gentleman at the restaurant was doing really well in the beginning, but the longer the conversation went on the less he focused on his date and the more he focused on himself.  <strong>  Even if the client asks questions about you, stay focused! </strong>  Give a great answer and then return the focus of the conversation to the client.</p><p> <strong>  3. Be Aware &ndash; Customers (and dates) communicate much more with their eyes and body language than they do with their mouths </strong> ; pay attention to the physical messages they are sending. My poor friend at the restaurant was completely oblivious to the subtle signals his date was offering him.  <strong>  As she lost interest, she started diverting her gaze and looking around, folded her arms, and sighed a little, attempting to gently cue him in that she was losing interest. </strong>  Unfortunately, he was so focused on himself that he missed these subtle but clear signs. Be aware of these physical signals; they can help you gauge your client&rsquo;s level of interest.</p><p> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t Cave &ndash; No matter how much a client asks you about yourself and how tempting it is to do so, don&rsquo;t cave. </strong>  In fairness to the gentleman at the restaurant, his date kept asking questions out of politeness, and in part because of this he missed the signs, opportunities and clues telling him to turn the conversation back to her. In other words, he took the bait.  <strong>  No matter how much people ask you about you, they secretly hope that you will find them so interesting that you will turn the focus of conversation back to them over and over. </strong></p><p> <strong>  5. Keep It Light </strong>  &ndash; This is a first call (or a first date), after all, so keep it light. You are not there to learn every deep, dark need of your client&rsquo;s&ndash;you will have plenty of time to deepen your understanding of them as the relationship grows. As my unfortunate friend learned the hard way, your date or client does not need or want to know everything about you up front, nor do they necessarily want to reveal everything about themselves right away. Keep the first meeting light: ask questions, laugh and enjoy the conversation. Then be patient; give the relationship time, allowing the client to set the pace.</p>",

Therefore, it is absolutely essential that you take measures to safeguard your identity when you are moving. Make sure to follow these best practices to keep your identity safe when you move.</p><h3> Hire Trustworthy Help</h3><p> <br/> Though it might sound cheesy, it is true that a little preparation ahead of time can avoid a lot of stress later. Fully licensed and insured  <a href=\"https://www.unpakt.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  moving companies </a>  need to be screened and compared to the other available options. Using Unpakt can make it simpler to compare moving prices by allowing you to view the number of years a company has been in business, their online reviews and the costs involved with their services. The moving companies that you consider should have a plan that is customized for your belongings and your move. Be sure that they are aware of all the details and are transparent about costs. An easy negotiation and airtight contract is the mark of true professionals.</p><h3> Keep Personal Information in a Safe Place</h3><p> <br/> When going through belongings and especially your personal documents, keep your eyes open for items that have your date of birth, driver&rsquo;s license number or social security number included. Be sure that these things are put away in a very safe place (perhaps a safe or locking file cabinet that you will transport in your vehicle). Keep a shredder handy and use it liberally when you are packing.</p><h3> Get Your Mail Transferred Immediately</h3><p> <br/> Some people are overwhelmed with the moving process and slack off when it comes to handling these details. That can be a big mistake! Be sure to change your address with your post office, employer, bank, credit card and loan companies. You do not want your personal information sitting in someone else&rsquo;s mailbox.</p><h3> Use Common Sense</h3><p> <br/> As always, be careful with personally identifying information. Do not share your social security number, credit card numbers, or other pertinent data by phone unless you are completely certain of who you are giving that information to. When applying for new utilities, an apartment or a new mortgage, the same rule applies. Know who is requesting your information and why they need it. You might find that in some cases, it is not really necessary at all. The less this info is shared, the safer it is.</p><h3> Review Your Credit Cards</h3><p> <br/> If you don&rsquo;t already, reviewing each of your credit cards the month or so after your move is an excellent idea. Look for any newly opened accounts or inquiries that you do not recognize. Catching identity theft early is very important. If you see any issues, take action immediately.</p><p> Following these simple steps will help to keep your identity protected when you are moving.

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;My PR team isn&rsquo;t getting me results.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Social media doesn&rsquo;t work for my business.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;My print ads don&rsquo;t give me a return on my investment.&rdquo;</p><p> We hear these and similar statements regularly.</p><p> Many business owners are looking for a magic pill that cures the ailment and wonder why individual, one-off campaigns and tactics don&rsquo;t deliver the goods. The harsh reality is that not only is there no single magic pill, but there really is only one prescription for a business looking to grow and that is to start with a brand strategy.</p><p> Building a brand strategy is the foundational work that inspires and informs every subsequent activity in a business from hiring to product development, marketing, sales and more. We wouldn&rsquo;t build a house without a secure foundation, yet business owners often build their walls without a thought given to the quicksand they&rsquo;re building on. Rather than hoping for the individual campaigns to create your strategy (hint: that never works), the only proven way to business growth is by starting with the strategy. Where I come from, we like to say that you need the map BEFORE you enter the woods. Business is no different.</p><p> While a brand strategy for a company can run to 100 pages or more (it can also start on the back of a napkin), I&rsquo;ll do my best to summarize its most important points here.</p><h3> Key Elements of a Brand Strategy</h3><p> <br/> A brand strategy (irrespective of the company or industry) always follows the same rules and intention. It is the how, what, when, and to whom you plan on communicating your product or service, aligned with your company goals.</p><li> It should start with your own  <strong>  beliefs </strong> : &ldquo;As a company we believe that x, y, z&hellip;..&rdquo;.</li><li> It should contain your values. Those  <strong>  values </strong>  will normally stem from your beliefs.</li><li> To truly allow your organization to execute with precision on your beliefs and reach your goals, the brand strategy must contain your  <strong>  <u>   Unified Vision  </u> </strong> , which is a vision for the next, 5, 10, 20 years of your company in terms of company goals aligned with your previously stated beliefs.</li><li> Next you&rsquo;ll want to list your <strong>   differentiators </strong> . What truly sets you apart from your competition? Can you prove that you are truly unique in these areas?</li><li> Finally, define your  <strong>  target audience </strong> . What does your ideal customer look like? What is their demographic? What do they read? Where do they live? The more customer insights you can glean, the greater the chances of success. <br/>  </li><p> These are the key areas of building a brand strategy. Once such an exercise has been completed in your company, the output should be a document that is signed off on by leadership and then shared internally as the official direction and positioning document of the company. Companies that scale efficiently follow their brand strategy with dedication. While it can&rsquo;t predict every direction your business may take, it should inform decision making in every area of the business such as HR, PR, marketing, sales, etc. Now you&rsquo;ll have a much better chance of success with PR, social media campaigns, print media and more because your goals will be aligned, your audience defined and your strategy clear.</p>",

    "link": "legal-marijuana-and-life-insurance",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pennmutual\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Gretchen Dinucci  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://blog.pennmutual.com/penn-mutual/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Penn Mutual  </u> </a> As of today, 23 states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form. Colorado, Washington, Washington D.C., and now Alaska and Oregon have also approved recreational use. Legalization might have been unthinkable a generation ago, but the world changes, and we must change with it. So, how should the life insurance industry respond to legalized marijuana? Does using marijuana make someone a poor insurance risk? As chief underwriter for Penn Mutual, it is my job to understand how changes like legalizing marijuana affect our business.Penn Mutual has not yet set out a position on legalized marijuana, but here are some of the things we might consider as we establish our criteria.</p><h3> Health Risks of Marijuana</h3>Just because it&rsquo;s now legal doesn&rsquo;t absolve people from the health impacts of marijuana use. Smoking tobacco is legal, but we all understand the profound health risks involved, something that is reflected in the premiums charged for life insurance.Marijuana use is not without its share of <a href=\"http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana\" target=\"_blank\"> health risks</a>. For example, evidence indicates that long-term use can lead to addiction or dependency according to the criteria for dependence in the <a href=\"http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/dsm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>.<h3> Context and Frequency</h3>Every insurance company is different, each with their own underwriting guidelines, but in general insurance underwriters want to look at the whole person and not just one specific issue. Using marijuana would just be another factor to consider and underwriters would want to know a bit more about the context. Is the use purely recreational? Is it being used for medicinal purposes? How often is the person using it? Does it affect the person&rsquo;s ability to hold a job? Have they been treated for drug abuse? Have there been any motor vehicle related issues?<h3> Medical Use of Marijuana</h3>Many people are using marijuana for medical purposes. There&rsquo;s been research that shows that marijuana helps with glaucoma, nausea, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and other medical problems. From an insurance perspective, this brings up a whole new set of issues. If someone is using marijuana to alleviate the nausea stemming from chemotherapy, underwriters are likely to be much more concerned about the impact of the cancer on the risk assessment than about the marijuana use.<h3> Smoking versus Ingesting Marijuana</h3>There is a movement away from the smoking of marijuana toward ingestion of it in candy or food. However there are risks from the marijuana even if ingested. For example, edibles have been associated with overdose.Testing for Marijuana Use. The test for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is very specific to marijuana. Most insurance companies don&rsquo;t routinely test for it, but there are some that do. It just depends on the insurance carrier, their comfort and experience levels and their willingness to pay for the test.<h3> Misrepresentation on the Application for Insurance</h3>If someone is using marijuana, they should be truthful about it when they apply for insurance. If their insurance carrier learns of an un-admitted medical history and determines misrepresentation occurred, there could be adverse impacts to the life insurance policy such as rescission or denial of a death claim.We understand the sensitive nature of asking an applicant about drug or alcohol use; however, these are risk factors that must be considered. We protect confidential medical information throughout the underwriting process under HIPAA laws.<h3> Federal Law.</h3>Finally, while a few states have legalized marijuana, the Federal government still considers it illegal, and it is the Federal government that runs the banking system. People are finding it difficult to put the profits from their marijuana dispensaries into a U.S. bank. Selling marijuana is currently an all-cash business, and if an insurance company accepts money from such a business to fund an insurance policy, it could potentially be in violation of Federal money-laundering laws.At this point, it is unclear how the life insurance industry will handle legalized marijuana. In some ways, it depends on how society as a whole approaches marijuana. If a broad portion of the people applying for insurance are using legal marijuana, then the underwriting and pricing of our policies would obviously need to reflect that shift. We, as an industry, always need to stay on top of changes in society, in laws, and in underwriting best practices.Underwriting is about determining risk, and we don&rsquo;t look at one factor and give that factor significant weight over the other factors. Underwriters look at the complete profile of the applicant &mdash; their height and weight, their driving record, their lab work, statements from their physicians, and any hazardous activity &mdash; flying planes, scuba diving, things of that sort. Marijuana use, legal or otherwise, is just one factor among many to consider.",

    "content": "<p> Can something as simple as height explain women's lower earning power? <br/> <br/> It's funny how, in the space of 20 years or so, \"height research\" has gone from an oddball, poorly respected area of research to a fully legitimate, active branch of the larger field of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=anthropometry&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8\" target=\"_blank\">   anthropometry  </a> </u> . People who work in this area study things like how population height varies over time, how body height varies with respect to things like income or mortality, etc. Some pretty interesting facts have come to light. <br/> <br/> For example, there is absolutely no doubt any more that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.timothy-judge.com/Height%20paper--JAP%20published.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   height predicts your lifetime earning potential  </a> </u> . Dozens of studies (and meta-analyses: studies of studies) show that tall people earn more, your height at age 16 predicts future earnings, every extra inch of height means $789/yr more salary (U.S.), 90% of CEOs are above-average height, etc., and also the income of a nation predicts the height of its people: <br/>  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cqe5xpMflLU/VVingbWBVrI/AAAAAAAADrc/8Y5ETdnZQtw/s1600/correlation-between-log-income-per-capita-and-height-baten-blum-20120-645x467.png\"/></p><p> It's also well established that Europeans are now taller than Americans, and that (in fact)  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/04/05/the-height-gap?currentPage=all\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Americans not only stopped growing taller 30 years ago, they've actually been shrinking, and U.S. women are shrinking faster than men  </a> </u> .</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-peaQwBagjv4/VVipqZJlR4I/AAAAAAAADro/DJ9LGNukFIs/s1600/historical-median-male-height.png\"/></p><p> The median Dutch woman of today is taller than the median Dutch man of 100 years ago. But the median U.S. woman is only a couple millimeters taller today than the U.S. woman of 100 years ago; women in the U.S. have come full circle. <br/> <br/> Note: A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that about 39% of the gender pay differential in the U.S. can be explained by height alone. Women in the U.S. are now about 5 inches shorter than men. The \"height advantage\" in pay is $789 per year per inch. That's almost $4000 less, per year, for women. The median per capita income difference between U.S. men and women is about $10K per year. QED. <br/> <br/> A huge amount of research has been done correlating height with income (I won't repeat it here) and lately it's become fashionable to do all kinds of research on income inequality (I'm reading Piketty's  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067443000X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=067443000X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=asse0a-20&amp;linkId=6N7RGBLHXN4XO4Z4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Capital  </a> </u>  now; an essential book for understanding inequality), so I naturally assumed that someone, by now, has surely looked at height versus income inequality. But surprisingly, I could find nothing in the recent literature. <br/> <br/> However, I did stumble onto a fantastic bit of citizen science on this subject. A blogger at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bball.ninja/?p=11\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   bbninja.com  </a> </u>  has obtained  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height#Average_height_around_the_world\" target=\"_blank\">   height data for about 60 countries  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_distribution_of_wealth\" target=\"_blank\">   wealth inequality data for those same countries  </a> </u>  (\"Wealth Gini\" data), and plotted the data. The graph for men looks like this:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QRwwJKoj-PA/VVismlCgJWI/AAAAAAAADr0/9xDhVsZSVto/s1600/world_income_inequality_and_male_height-1024x553.png\"/></p><p> What we see is just what I would have predicted, which is that there is a definite inverse correlation (R=0.415) between body height and income inequality. Wherever income inequality is greater, men tend to be shorter. (The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bball.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/world_income_inequality_and_female_height-1024x553.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   graph for females  </a> </u>  is virtually identical.) This is somewhat counterintuitive inasmuch as high-Gini countries tend, also, to be rich countries. We know that rich countries have taller people. But that only makes the above graph more believable, in my opinion. Inequality is not simply a proxy for income. <br/> <br/> The correlation is not super-strong, because so many factors go into determining how tall you become. We wouldn't expect Gini coefficient to explain very much of a person's height, and indeed it doesn't (the R-squared value above means it explains, at most, about 17% of height differences). Still, it's a superb result and deserves to be published (or made into a dissertation). <br/> <br/> Some enterprising grad student should seize on these results and pursue the matter further, perhaps (for example) determining, numerically, the degree to which income inequality (or other factors) account for the height difference between men and women. It's likely to be a small degree, obviously, because we \"know\" the gender height differential is biological. But do we know that? No specific biochemical or molecular-genetic mechanism has ever been offered for the height difference between males and females. We know of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/272382.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one gene  </a> </u>  on the X chromosome that (when overexpressed, in females) accounts for 1% of the height difference between the sexes, in humans. Aside from that, it's not known how women end up shorter (since they have essentially the same genes as men, differing only in having two copies of the X chromosome). Tip: It's not a simple matter of hormones. Women actually make several times more pituitary growth hormone than men. <br/> <br/> So if you're a grad student in biology, please work on explaining in detailed molecular terms how women end up shorter (this is still very much an open question); and if you're a grad student in sociology, please work on explaining the degree to which sociological factors (access to health care, access to nutrition, access to wealth, exposure to poverty, etc.) make women end up shorter. </p>",

    "content": "<h3> The Beatles sold over one billion records and forever changed the face of pop music.</h3><p> <br/> As a team, they were able to create a whole that was greater than the sum of the parts. Together, they composed better music than they ever could have or did as solo artists. What did they do to accomplish this, in addition to simply being natural-born songwriting geniuses?</p><p> For many years I&rsquo;ve taught a workshop based on how the Beatles worked together, wrote their chart-topping songs, and built the biggest global fan base of any musical act in history (read: built their &ldquo;client base.&rdquo;). This was articulated in a popular article I wrote in strategy+business called the Beatles Principles, which apparently was one of their two most popular articles that year.</p><p> Who doesn&rsquo;t love the Beatles? A friend of mine, the CEO of his own company, once interviewed an executive candidate for a senior role. During the interview, he learned&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask me how&mdash;that the man disliked Beatles songs. My friend categorically rejected him for the job, telling me, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just something wrong with someone who doesn&rsquo;t like Beatles&rsquo; music!&rdquo;</p><p> Last February was the 50th anniversary of the Beatles&rsquo; arrival in the USA. On February 9th, 1964, the largest TV audience in history at the time&mdash;and still the second largest as a percentage of the US population&mdash;watched their performance on the Ed Sullivan Show.  72 million Americans. My whole family was watching&mdash;I was 9 years old at the time.</p><h3> Here are five of my Beatles principles that will help you grow your own business and client base:</h3><h3> Principle 1: Create Face Time </h3><p> <br/> When the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan show in early 1964, they seemed like an overnight success. But in fact three or the four Beatles had met in 1957, and by the time of their historic appearance they had spent thousands of hours playing together in clubs in the UK and Germany, honing their act. Over 1000 hours on stage together in Hamburg&rsquo;s clubs. 293 shows at the Cavern Club in Liverpool. And so on. Face time builds likeability, rapport, and trust.</p><li> If you want to do a great &ldquo;live&rdquo; performance in front of a client, you need to invest in prior face time with your colleagues. Correspondingly, you need face time with clients themselves&mdash;just as the Beatles spent years doing live performances before retreating to the recording studio in 1966. <br/>  </li><h3> Principle 2: Evolve Your Songs</h3><p> <br/> Every new record the Beatles released represented a dramatic evolution of their music, and as a result their fan base grew ever larger. They explored new themes, musical styles, unorthodox instruments (e.g., the Sitar), and new arrangements, producing an extraordinary variety of songs. The band also managed to embrace and integrate each member&rsquo;s unique musical interests into their recordings. Just look at the leap from &ldquo;I Want to Hold Your Hand&rdquo; (1963) to &ldquo;Eleanor Rigby&rdquo; (1965). The range and variety of Beatles&rsquo; songs is astonishing. Most groups pump out the same stuff, year after year. Not the Fab Four.</p><li> If you want to keep your clients for life, you can&rsquo;t sing &ldquo;I Want to Hold Your Hand&rdquo; to them year after year. You have to evolve your songs and bring them new ideas, perspectives, and points of view. <br/>  </li><h3> Principle 3: Build brands within a Brand</h3><p> <br/> The Beatles were never a lead singer with a backing band but rather an ensemble of four equal (at least publicly) musicians. As a group they were a world-renowned brand, but each individual Beatle also had a public persona and reputation. They worked at this: On almost every Beatles record, for example, John and Paul wrote a song for Ringo to perform, so that he could have his own platform with the public.</p><p> If you doubt me, here&rsquo;s a quiz: How many members of the Rolling Stones can you name? How many Beatles can you name? Do you see my point? Generally, I have found that only 5% of a large audience can name all the Rolling Stones, whereas 95% can name each of the Beatles.</p><li> You can&rsquo;t sit back and coast on your company&rsquo;s brand. You must build your OWN brand in the marketplace&mdash;your own renown as a leading expert in your field. The two&mdash;company brand and individual brand&mdash;work together. The company brand gets you into the RFPs. The individual brand gets you sole source work. <br/>  </li><h3> Principle 4: Put Opposites Together to Spur Creativity.</h3><p> <br/> John Lennon and Paul McCartney together wrote most of the Beatles songs, and you could not have found two individuals who had a more different temperament and character. Paul was optimistic, a perfectionist, and loved the Beatles&rsquo; fame; John was equally creative but also cynical and angry, and he grew to hate their notoriety. Their strengths and weaknesses were complementary, often creating sparks, but the result is the most valuable song catalog in the world. Paul&rsquo;s lightness tempered John&rsquo;s darkness, and John&rsquo;s more cynical, dark view of the world complemented Paul&rsquo;s upbeat love songs. Listen to &ldquo;Getting Better&rdquo; on Sgt. Peppers: As Paul sings &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting better all the time&rdquo; you can hear John in the background singing, in a kind of depressed voice, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get much worse&rdquo;!</p><li> When you put teams together, intentionally create diversity in terms of people with different experiences, backgrounds, temperaments, and so on. The most creative teams are the most diverse ones. Yet, studies show we tend to ask people just like ourselves to be on our teams! <br/>  </li><h3> Principle 5: All-for-one, one-for-all compensation is an important driver of creativity and collaboration.</h3><p> <br/> Early on, John Lennon suggested to Paul that they credit all the songs they wrote&mdash;together or even separately&mdash;as &ldquo;Lennon/McCartney.&rdquo; This meant they would share the royalties 50-50 as well. So, no matter how much or how little one of them contributed to the other&rsquo;s songs, the compensation was the same. While Paul has since complained about that arrangement with regard to certain songs&mdash;notably &ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; which is one of the most popular songs in history&mdash;I believe it cemented their intense, personal collaboration. No one had to worry about how much compensation they would get for chipping in a few lyrics or a bridge to a song the other had written. The 50-50 agreement took away any financial barriers to creative collaboration.</p><li> Don&rsquo;t overcomplicate compensation. People don&rsquo;t collaborate because they are paid to&mdash;they collaborate because they share common goals, like and trust each other, and are not being pushed into highly individualist behavior by overly-engineered monetary incentives. Measurements and rewards can easily divide people. Focus on creating a rising tide that lifts all boats. <br/>  </li><p> So go forth, listen to a few of your favorite Beatles songs, and then implement these principles.

    "content": "<p> Employee retention for the millennial generation is notoriously low, and turnover can cost a company a great deal. Clearly it&rsquo;s a problem that needs a solution. To keep millennials engaged, you have to appeal to their unique entrepreneurial spirit &mdash; something you didn&rsquo;t have to worry about with older generations like the baby boomers.</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.creativelive.com/creative-jobs-report/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Creative Live  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.rasmussen.edu/student-experience/college-life/millennials-in-the-workplace/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rasmussen College  </a> </u>  surveys:</p><li> 67% of millennial employees surveyed would exit their jobs for a more creative, self-employed track</li><li> 60% of millennials consider themselves entrepreneurs</li><li> 90% of millennials think of &ldquo;entrepreneurship&rdquo; not as starting your own business but as having a &ldquo;risk-taking&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-starting mindset&rdquo; of someone who &ldquo;spots opportunity&rdquo;</li><p> Though the first statistic may scare more traditional companies, there is good news here: millennials&rsquo; definition of the word means that they can find entrepreneur opportunities within a more traditional job environment &mdash; meaning you have an opportunity to boost millennial employee retention. It&rsquo;s just up to leaders within that organization to foster that entrepreneur spirit.</p><h3> Leave Time for Passion Projects</h3><p> As always, Google seems to be ahead of the game when it comes to satisfying millennial employees. Borrow an idea from Google&rsquo;s \"20% time\" program. Within the organizational culture of Google, all employees are not only allowed but encouraged to use 20% of their time to dream up new projects or take on more creative opportunities outside of their traditional job role.</p><h3> Sponsor Entrepreneurship Within the Organization</h3><p> Adobe has put its money where its mouth is when trying to engage millennials. The company spent years (and likely lots of dollars) testing something called Kickbox, an open-source program that comes with a prepaid credit card, scorecards, frameworks, and anything else employees might need to run their own experiments. Every employee receives this package, and Adobe encourages everyone to use Kickbox to come up with innovative ideas, structured within the company itself.</p><h3> Reward Innovation</h3><p> In a company that fosters a culture of innovation, creative ideas must be rewarded. At least part of the employee recognition program should focus on rewarding workers for finding creative solutions to company problems, such as in workflow or administrative tasks, or finding new ways to tackle company procedures that could save time, money, or both. Knowing that this spirit is not only important but recognized within an organization will boost employee pride and encourage further innovation, which not only helps the employees but helps the business, too.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t keep doing the same things across different generations and expect the same results. To boost engagement for millennials in the workplace, give them what they want. And they&rsquo;re telling everyone they want an opportunity to take risks and take the reins of new opportunities.</p>",

    "title": "10 Simple Ways to WOW Clients",
    "link": "10-simple-ways-to-wow-clients",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Sometimes the difference between delivering what&rsquo;s expected and the WOW factor is smaller than most people think.I&rsquo;ve heard them called &ldquo;one percenters&rdquo;. Sometimes you might be doing a good job already, but all it takes is just a minute change to turn a run-of-the-mill process into a decidedly more special experience.If your clients end up telling others about it, who knows what could happen!Here are ten examples to consider: <strong>  1. Handwritten notes </strong>  &ndash; I once heard a young CEO tell how he managed to get meetings with 30 of his most experienced peers simply because he followed the advice of a business etiquette book written in the 1920s. One of the things he used to achieve this was simply a handwritten note, composed on thick quality paper with an ink pen. So simple, yet instantly more personal than an email. <strong>  2. Reserved parking </strong>  &ndash; Being able to offer clients a place to park is great. If when they arrive their name is written on the Reserved sign, it&rsquo;d be hard not to feel valued. All it takes is a small branded sign with an insert slot, and someone&rsquo;s time to print out a name. <strong>  3. The pen is mighty </strong>  &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure where I first heard the story, but it tells of a couple who, whilst signing documents with their adviser, commented on the quality of his pen. A few days later, the very same model of pen (new) arrived at their home by post. Of course, the adviser had gone to the trouble of not only choosing a great pen, but also buying a stock of them in expectation of this very deliberate way of wowing his clients. <strong>  4. Want to chat, have camera </strong>  &ndash; Online video is providing a much more personal way of not only communicating, but also sharing documents, images and other visual tools in a way you can&rsquo;t on the phone. However, being able to use this medium is dependent on your clients having the right equipment. Unless of course part of your approach is to send them a webcam and a link to the short YouTube video you recorded explaining how to install it. <strong>  5. Video messages </strong>  &ndash; On the same theme, it&rsquo;s incredible how much easier it is to record a quick video message to camera, or record your screen whilst you commentate (e.g. for instructional videos), compared to an email, not to mention much more personal. Now imagine your short video is to update clients on some element of their portfolio. Instant differentiation from the daily noise of e-communication. For screen recording, you can&rsquo;t go past the free program  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.techsmith.com/download/jing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jing  </a> </u> . <strong>  6. Google Alert them </strong>  &ndash; I once heard a tale of a CEO who, upon being promoted to a significantly more senior position, was blown away to receive a letter of congratulations from a hotel he frequented in New York. His first thought was, &ldquo;Wow. How did they do that?&rdquo; My guess is a variation on using  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com.au/alerts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Alerts  </a> </u> . For advisers with high profile clients, setting up search terms for those clients will often enable you to unexpectedly congratulate them on a promotion or other personal success when it happens. <strong>  7. Make an introduction </strong>  &ndash; Business and life are team sports, and the value of relationships and networks in that game is significant. Personally, one of the most valuable things for me is being introduced to someone with whom mutual value can be created. As an adviser, you sit at the centre of a web of all different types of people and businesses. The right intro can be remembered for a long, long time. <strong>  8. Publicise their business </strong>  &ndash; Sure, sharing information about specific clients businesses in your own newsletters (either as an advert, or perhaps a short article or video interview) might not necessarily bring that client floods of business, but the gesture will likely be well-remembered. <strong>  9. Find their &ldquo;thing&rdquo; </strong>  &ndash; Everybody has something, whether it&rsquo;s a fondness for commercial aircraft spotting, a history of playing in a band, love for a specific golf course or worthwhile cause, or even just an interest in a quirky topic. Remembering it, even if it&rsquo;s just in passing comment or by sending through an article of interest, shows you&rsquo;re listening. <strong>  10. Christmas decorations </strong>  &ndash; And finally, ditch the cards and grab some decorations. It&rsquo;s a gift that won&rsquo;t break the bank, yet it&rsquo;s amazing the creative ideas out there. I once found some crazy Dutch cows at a shop in Chatswood, but for those for whom shopping is not their favourite activity,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/au/search?q=christmas+tree+ornament&amp;order=most_relevant&amp;ship_to=AU&amp;ref=auto5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Etsy  </a> </u>  is a great option.</p>",

And banks were even happy to partner with online lenders like Santander with Funding Circle.</p><p> Now, with Goldman Sachs&rsquo; announcement, both Lending Club and Ondeck had to justify why GS would not be a threat. This is a game changer in my opinion, with banks having to ask themselves the question: how should online lending be part of their strategy? Should they partner with startups or develop their own solutions? </p><p> And what kind of online lending? Is it data-driven lending  a la Kabbage or Ondeck ? Is it p2p (b2p, b2b, p2b?) platforms  a la Lending Club or Funding Circle ? Is it invoice-financing  a la Finexkap or MarketInvoice ? It seems from the first reports that GS will focus on a Kabbage model &ndash; i.e. data-driven lending &ndash; but it would definitely make sense to have some disintermediation component for their institutional investors (i.e. p2p).</p><p> Going forward, this will obviously impact more than just online lending. It will be fascinating to see what happens over the next few months, and if other banks follow suit.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Over my 30 years working with financial advisors, I often find firms who utilize one of their clients to handle their Error &amp; Omissions (E&amp;O) Insurance. When we do, we scratch our heads because this decision could lead to unintended consequences, particularly in the areas of privacy and secrecy. This dual capacity scenario is akin to sports controversies where a team's questionable activities are leaked to the public. </p><h3> Having your dirty laundry aired in public could be quite 'deflating' to your business.</h3><p> <br/> The justification for having a client also as your firm's Professional E&amp;O broker is they invest money with you so feel obliged to reciprocate to secure/retain their assets.  The client, now insurance broker, isn&rsquo;t typically satisfied with just your Office Package Policy and Worker&rsquo;s Comp.  They want your E&amp;O because it's often a &ldquo;bigger ticket item.\" </p><h3> We'd argue this is not in your best interest. </h3><p> <br/> 1. You may be unintentionally trading assets to manage for coverage expertise, market specialization, and expanded leverage and/or access to key insurers.  Is their investment really worth the millions in increased exposure you may face?</p><p> 2. Unfortunately, financial firm like yours receive a claim made against them, face formal investigations, or have a routine regulatory inspection reports say unflattering things about them. Do you want a client (whose also your insurance agent) see this information?</p><p> 3. Equally troubling is when someone within that same agency gains access to this information and inadvertently discloses it over a few cocktails. Bad news travels quickly so is it worth the reputational risk?</p><p> 4. Seeing, policies, and procedures you may (or may not) have in place may jeopardize holding onto the same assets you wanted to retain.</p><p> 5. Worse, their dual capacity can lead them to a third role - as a claimant. They learn from your dirty laundry how to formulate their own claim against you.</p><p> 6. Now, the once harmless decision of dual capacity turns into a multi-headed hydra when the now claimant takes their claim to your E&amp;O carrier for adjudication.  Who has the ear of the carrier and who is more important to the insurer?</p><h3> In the end, we all recognize an angry investor can be your worse enemy in the claim process. </h3><p> <br/> Why make matters worse by giving them the keys to the kingdom?  Your fate may be in their hands.  </p>",

Cry When Criticized</h3><p> <br/> This club has a lot of members because no one wants to be criticized, but accept the fact that there is a huge difference between constructive criticism and vicious words spoken by petty critics.</p><p> You&rsquo;re confident enough to walk away from small minds that only want to tear you down.</p><h3> 3. Blame Others</h3><p> <br/> When I started whining about how unfair life was as a kid, my grandmother would look me in the eye and tell me to grow up. And that is my advice to you as well. Always take responsibility for your own actions. If you have any doubts about how ugly it looks and sounds to blame others and make excuses for yourself, take a closer look at our politicians.</p><p> Suck it up, admit your mistake, and move on.</p><p> Thanks, Grandma.</p><h3> 4. Confuse Money With Success</h3><p> <br/> America has become so obsessed with money and all the stuff it will buy that it&rsquo;s hard to have an intelligent conversation about what success should really mean to each one of us. Success is doing something with your life that gives you value and meaning.</p><p> Success is not just about making more money or going home with the most toys.</p><h3> 5. Refuse To Sacrifice</h3><p> <br/> There are some who might consider the Marine Corp Base in Quantico, VA a great place to spend 4 months&mdash;however, I am not one of them. But, during my time at the Academy, because of the starkness of my surroundings, I did get into the habit of sacrificing things that I wanted in the short term to achieve the more important goal&mdash;to become an FBI agent.</p><p> The road to success is not one of excess. You will need to focus, sacrifice, and set priorities.</p><h3> 6. Complacency Will Kill You</h3><p> <br/> One thing FBI agents learn early on in training is it&rsquo;s not the streets or guns that will kill you&mdash;complacency is what will put you in harm&rsquo;s way! Aways be alert and aware of what is going on in your environment. Opportunities are where your luck will hide, so always be searching for ways to make own your luck.</p><p> Complacency is where you go to wither up and die.</p><h3> 7. Complain About Working Hard</h3><p> <br/> My grandmother told me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get to the top if you sit on your bottom,&rdquo; and then she&rsquo;d hand me a shovel to clean out the horse barn. If you work harder than everyone else, you will achieve the success you are looking for.</p><p> No one has ever drowned in a pool of sweat.</p><h3> 8. Permit Negative Thoughts To Take Over</h3><p> <br/> I came very close to being washed out of the Academy because I wasn&rsquo;t a good athlete. The FIT test was hard for me, and I was tempted to let the spiral of negativity keep me from achieving my goal. Our survival-driven brain is wired to pay more attention to negative thoughts than positive ones, so we really do need to work harder at remaining positive when things get tough.</p><p> Mental toughness is positivity on steroids&mdash;LaRae Quy</p><h3> 9. Neglect Your Family</h3><p> <br/> Family looks different for everyone. Sometimes it&rsquo;s our children and the people to whom we are related, but just as often it also includes those we love and hold close to us.</p><p> You need to spend quality time with them and not neglect those relationships if you want true success in life.</p><h3> 10. Maintain Mediocre Friendships</h3><p> <br/> Since you don&rsquo;t have choice in who you&rsquo;re related to, be very careful in picking friends that will support you&mdash;in both good and bad times. My husband is an introvert who only counts a couple of buddies as close friends. I throw a much wider net and count lots of wonderful people as friends. The number doesn&rsquo;t matter, but you don&rsquo;t have either the time or the energy to surround yourself with mediocrity. That goes for friends, too.</p><h3> 11. Forget To Be Grateful</h3><p> <br/> When you stop being grateful, you have the worst kind of heart trouble. It&rsquo;s impossible to be negative or depressed when there is gratitude in your heart.</p><p> What bad habit have you broken lately?</p> ",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  You know we have a battle on our hands when even Accountants only get rated as &ldquo;High&rdquo; or &ldquo;Very High&rdquo; in professional ethics and honesty </strong> &hellip;.what chance that an Insurance Broker (for example) will rank higher in the publics mind?  Or a Financial Planner&hellip;or Mortgage Broker?</p><p> Last week I spotted yet another &ldquo;mystery shopper&rdquo; campaign by a magazine selling subscriptions to the public at large which found that yet another segment of the advice industry doesn&rsquo;t stack up, according to itself.</p><h3> Shock. Horror. Yawn&hellip;.here we go again.</h3><p> <br/> Call me cynical perhaps, but it does strike me that these &ldquo;consumer magazines&rdquo; which exist by selling subscriptions to fearful consumers seem to do rather well in the publicity stakes when they find, yet again, that a segment of the advice industry should be approached warily (if not be distrusted from the start) by consumers.  It seems a reasonably logical conclusion (for me anyway) that the more often a media publication can create distrust and alarm in an area of industry, and simultaneously position itself as the trusted source of information, the better it must be for their own circulation and subscription figures.  Bottom line: it is good for their business.</p><p> And they want to talk about transparency of business models and remuneration?</p><h3> Spare me the hypocrites.</h3><p> <br/> However&hellip;.the rags are not the only ones finding that there is a level of distrust in professional services.  As an aside I might well argue that the rags contribute heavily to creating much of the distrust, but we would also have to accept that there have been far too many instances in professional services of those within the industry not performing to the standards expected of professionals.  We have been shooting ourselves in both feet as it were, for far too long.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/gh-chart1-180714.png?w=610\"/></p><p> It is unlikely that any individual professional is going to change that public image. What is likely is that each individual professional can change that public image one client at a time, and is doing so. I make it a point of asking friends and members of the public what they think of financial advisers (being an area of professional services that gets hammered even more than lawyers do), and a recurring response is:</p><h3> &ldquo;financial advisers are rogues &ndash; except for mine. I got lucky&hellip;..&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> The actual wording is usually more diplomatic than that, but this is the sentiment usually.</p><p> At an individual practitioner level this does present an opportunity though.  When it comes to managing our own professional image &ndash; and I do mean each professional individually &ndash; perhaps the single greatest opportunity to rebuild some trust and credibility is to tackle the consumers fears head on.  Let&rsquo;s talk about &ldquo;the elephant in the room&rdquo;, instead of pretending it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p><p> The big issues that create the distrust are things like perceived or real conflicts; methods of payment; protection of client information and privacy; training and education standards; codes of conduct and consumer complaint redress&hellip;..all the things that the regulators and consumer groups focus upon.</p><h3> Why not take each of those issues and address them right up front?</h3><p> <br/> I am not talking about &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; here &ndash; that is nowhere near &ldquo;right up front&rdquo;.  Disclosure happens when a consumer has already taken a bit of a risk and made a decision to at least have a chat about engaging you&hellip;.we ned to hit these issues well before that point if we want our marketing to be successful.</p><p> We need to put our position on these topics out into the public domain where consumers who have NOT decided to engage with the profession can find them.</p><p> My point is that regardless of what your position is in any of the areas which concern consumers, you have an opportunity to break down barriers and distrust by being open and transparent about the big questions before consumers are making decisions about which professional to choose.</p><h3> Talk about the elephant, or rather the entire herd of elephants, in the room.  </h3><p> <br/> It is a fabulous marketing opportunity for every individual professional.  By tackling head on the issues raised by the rags you have an opportunity to create a position of trust and professional credibility for yourself.</p>",

    "link": "what-is-mild-cognitive-impairment",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> You hear the term now and again, &ldquo;MCI&rdquo;. Is it a diagnosis?</h3><p> <br/> Doctors sometimes tell an older patient he has this, but no one seems to exactly pin down what it means. How mild is &ldquo;mild&rdquo; and what does it mean in terms of diminished capacity?  Here it is in a nutshell:</p><p> Mild Cognitive Impairment refers to a degree of cognitive decline that is in between the cognitive changes associated with normal aging and those associated with clinical features of dementia.</p><p> Many people who get a diagnosis of MCI do go on to develop dementia but some do not.  Here&rsquo;s an example of a person who has MCI but does not have dementia.</p><p> Gertrude is 89 years of age and has been living alone in her own home. She got confused on her way home and was found driving on the wrong side of the road. A Good Samaritan brought her home. Fortunately, she did not hit any other cars. Cognitive decline was the cause of her confusion. She has mild cognitive impairment. She must not drive anymore, and she is willing to admit that she has to give up the keys.</p><h3> She can&rsquo;t remember what is in her bank account.</h3><p> <br/> Recently there was fraudulent activity and a large amount of cash was stolen by hackers.  She must also give up managing her own finances.</p><h3> Gertrude is very independent.</h3><p> <br/> She can take care of herself physically, though she does need her cane to walk.  She wears hearing aids, but is able to follow the conversation around her very well when she can hear. She is clear about her likes and dislikes and communicates them emphatically.  She is oriented to the date, and place where she is.  Her short term memory is poor.  She should not live alone any longer as she could forget to turn off the stove or the water faucet.</p><p> Gertrude is a good example of a person in what we call &ldquo;the gray zone&rdquo;. She is partly independent and partly dependent now.  She is able to do a lot for herself but she needs help with her finances particularly.  She appointed a licensed fiduciary to handle her bills and watch her bank accounts for her. She and the fiduciary went to both her banks to make sure the fiduciary&rsquo;s name is on the accounts.  She will have a companion live in with her to keep an eye on her safety but still allow her to do the things around the house and in the community she likes to do. The companion will do the driving.   As she gets older, her care needs will probably escalate. But for now, she has just what she needs and she accepts that her independence is getting limited by her memory loss.</p><p> If you know someone who seems to have the same issues as Gertrude, you will be interested in Chapter 10 of my book  <a href=\"http://aginginvestor.evsuite.com/familyguidebook/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Family Guide to Aging Parents: Answers to Your Legal, Financial and Healthcare Questions  </u>  .  </a>  That chapter is Protecting Our Aging Parents From Abuse.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about unconscious bias over the last several months, and we&rsquo;re not the only ones who have been doing so. </strong> While the headlines are full of stories about the effects of unconscious bias on policing, we&rsquo;ve focused&mdash;and continue to focus&mdash;on how this psychological phenomenon impacts decisions in the business world. As a brief refresher, unconscious bias is the tendency to judge others based on underlying beliefs or preconceptions of a particular group or type of person. Everyone exhibits unconscious bias, even those who vehemently oppose any form of stereotyping. It&rsquo;s simply human nature.</p><p> As we&rsquo;ve  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inclusion-inc.com/blog/2015/03/19/240/repressed_stereotypes_and_preconceptions_fuel_unconscious_bias/#.VUi41PlViko\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   discussed previously  </a> </u> , unconscious bias is often extremely difficult to root out precisely because it&rsquo;s unconscious.</p><h3> The first step is helping people to become aware of their biases.</h3><p> <br/> Once those biases have been identified, steps can be taken to proactively address them. That&rsquo;s precisely what some major global companies are doing to tackle unconscious bias in their own ranks.</p><p> In an article for Fortune titled &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/01/15/how-corporate-america-is-tackling-unconscious-bias/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How Corporate America is Tackling Unconscious Bias  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; Elizabeth G. Olson discusses how companies like Google, Roche Diagnostics and Royal Bank of Canada are addressing unconscious bias.</p><p> Olson notes that some companies attempt to eliminate the impact of unconscious bias on hiring decisions by removing names and other identifying information from resumes. Unfortunately, this strategy will only go so far. Few, if any, prestigious companies are going to hire someone based solely on a resume. At some point, the applicant&rsquo;s gender or race will become apparent, not just during the hiring process, but also in the workplace.</p><p> Fortunately, the companies Olson looked at are going the extra mile and confronting unconscious bias head-on. Google has been open about its gender diversity gap, recently acknowledging publicly that its workforce is 70 percent male. And, as Olson writes, &ldquo;Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) started an effort in May 2013 to raise awareness of bias among its 78,000 employees worldwide. Dr. Mahzarin Banaji, a Harvard University social ethics professor who co-authored  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553804642/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0553804642&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lingrenpoph-20&amp;linkId=WUUZMSY52KWNJSIC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Blind Spot: The Hidden Biases of Good People  </a> </u> , has held sessions for about 1,000 of RBC&rsquo;s executives to help alert them of their biases.&rdquo; Roche instituted an 18-month mentor program when it noticed that, although its hiring policies were attracting more women in entry-level positions, women weren&rsquo;t moving up the corporate ladder as quickly as their male counterparts.</p><h3> Overcoming unconscious bias is not an easy task.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s ingrained, cultural and hidden beneath the surface. Nevertheless, big companies are spending a great deal of time and effort tackling the problem. These for-profit companies obviously see a business reason for doing so, and hopefully others will soon follow suit. Will you?</p><p> Be inclusive!</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Many financial advisors ask us if they should have a blog.</h3><p> <br/> Our answer is, and always will be, &ldquo;YES.&rdquo; We support implementing a scheduled blog; however, blogging requires your time commitment to the task or have support staff to assist you.</p><p> Blogging, or self-publishing, is a powerful business building strategy. For years advisors have been encouraged to publish a book to gain credibility, influence, and trust from clients; and then use the book as a means to build a referral pipeline.  A blog extends book publishing to a much larger audience; faster and efficiently.</p><p> In this age of digital marketing, you need to continually build your digital presence. What worked 6 years ago, or even 6 months ago, has now changed. You need to be discoverable and relevant to your target market. Position yourself to connect, develop relationships, and build trust with prospective clients.</p><p> To establish your own voice and demonstrate your expertise and commitment to clients and prospects, your social strategy needs to encompass more than sharing links to articles written by others. A blog helps build your online presence and reputation, develop new relationships, improve communication, and position you as a thought leader in your community.</p><h3> The Benefits of Blogging</h3><p> <br/> A well-planned blog can prove to be the most important aspect of your digital strategy. Once you make a commitment and define your goals, a blog provides your firm with a multitude of benefits:</p><li> Depth to your marketing plan</li><li> Increased search engine optimization (SEO)</li><li> Increased traffic to your website</li><li> Ability to capture a larger prospect and referral pipeline</li><li> Expanded online community comprised of your target markets</li><li> Valuable content provided to your clients and prospects</li><li> Established credibility and trustworthiness <br/>  </li><p> Think of your blog like this:</p><li> VALUABLE CONTENT = TRUST</li><li> TRUST = LEADS</li><li> LEADS = SALES <br/>  </li><h3> Financial Advisor Blog Checklist &mdash; 10 Tips</h3><p> <br/> Your blog serves as the framework for your social strategy. Use the 10 tips below to get started with a well-designed blogging platform.</p><h3> 1. Make a Commitment</h3><p> Your blog requires a commitment. Use an editorial calendar to schedule topics you will write about. Focus your subject matter based upon the needs of your clients, prospects, and target audience.</p><h3> 2. Determine Your Blogging Goals </h3><p> Just like business goals, you need to establish goals for your blog. Start with simple goals; attracting readers and engaging with your online community. Ultimately, you want to move your online audience into your sales funnel and measure conversion rates. Download <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ironstone&rsquo;s Goal Planning Poster </a>  to track and measure your results.</p><h3> 3. Assign Responsibility </h3><p> Determine who will write your blog posts. Consider utilizing multiple team members, industry experts, and guest bloggers to keep your content relevant, valuable, and interesting. Assigning responsibility to a group of financial professionals will keep the pressure off one person.</p><h3> 4. Follow Compliance Regulations </h3><p> Ensure your blogging processes align with the guidelines of your compliance department. Incorporate your compliance regulations into your internal processes for a smooth transition as you create and publish your blog.</p><h3> 5. Research Your Audience</h3><p> Before writing and choosing content, research your audience. You have to understand who they are and what they need to ensure you provide valuable, quality content.</p><h3> 6. Be Intriguing With Headlines &amp; Content</h3><p> Content is the driving force behind your blog. Without quality content, your blog is doomed. Don&rsquo;t forget the headline of your article is as important as the content of your post. Grab your reader&rsquo;s attention with short and concise headlines; including enough information to describe your story.</p><h3> 7. Blog Frequency </h3><p> We preach to every advisor we work with that the quality of your blog carries a greater amount of influence than the quantity of posts. Keep your blog page fresh with updated content, but avoid the quantity craze. When you first begin blogging, start with a minimum of once or twice a month, increasing to weekly.</p><h3> 8. Use Personality</h3><p> One of the best ways to create reader loyalty is by letting your audience get to know you. Personalize your stories with your professional experiences.</p><h3> 9. Promote Your Blog</h3><p> There are several ways to promote your blog and let others know you provide quality content. Spread the word about your blog through social media channels, email notifications, and newsletters.</p><h3> 10. Always Include a Call-to-Action</h3><p> At the end of every blog post, include a call-to-action (CTA) that tells readers exactly what you want them to do next; leave a comment, subscribe to your blog, download a research paper, read a related article, or register for an event. Your CTA benefits the reader by providing additional resources and benefits your firm by generating new leads.</p><p> Social media has moved beyond a &ldquo;thought to entertain&rdquo; to a powerful, here-to-stay marketing channel not to be ignored. To position yourself as a trusted authority and an innovative financial advisory firm, you need to create, publish, and share content that resonates with your target market.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://ironstonehq.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Request more information  </a> </u>  from the Ironstone team or join the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=6665094&amp;trk=my_groups-b-grp-v\" target=\"_blank\">   Ironstone - Financial Industry Professionals Practice Management Group  </a> </u>  on LinkedIn and start a discussion.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> For those who are movie buffs, you will recognize the title of this blog from &ldquo;Field of Dreams&rdquo;.  The phrase refers to 1919 Chicago White Sox, who unfortunately became known as the Chicago Black Sox.  Many players on the Chicago team were accused of taking money from bookmakers to throw the World Series and were banned from baseball.  </p><p> In the movie, when a little boy was talking with a Chicago player that he looked up to, &ldquo;Shoeless&rdquo; Joe Jackson, he said, &ldquo;Say it ain&rsquo;t so, Joe&rdquo;.  The news about someone whom the child had put on a pedestal was breaking the boy&rsquo;s faith in baseball and he was hoping Joe would say the reports were not true.</p><h3> How does this relate to a blog from an investment guy?</h3><p> <br/> In my last blog,  <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/preston-d-mcswain/is-trying-to-pick-active-managers-a-losers-game/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   &ldquo;Is Trying to Pick Active Managers a Loser&rsquo;s Game?  </u>  &rdquo; </a> , I mentioned this line and, as I was expecting, it has come in for some criticism.</p><p> It is hard for many to believe what the numbers show: that index funds outperform most actively managed strategies.  </p><p> For many years, active management was the only game on Wall Street and managers with hot hands were, and still are, put on pedestals (see the link to Warren Buffett&rsquo;s advice below).  Many of us grew up in an investment world that was dominated by reports of star active portfolio managers.  For me, moving beyond this has been particularly hard.  </p><p> I spent the majority of my career successfully promoting and selling active management.  I believed in it and was good at it, rising to be a Managing Director and receiving awards from the Chairman of my firm for record sales of active strategies.  I have even written pieces on subjects such as how to find talented managers using tools such as Active Share (more on this in the future).  </p><h3> Sometimes I feel like the little guy in &ldquo;Field of Dreams&rdquo;.  </h3><p> <br/> I fundamentally believe that people who work harder should have an advantage and, even though I am now am convinced, a part of me still wants the answer to be different when research compares active managers to index funds.  </p><p> As with many things, however, it is not all about working harder.  You need to also work smarter, not let emotion get the better of you, and stay focused on solid evidence about what consistently works over long-term periods (please notice the use of the words long-term).  In the world of investing, this has made me a believer in so-called evidence-based investing which, based on long-term evidence, is biased toward index strategies.</p><p> I could write much more about this but, versus presenting only my ideas, I encourage you to take a look at the evidence yourself.  </p><p> At the end of this post, I have listed a few links to recent articles and research on this subject.  You can find other pieces on our Fiduciary Wealth Partners  <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/fiduciaryfwp/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Pinterest </a>  website, which we are experimenting with as a place to post articles.  If you have others articles or research papers on this point, please let us know and, as always, we welcome data that gives the other side of an argument.</p><p> Charts often tell a story best, so I include the following table from a 12/31/14 comprehensive study done by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.  It illustrates the percentage of U.S. equity funds that underperformed their appropriate benchmark index (a link to the full report is at the end of this post).</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Percentage-of-Funds-Underperforming-Benchmarks.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Percentage of Funds Underperforming Benchmarks\" src=\"http://www.fwp.partners/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Percentage-of-Funds-Underperforming-Benchmarks.png\"/> </a></p><p> In summary, the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices research reports that:</p><li> Based on data as of Dec. 31, 2014, 86.44% of large-cap fund managers underperformed the benchmark over a one-year period. This figure is equally unfavorable when viewed over longer-term investment horizons. Over 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, 88.65% and 82.07% of large-cap managers failed to deliver incremental returns over the benchmark.</li><li> The returns of 66.23% of mid-cap managers and 72.92% of small-cap managers lagged those of the S&amp;P MidCap 400&reg; and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600&reg;, respectively, on a one-year basis.  Similar to the results in the large-cap space, the overwhelming majority of mid- and small-cap fund managers underperformed their benchmarks over the longer-term horizons as well.</li><li> It is commonly believed that active management works best in inefficient environments, such as small-cap or emerging markets.  This argument is disputed by the findings of this SPIVA Scorecard.  The majority of small-cap active managers consistently has been underperforming the benchmark over the full 10-year period as well as each rolling 5-year period, with data starting in 2002.</li><li> The lowest percentage of outperformance by active mangers has tended to occur in the best-performing asset classes.  Among the nine U.S. style categories, mid-cap growth was the best-performing asset class over the past 10 years, with the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Growth returning 10.03%.  However, it is also the category where the highest percentages of managers (91.81%) have underperformed.</li><li> International and emerging market equity indices posted negative returns in 2014.  During the same period, the majority of the active managers investing in international, international small-cap, and emerging markets equities fared worse than their benchmark indices. <br/>  </li><h3> Say it ain&rsquo;t so, Joe.

Together, they unloaded all of the packets of LEGO and instruction books.  I could hear from down the hall as his friend took control, &ldquo;This is what we need to do first, sort by color than shape.&rdquo; </p><p> At dinner, our son told us in no uncertain terms,  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/life-leadership-lego/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this is how you do LEGO </a> , his friend told him so. Funny to hear because he&rsquo;s put together countless LEGO sets before this afternoon and did just fine.  My response? &ldquo;So what?

Unfortunately, you may not even realize that you&rsquo;re using someone else&rsquo;s definition of success as the blueprint for your choices and actions. </p><p> You can google &ldquo;values list&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll come up with just shy of a billion results. A billion. Every list you click on, you&rsquo;ll see hundreds of things that you should value and probably do. How do you discern what&rsquo;s most important, your strongest values, when they all sound relevant?</p><p> It&rsquo;s your values that determine your actions. When your values and actions are out of sync, it&rsquo;s when you start to feel like a zombie instead of human. Even subtle differences in values can lead to a course of action either feeling inspired or like energy zapping effort. </p><p> One person values safety, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leaders-embrace-the-adventure/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you may value adventure  </a> </u> . </p><p> Another person values organization, and you may value inner harmony more. </p><p> Yet another values wealth while the concept of freedom speaks louder to you.</p><h3> Values, not must-dos, guide you to your next step.</h3><p> <br/> Here are some next steps that I hear a lot:</p><p> &ldquo;I have no choice but to work late.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I need to buy new clothes for the season.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I must get on Twitter today or they&rsquo;ll forget about me.&rdquo;</p><p> Just like I asked my son, ask yourself&hellip;&rdquo;Really??&rdquo;</p><p> Have to</p><p> Need to</p><p> Must</p><p> Think about your values as your personal instruction booklet to determine if you sort by color, shape, or wing it. It&rsquo;s how you move past the &ldquo;must,&rdquo; &ldquo;need to,&rdquo; and &ldquo;have to&rdquo; in order to figure out your &ldquo;want to.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  TIP: You won&rsquo;t find your values on a list.  Look at your life to discover your values in motion. </strong></p><h3> Vision</h3><p> <br/> Having a goal is not the same as having a vision. </p><p> Part of a vision is about the experience of getting to your goal.  </p><p> You don&rsquo;t run a marathon without training for it.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t publish a book without  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/7-must-dos-editing-your-writing-leadership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   writing and editing  </a> </u> .</p><p> You will never run a successful company without transitioning from idea to reality. </p><h3> Create a robust vision bigger than a single goal to make it irresistible.</h3><p>    <br/> For my son, his vision for building his new LEGO set was to do it with a friend, not only to have a new model in his collection. For one of my clients, her vision was not only to work for a nonprofit, but also stretch her skills in new directions. </p><p> You probably know what it&rsquo;s like to have a  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/mind-the-expectations-gap/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   gap between your vision and your experience  </a> </u> . For example:</p><p> Have you ever taken a new job and it&rsquo;s nothing like you expected?</p><p> Have you ever dated someone who seemed perfect, until two months in when perfection became smothering?</p><p> Have you ever planned a trip for months only end up running around seeing all of the must see attractions and feeling let down?</p><p> When you go after something &ldquo;at all costs,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s too late when you realize that the cost was too high. Is it really worth stomping on your values to tick a box on your to-do list?</p><p> The most robust visions encompass the adventure; feeling, seeing, and being are all accounted for and equally important. </p><p> <strong>  TIP: Create a vision not only for your end goal, but also for the journey.  </strong></p><h3> Perspective</h3><p> <br/> Your next step is less about your circumstances and more about the way you see them. </p><p> Call it what you want, your perspective, your attitude,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leadership-mindset-create-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your mindset  </a> </u> &hellip; If you see roadblocks and limits instead of possibilities and potential, you&rsquo;re stuck. Even if you know what to do, you&rsquo;re not going to do it with gusto but instead you&rsquo;ll be leading the way forward with limitations. </p><h3> Perspective can keep you playing small or giving it your all.</h3><p> <br/> I know far too many people who think that their next step is giving up.  I assure you,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/there-is-always-a-way/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   there is always a way forward  </a> </u> , you just have to look for it. </p><p> My son believed that his friend had it right, that there was one best way to build a LEGO set despite his personal experience. I&rsquo;ve seen incredibly smart leaders get stuck in the belief that their boss knows best. (Sorry if I&rsquo;ve offended you, bosses)</p><p> I also know people who get  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/life-feels-like-broken-record/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   stuck in a rut  </a> </u>  and don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re there. The next step that seemed so obvious is no longer the right step at all. </p><p> The last time I tried to lose weight, I cut out sugar and exercised three days a week. Why isn&rsquo;t it working?</p><p> Top talent is walking out the door. Last time we offered a salary increase and they stayed.  Why are they still leaving?</p><p> What rut have you fallen into?  What are you still doing because that&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;ve always done it?</p><p> <strong>  TIP: When you only see limited options, your perceived next step may not light you up.  To multiply your choices, shift your perspective.  Your next step will absolutely, positively become clear.  </strong></p><p> I hear it all the time:</p><p> &ldquo;I have no choice.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;It always worked for me before.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I was just following directions.&rdquo;</p><p> It could be that sorting by color is the way to go and maybe it&rsquo;s not. It could be that the color sort worked last time, but this time there&rsquo;s a better way to go. Awaken to possibilities and have the courage to give it a go.</p><p> Values, vision and your perspective are three powerful ways to tap into meaningful action. Blindly following orders will inevitably leave you unfulfilled. Now is the time for clarity, confidence, creativity and your next step (the one you&rsquo;re inspired to take). Lead on! </p>",

    "content": "<p> There are four main reasons my MBA students give me for wanting to work for the big guys versus a smaller company: prestige, salary/benefits, room for upward mobility, and security. Tough factors for the small guys to compete with for sure. Interesting, those conversations have been juxtaposed with interviews I&rsquo;ve been doing this week for a mid-sized client, as we&rsquo;re looking to take their social media strategy to the next level.</p><h3> Guess who&rsquo;s applying? Rock stars from the big guys, yup, even MBAs.</h3><p> <br/> When I ask these candidates, &ldquo;Why would you consider leaving ______ (insert prestigious, high-paying, great benefits, relatively secure company name here)?&rdquo; the answer is they want a place where they can move faster (less bureaucracy) and be more creative. They want to work for folks who have a strong vision, but are wide open to new ideas (ahh, the sweet smell of  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MagneticHumility_v21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   confident humility  </a> </u>  as a competitive weapon).</p><p> Of course smaller doesn&rsquo;t always equate to faster, more creative, or a culture of confident humility, but in this case that&rsquo;s the value proposition. And it&rsquo;s working. Score one for the  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/authenticity-transparency-trust/4-reasons-underdogs-will-rule-the-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   underdogs  </u>  .  </a></p><h3> 1. Create a Clear Value Proposition</h3><p> <br/> Most smaller companies work this backward, reactively trying to piece together a competitive offer, or packaging their recruiting story so it looks good on paper. To truly attract and retain the best talent in your industry, you&rsquo;ll need a deliberate plan.</p><p> Start with your vision: What&rsquo;s most important to your ideal candidates? What do you want to be known for as an employer? Then do realistic assessment of your current state. Nothing&rsquo;s worse than telling candidates you&rsquo;re fast and creative, if you&rsquo;re slow and stodgy. The only way to develop a genuine and lasting value proposition is to have a realistic understanding of your gaps.</p><h3> 2. Sell Your Why</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=simon+sinek%27s+golden+circle&amp;FORM=VIRE10#view=detail&amp;mid=D9CD868DE4CF53FDFCC4D9CD868DE4CF53FDFCC4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Simon Sinek&rsquo;s golden circle </a>  isn&rsquo;t just about leadership and marketing, it&rsquo;s vital in the talent wars. The best and brightest are looking for a &ldquo;why&rdquo; that matters. Be sure you can articulate yours.</p><h3> 3. Engage Your Team</h3><p> <br/> The 360 interview process is working great for my client because the candidates get to talk to a lot of fired up people. If your team&rsquo;s fired up, get them involved to help interview. If they&rsquo;re remote, video interviews are a great option. Plus, your team will bring different perspectives and be a good gauge of cultural fit. Of course, if your team&rsquo;s not fired up, you&rsquo;ve got bigger issues. Call me, I can help.</p><h3> 4. Rock Social Media</h3><p> <br/> Go hang out where the talent is. Most of the folks you really want are not looking on job boards. Showing up strong is an easy way to attract the attention of great people who might not otherwise be looking.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarjiJSherman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Marji Sherman  </u> </a></p><p> I finally received my last box from moving from NYC to South Florida. I say &ldquo;finally&rdquo; because it has been quite the ordeal. I received a phone call last week that The UPS Store in NYC had my box, which was odd since I sent my box from The UPS Store in NYC to Florida. The woman explained to me that they had tried three times to deliver it, and protocol is to deliver it back to the sender if delivery fails on the third try. Which is ironic, because I, the sender, do not live at The UPS Store in NYC. I asked her when they delivered it in South Florida, because the person I sent it to had no recollection of it, and had received the two others boxes I sent from The UPS Store. She said she couldn&rsquo;t tell me anything because they are franchised, and she had no way to contact the store in Florida and ask them any questions &ndash;&gt; WTF.</p><p> Furious, I asked the woman to send the box back to Florida. She said she could if I repaid the $70 for shipping. I calmly (at least I hope I was calm) told her that I would call her back, and then took to Twitter AND Facebook. I have to be pretty pissed off in order to go on two platforms. Within a couple of hours I had a response on both platforms to email a particular address.</p><p> Within minutes of emailing, I had a response. First, they said they would look into it. Then, they said there was nothing they could do because they tried to deliver it three times. I asked my friend if she had received any notification that they had tried to deliver three times, and she said she had two BLANK slips on her door over the past month and had no idea what they were for. I quickly responded back to The UPS Store and said that on top of all of this, they didn&rsquo;t even have the right name on my packages. Instead of Marji Sherman, I was Marjoari with some random last name. Within minutes of that email I was told The UPS Store&rsquo;s corporate headquarters were contacted and someone would be in touch with me.</p><p> The next day, that someone called me and said that she would write me a $25 check because she could see both sides. She told me technically I should have double-checked the name before I signed my receipt. (FYI- I found my receipt with a tracking number later, and they did not have me sign it, and they didn&rsquo;t write out my name on it.) I said that wasn&rsquo;t going to fly, so then she agreed to have it shipped to where I was for no charge.</p><p> Moral of the story&ndash;&gt; This is actually a GOOD post. While I am incredibly irritated by The UPS Store and hope that my complaint somewhat cleans up the NYC location, their social media was right on par with handling my complaint. Here&rsquo;s five things to learn from this situation for your own customer service team:</p><h3> Be timely</h3><p> <br/> Within hours (which is incredible for a huge brand), they replied back to me. This is a MUST for brands that have customer service issues. The quicker you nip a complaint in the butt, the more likely you are to keep the customer from causing an all out firestorm on social media.</p><h3> Cover ALL of your bases</h3><p> <br/> Just because they replied to my Tweet, they didn&rsquo;t ignore my Facebook post. You can&rsquo;t assume that just because you reply to a customer on one network, you can ignore their posts on your other networks. First, replying to all posts makes the customer feel more valued, and second, it&rsquo;s a smart move by a brand to ensure that other fans on those networks see you are not leaving any post unanswered.</p><h3> Take the complaint to the right place</h3><p> <br/> They did not mess around and immediately took my complaint to the corporate office for The UPS Store, even though the store itself in NYC told me there was nothing they could do because they&rsquo;re franchised. Instead of being bounced from department to department, the social media customer service reps knew exactly where to send my complaint.</p><h3> Be patient</h3><p> <br/> I was NOT HAPPY, to put it nicely, yet the social media crew kindly responded to every one of my emails and made sure to keep the ball rolling.</p><h3> Deliver</h3><p> <br/> By sending me to the right place, I was able to get a complaint on record for The UPS Store in NYC (which corporate assured me is taken very seriously), and I received my package quickly after I sent my initial Tweet.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been on the customer service end of social media numerous times, and it&rsquo;s so easy to try to skate by some of the complaints out there. I mean, how many bitchy Tweets can you really deal with everyday? The fact of the matter is, you have to deal with ALL of them&ndash;&gt; Not only because you owe it to your consumers, but because you never know which small complaint ignored will ignite that customer service nightmare you often times hear about.</p><p> Social media is a powerful tool and consumers KNOW that. They are very much aware that they can easily affect your reputation with a few harsh words and/or photos of defective products. Now, this isn&rsquo;t something that should scare you, but motivate you to activate intense social listening so you can know what your consumers are saying about you and what issues they are having. Some of the feedback from social listening can actually be super helpful in identifying issues with products, fostering new business ideas and cementing relationships with core consumers.</p><p> <strong>  Kudos to The UPS Store social media team for showing us all what it means to be incredible at customer service in an age where the consumer has the majority of the power. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> If you are building a social audience to generate more website traffic, are you sure you&rsquo;re social content meets this objective? There is a balance to optimizing your content on social media to double traffic to your site. It&rsquo;s both an Art and Science.</p><p> Here are 3 ways to double your website traffic from social media&hellip;</p><h3> 1. Share Your Content More Than Once</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re serious about creating content that brings people to your owned media (i.e. your website) then you should be serious about utilizing social media to drive more traffic to your site. A great way to do this is by sharing your content more than once.</p><p> I know first hand that this has helped bring more traffic to my blog. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-15-at-7.19.37-AM.png\" width=\"713\"/></p><p> I shared a recent blog post titled &ldquo; <u>  3 Awesome Ways to Test Your Marketing Campaigns </u> &rdquo; on Feb 17th and 18th. By posting this twice, I accumulated 137 engagements with almost 800K potential impressions. If I only posted this once, I would have received less than half the engagements and impressions. Imagine if I would have shared this a third time. I think you get the point.</p><p> I must note, some people will argue against the practice of sharing content multiple times on the same social network, however, it&rsquo;s difficult to argue the results. Sharing your content multiple times can double your website traffic.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s another tactic&hellip;</p><h3> 2. Optimize Your Content for Each Network</h3><h3> <br/> Twitter &ndash; Briefly offer solutions to the challenges of your audience.</h3><p> For example, instead of tweeting the link to a free content marketing calendar, I posed a question to appeal to those who need help structuring their content. This works for all social media networks as well, but since users are limited to 140 characters, they tend to tweet only the article titles.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-15-at-7.19.56-AM.png\" width=\"554\"/></p><h3> Facebook &ndash; Have a conversational tone.</h3><p> It seems as though Facebook rewards posts from friends and family over brand pages. So, I suspect sales messages in Facebook posts may not receive the same organic reach as posts with more conversational tones.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-15-at-7.20.01-AM.png\" width=\"517\"/></p><h3> Instagram &ndash; Include hashtags</h3><p> Hashtags on Instagram are equally important as photos. While scrolling the image search on Instagram you&rsquo;ll notice very creative hashtags. Hashtags such as #puddlegram, #fromwhereistand, and #jumpstagram make the network so engaging. So, if you want to increase engagement on Instagram, be sure to include multiple hashtags&ndash;and be creative with it!</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-15-at-7.20.30-AM.png\" width=\"345\"/></p><p> By using hashtags on Instagram you will draw more attention to your profile that will, hopefully, have your website URL.</p><h3> LinkedIn &ndash; Stimulate professional discussion.</h3><p> Remember that LinkedIn is known for having professional users. So, your content should create discussions around your industry. In the example below I centered the update to appeal to my following. I achieved this by giving a brief summary and solution.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-15-at-7.20.45-AM.png\" width=\"582\"/></p><h3> 3. Monitor Your Results</h3><p> <br/> Monitoring your results is probably the single most important thing you can do to double the website traffic from your social media. There is a balance between a constant flow of social posts and website traffic. It is important to understand how one compliments the other.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how you get started&hellip;</p><li> <strong>  Identify and increase/decrease your post activity.  </strong> When I noticed a drop in post engagements, I focused on posting older blog articles to stimulate engagements. Finding a balance is imperative and by reincorporating older posts, this can increase the flow of social media traffic to your website.</li><li> <strong>  Monitor the feedback from your audience. </strong>  Although you can&rsquo;t let one detractor speak for the rest, it&rsquo;s beneficial to listen closely to how your audience is responding to your posting schedule. If people are thanking you for the frequent content you provide, you know your scheduling works. However, most social media users will simply un-follow instead of taking the time to express their disliking. At this point, you should review their actions as a form of feedback. <br/>  </li><p> Can you think of other ways to bring more social traffic to your website?  <u>  Click here </u>  to comment.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Okay, I know I need to go to a treatment program for this, but every once in awhile I get this urge to bust a few myths and shake things up. In particular, I like to do this around the topic of employee engagement. I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p><p> If you think that the great &lsquo;engagement fairy&rsquo; is going to fly down and wave their magic wand and proclaim that you are suddenly highly engaged at work, life just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p><p> Back in my days as a senior human resources executive, I came across so many employees of all ages who truly believed that they were entitled to the big office, a huge raise, promotion to their bosses job or the best parking space in the garage.  My favorite were the people who came in to interview with me and spent more time asking what our company could do for them, versus what they could do for us.  How much do you want to bet that this group of &lsquo;entitlement seekers&rsquo; was some of your least engaged employees?</p><h3> Engagement isn&rsquo;t a right,</h3><p> <br/> its something that happens because you are working in an environment that allows you to do the best work you can. Employees want nothing more than to be part of something meaningful and feel like they&rsquo;ve had a hand in making a difference. They want to be part of something bigger than themselves and part of the underlying success. They want to be energized by their job and look forward to going to work, willing to put in the extra effort it takes to make their organization a success.</p><h3> No one group alone can own 100% of engagement,</h3><p> <br/> there needs to be some level of ownership from senior leadership, managers as well as individual employees. However, there are some really important things that each employee can personally do on their journey to attain high engagement.</p><h3> Here are my top 4 steps for employees to take to reach this goal. <br/>  </h3><li> Employees need to take personal accountability for their engagement at work.  Just sitting back, waiting and hoping for divine inspiration will not lead to engagement. It takes an effort from each and every employee to move the needle.</li><li> Employees need to identify the motivation triggers that matter most to them and help their manager to understand what they need.  No one knows what you need to be engaged better than you. Find your voice and speak up. Most managers are not mind readers.</li><li> Employees need to know how to work well with their boss. Management is not a one-way street; it requires participation from two people who both believe they have a stake in the outcome of the relationship.</li><li> Employees want to be part of something bigger than them &mdash; something for which they can be proud.  Finding meaning in your work is one of the major cornerstones to achieving the magic of engagement. If you believe in the work you are doing and the mission of the company, it is easy to engage with the work. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  No one knows what it takes to engage you but you! It&rsquo;s time to step up and stop waiting for someone else to do it for you. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> What is storytelling, and why is it an important tool to have in your CX Toolbox?  <br/> <br/> In a post I wrote several months ago, I outlined the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/07/transforming-customer-experience-with.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 Rules for Turning Data into Action for a Better Customer Experience  </a> </u> : Centralize, Analyze, Socialize, Strategize, and Operationalize. I have since pulled out details from Analyze and Socialize to create a sixth rule:  Synthesize (or Contextualize).</p><h3> What does that mean?</h3><p> <br/> Synthesize is really the opposite of analyze. Once data have been broken down and analyzed for better understanding, they are most useful for the end user when they are transformed into insights; those insights are best ingested/digested in the form of a story. That means putting all the pieces of the analysis together to tell a story, putting them into context for those who need to act on it - a story that can be easily understood and translated into a better customer experience. Here&rsquo;s where we tell the audience what a great experience looks like. <br/> <br/> The example I like to give is one of a client of mine that was offering repair service in their stores. We listened to customers about the experience and uncovered that there are three activities that had to happen for the customer to leave completely satisfied and likely to recommend (a Promoter). We spun those details into a story for the employees so that they could walk in the customer&rsquo;s shoes, too, to understand what that experience had to be like. The service they provided improved almost immediately. Employees were able to contextualize/visualize what a great experience looked like. So, rather than using metrics and charts to tell employees what customers want, we spun a story for better understanding <br/> <br/> Let me take a few steps back and answer some basic questions about storytelling.</p><h3> What is storytelling?</h3><p> <br/> Storytelling is a communication tool and a teaching tool. It's a Trojan horse for learning. You can tell stories, and people will listen; they won't even know that they're (supposed to be) learning! Stories allow you to deliver a message in a way that engages people, inspires them, and helps them understand a desired or intended outcome as a result of a series of steps or actions taken.</p><h3> Why use storytelling in your customer experience management strategy?</h3><p> <br/> Quite simply, storytelling is a tool to gain buy-in, whether it's from executives or from the frontline. Storytelling can facilitate delivering an impact from both the emotional and the rational perspective, capturing both the hearts and minds of the intended audience. <br/> <br/> I believe that bombarding the frontline with charts, graphs, metrics, and bullet points is not the way to teach them or to inspire them to deliver a great customer experience. Setting an example or being a role model is probably the best way to teach; absent that, when we tell a story about the intended customer experience, it paints a picture of what is expected; we end up taking employees on a journey, the customer's journey. And it humanizes the experience. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Stories can also be used to recognize or to reinforce desired behaviors. People connect to stories and, therefore, remember them/the point. </strong> <br/> <br/> In addition, stories... </p><li> clarify and help the audience understand</li><li> give you background information</li><li> convey what the characters (customers) think, do, feel </li><li> bring a concept or experience to life</li><li> engage the audience (employees)</li><li> explain the ideal customer experience</li><li> sell (concepts and products)</li><li> support change</li><li> reinforce </li><li> motivate and inspire</li><li> facilitate empathy and understanding</li><li> help you connect</li><li> draw the audience into the story, carry you away</li><li> help the audience relate</li><li> convey good and bad, successes and failures</li><li> are memorable <br/>  </li><h3> Can anyone be a CX storyteller? Or must it be taught?</h3><p> <br/> I don't believe that everyone is a natural born storyteller. I do think some people need to be taught. Can it be taught? Yes. To some degree. It does take creativity, but if we can develop that creativity, we can teach storytelling.</p><h3> How do you teach storytelling?</h3><p> <br/> I think we need to break it down into bite-sized chunks. Stories have various components to them, so the teaching begins with those components, including...</p><li> the usual: who, what, when, where, why</li><li> the business challenge or problem</li><li> the customer challenge or problem</li><li> steps to re-create the challenge or problem</li><li> the thinking, doing, feeling of the participant</li><li> the desired actions and outcome, the  <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/denouement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   denouement  </u> </a> <br/>  </li><p>  ... and we must also consider...</p><li> the audience: different audiences require different messages or different levels of detail</li><li> what's the message; what are you trying to convey</li><li> how will you tell it</li><li> how will the audience participate after you tell it</li><li> how does participation affect the story or change the outcome in the future <br/>  </li><p> I also think that, for teaching purposes, we need to ensure future storytellers...</p><li> Draw on their own experiences for anecdotes and to help connect with the audience</li><li> Share their own lessons learned</li><li> Stay on point and keep it focused/straightforward <br/>  </li><p> This TED talk from storyteller and filmmaker Andrew Stanton (WALL-E, Toy Story, and more) provides the clues to a great story. It's worth the watch, if you want to learn how to tell a story.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KxDwieKpawg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-12.26.07-PM.png\" width=\"848\"/> </a></p><p> click to watch</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.moreknown.com/clues-to-a-great-story/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MoreKnown.com  </a> </u>  summarizes his seven clues to a great story:</p><li> Know your punchline, your ending. Everything in your story is leading to one resolution.</li><li> The number one rule of a good story is to make your audience care. All of these rules help to accomplish this.</li><li> Make a promise. Promise the reader (or listener, or viewer, or whatever) that the story will be worth their time. This will propel you from the start to the end of the story.</li><li> Hide the fact that your reader will have to do some of the work themselves. &ldquo;Absence of information draws us in.&rdquo; You will have to choose the order of events and what to include/exclude, but your audience connects to the story when they have to figure things out for themselves.</li><li> It&rsquo;s alright to nod to a grand design. In Lawrence of Arabia, Stanton points out a scene that directly asks the protagonist, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; This is the theme of the whole film. Have a theme.</li><li> If it's possible, allow your audience to surrender to wonder. This is the secret sauce of the best stories.</li><li> Focus on your personal strengths as you tell your story. Use what you know. <br/>  </li><p> In your organization, do you use stories to teach? How do you tell your customer experience stories? <br/> <br/> <strong>  Storytelling is the most powerful way to put ideas into the world today. -Robert McKee </strong></p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Recently, I&rsquo;ve been getting back into Twitter. It&rsquo;s not that I left, but my attention was needed elsewhere and I haven&rsquo;t been able to nurture and grow my Twitter community as I did in the old days.</p><p> And speaking of the old days &ndash; things have CHANGED in Twitterland!</p><p> It&rsquo;s almost like coming back to a foreign land &ndash; one that I still instinctively know like an old friend, but one that changed the way it speaks and how it holds my hand. And I&rsquo;ve gotta say &ndash; it&rsquo;s disturbing.</p><p> Automation has taken over Twitter in a REAL way, and while there is plenty to love and be grateful for outside of automation, this article will address the worst strategies I&rsquo;m seeing proliferated all over on Twitter.</p><p> You might argue that these strategies yield results in terms of numbers, and they may &ndash; but Twitter, at least the old Twitter, is all about community, not numbers. People on social media are people, they aren&rsquo;t statistics or ratios &ndash; they are people, and should be treated as such.</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t experiencing REAL relationships, genuine interaction and exchange, and a growth in your knowledge base &ndash; then you aren&rsquo;t doing Twitter right!</p><p> Here are the 3 strategies KILLING your Twitter game.</p><h3> Auto DM&rsquo;s</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve spoken before about  <u>  <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/5-ways-to-tick-people-off-on-social-media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Auto DM&rsquo;s being my biggest pet peeve in social media  </a> </u> , but I think the next two points of this post are equal in my waging my irritation.</p><p> Auto DM&rsquo;s have been around since the early days, but it was rarely used, so rarely that I hardly knew when it happened. But I was always disappointed to find out those welcoming messages weren&rsquo;t real. I felt foolish and duped.</p><p> Auto DM&rsquo;s are about the rudest thing you can do on Twitter, just ask  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskAaronLee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Aaron Lee  </a> </u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskAaronLee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   ,  </u> </a> who likens them to people who shove their business cards in your face at networking events. How dead on is that?</p><p> Regardless of how you believe they may be helping you, I can guarantee they are doing more harm than good.</p><p> The only people who are open to Auto DM&rsquo;s are new to Twitter or doing the same thing to their new followers. The folks who are actively engaged in Twitter are VERY anti auto-DM&rsquo;s, and many unfollow immediately.</p><p> Personally, I don&rsquo;t even bother reading them, and automatically get a funky feeling about the person.</p><p> Let me be clear when I say that there are a certain number of people sending out auto DM&rsquo;s who have no idea that it&rsquo;s rude, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing this article &ndash; because sometimes we just need to be let in on the rules of social media etiquette.</p><p> But the ones that really take the cake are the auto DM&rsquo;s who don&rsquo;t just auto DM you, but in addition ASK you to do something for them &ndash; even though they&rsquo;ve never even said hello. Bleh.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-11.55.37-AM.png\" width=\"697\"/></p><p> Wouldn&rsquo;t you consider that message above spam?</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t like receiving promotional emails in your inbox that you never signed up for &ndash; why would you do the same thing to a stranger on Twitter??</p><p> Gotta tell you &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t make friends.</p><p> It may take longer to get to know people, but that&rsquo;s REAL social media &ndash; being social, saying hi, getting to know them and then if they ask about your business, great. But the soft touch is what converts people into real business.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t believe me &ndash; just ask  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fondalo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Robert Caruso of BundlePost  </a> </u> . We were friends on Twitter for about 6 months before I asked about BundlePost &ndash; he never pushed it, never even mentioned it, and now I&rsquo;m one of his &amp; BP&rsquo;s biggest fans! We use it for my agency and  <u>  <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/bundlepost-the-social-media-management-tool-i-cant-live-without/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I&rsquo;ve blogged about it  </a> </u>  several times.</p><p> That&rsquo;s how social media works!</p><h3> Automated Replies</h3><p> <br/> If you could hear me groaning at just the mention of automated replies &ndash; you&rsquo;d have someeee idea of how much this irritates me.</p><p> We didn&rsquo;t have automated replies on Twitter back in 2009 when I first came on the scene &ndash; in fact, it&rsquo;s a totally new animal that&rsquo;s reared its ugly head in the past year. But I&rsquo;ve been experiencing it on a daily basis, and seen (GASP) well-known social media professionals using this to generate sales for their products/services!!</p><p> This is NOT how we conduct ourselves on social media!</p><p> The worst is when I follow someone, get an automated reply, then go check out who they are and they aren&rsquo;t even following me!!! What the heck?? Talk about being busted!</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"609\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-11.56.17-AM.png\" width=\"497\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"616\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-11.56.24-AM.png\" width=\"495\"/></p><p> This goes so far against what automation was created for that I just want to scream!</p><p> Folks, automation was created so we could spend less time aggregating content and more time ENGAGING!! And what is less like engaging than sending out an automated welcome to a brand new person who is interested in you?!</p><p> The bottom line is &ndash; this is NOT social media. This is yet again, treating people as numbers &ndash; churn them in and out at a fast rate and keep going.</p><p> Social media is SO much more than this, and I urge you &ndash; beg you &ndash; to turn those auto replies off and get down and dirty with Twitter yourself. If you&rsquo;re so busy that you can&rsquo;t answer everything, hire someone &ndash; don&rsquo;t let the integrity of your personal brand or business be hurt by this activity.</p><p> You&rsquo;re better than automated replies. Period.</p><h3> TrueTwit</h3><p> <br/> This has got to be the WORST Twitter service ever invented. It puts a barrier between you and people who are trying to get to know you &ndash; the opposite of what it promises.</p><p> Whenever I see THIS message below pop up, it&rsquo;s an automatic unfollow on me end &ndash; why? Because it says to me that I&rsquo;m dealing with someone who isn&rsquo;t interested in putting in a little effort to read my bio, check out my tweets or find out that I am human on their own, i.e. LAZY.</p><p> Imagine if you met someone at a party and they said, &ldquo;Before I can talk to you, I need to make sure you&rsquo;re allowed to be here.&rdquo; How would you feel?! That&rsquo;s basically what TrueTwit does to the folks who are looking to meet you online.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a service that supposedly helps Twitter users be able to differentiate between real users and bots. But if you are THAT disconnected from your Twitter account, then you aren&rsquo;t actively participating in social media anyway. You are allowing a non-entity to decide who your friends are, and ticking a lot of people off in the meantime.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-11.56.48-AM.png\" width=\"697\"/></p><p> You might think there is a difference in how we treat people online and in-person, but there shouldn&rsquo;t be. We must be present when others reply, thank them, be kind, be helpful, add value, smile, and make them laugh. The moment you consider your online relationships to be numbers or distant relationships, you drop the ball and aren&rsquo;t able to experience the awesomeness of social media.</p><p> Bottom line, the Twitter community is about relationships, people, and engagement. These practices put a barrier between you and the people you&rsquo;d like to interact with and make it difficult for others to get to know you.</p><p> If you are new to social media, take these points to heart because it will better your social media experience and that of others who want to meet you.</p><h3> And if you disagree, let me know! I like to hear differing opinions.</h3>",

    "title": "Advisors: Trade Practice and Conflicts",
    "link": "advisors-trade-practice-and-conflicts",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Michael Conlon</p><p> Registered Investment Advisors have fairly broad discretion in constructing their trading practices to their specific business model and service offerings.</p><p> In doing so for your firm it is your responsibility to explain these trading practices in your Form ADV and compliance manual, and review the related policies and procedures in place to ensure they are followed consistently.</p><p> In addition, certain trading practices may create conflicts of interest which must be disclosed appropriately, and may require certain procedures in your compliance program to prevent or mitigate these conflicts from impacting your clients. Regulators look specifically for conflicts of interest between your firm, your employees, and your clients to ensure you are handling them appropriately and upholding your fiduciary duty.</p><h3> Trading Practices &amp; Conflicts In a Nutshell</h3><p> <br/> Your RIA firm must disclose to clients specific details on your conflicts of interest and other relationships that may create influence decisions made when providing client services. Below we describe the specific trading-related practices and conflicts that you may need to disclose in your Form ADV and include related policies and procedures in your compliance manual.</p><h3> Brokerage Affiliations</h3><p> <br/> If your firm places trades which result in your firm or its principals receiving an economic benefit from the trades, you must disclose this as a conflict related to your broker-dealer affiliations in your Form ADV Part 2A.</p><p> Regulators expect a higher level of care to be exercised when the broker-dealer and adviser have a relationship \"so that the adviser&rsquo;s fiduciary obligation to act solely in the interest of his beneficiary is satisfied.\"[1] The burden of justifying paying a commission rate in excess of the lowest rate available is particularly heavy. Placing trades with an affiliated broker-dealer means that you must make the good faith judgment that this broker is uniquely qualified to obtain the best price on these trades and that the trading costs are at least as favorable as those charged by other qualified brokers.</p><h3> Client Directed Brokerage</h3><p> <br/> There may be circumstances where a client asks your firm to direct their trades to a certain broker-dealer. Since this typically results in extra fees and costs in managing such an account, you will want to obtain certain documentation where the client has acknowledged this consequence in writing. You can accomplish this by obtaining written instructions from the client regarding the directed brokerage acknowledgment either as part of the client's investment advisory agreement or by separate written acknowledgement signed by the client and a representative of the firm.</p><p> Client directed brokerage transactions may result in the client receiving a price that is less favorable than the price your firm could obtain by batching their trade along with those of other clients. They may also result in higher commissions or less favorable net prices than might achieved if your firm was empowered to select the broker-dealer. If you accept client directed brokerage, this must be disclosed in your Form ADV Part 1 and the consequences described above must be disclosed to clients in Form ADV Part 2A.</p><h3> Soft Dollars</h3><p> <br/> Your RIA firm may direct brokerage transactions to broker-dealers who provide research services to your firm consistent with the safe harbor provision under Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934.</p><p> Only research products and services that are used for the benefit of clients may be obtained with client commission dollars. The amount of the commission paid must be reasonable in relation to the value of the research services provided by the broker-dealer. By obtaining soft dollar products, and services via soft dollars, it is expected that you are doing so to reduce expenditures you would otherwise obtain via \"hard dollars\".</p><p> When utilizing soft dollars, your firm will be expected to maintain a complete set of books and records that quantify soft dollar commissions paid and the nature of all services received.</p><h3> Principal and Agency Trades</h3><p> <br/> Principal and agency transactions are two examples where your firm has an interest in the circumstances or outcome of the client trades that then becomes a conflict of interest in the discretion or recommendation of that transaction.</p><p> Principal trades involve securities transactions in which your firm has a proprietary interest in the securities being traded. Principal transactions must be disclosed to the client in writing prior to the completion of the transaction. Written client consent must also be obtained. This consent may be obtained after execution, but prior to settlement, of the transaction.</p><p> Agency trades involve securities transactions in which your firm acts directly (or through an affiliate) as the client&rsquo;s advisor and as broker for the person on the other side of the transaction. Advisors may execute agency trades as long as they can show that they are in the best interests of the advisory clients involved in the transaction.</p><p> For both principal and agency trades, your firm must disclose this in Form ADV Parts 1 and 2A and maintain appropriate documentation to support these transactions.</p><h3> Cross Trades</h3><p> <br/> Cross trades are when clients of the same portfolio manager exchange the same security, that is, the buy and sell are offset without the need of going to the exchange for a participant in the trade. It is permissible as long as it is recorded as a cross trade by the broker and manager and providing fair market value, and that it was in the best interests of each participating client.</p><h3> Trade Aways</h3><p> <br/> Trade away transactions may become warranted when your firm's existing broker-dealer does not have access to markets that are suitable for your particular clients. As data regarding execution becomes more tangible through technology, best execution gains more transparency and may create obligations on advisors to select other advisors or relationships to ensure they uphold their client duties.</p><p> For both cross trades and trade away relationships, your firm must disclose this in Form ADV Parts 1 and 2A and maintain appropriate documentation to support these transactions.</p><h3> Absorbing Transaction Costs</h3><p> <br/> In some instances, RIA firms absorb ticket charges or other transaction-based costs for client trading, typically known as a wrap program. If you absorb ticket charges for any of your clients this may present a conflict due to your incentive to minimize trading volume. Wrap program information must be disclosed in your Form ADV Part 1 and 2A.</p><h3> Through the Regulator's Eyes</h3><p> <br/> Regulators operate under the premise that transaction costs and commissions paid are the client&rsquo;s property, so you must treat them as such and ensure that the benefits of these ultimately benefit the client and contribute to your fiduciary duty.</p><p> When circumstances exist that would alter your objectivity with respect to trading, such as noted the conflicts described above, these must be clearly disclosed as well.</p><h3> CCO Best Practices for Trading Practices and Conflicts <br/>  </h3><li> Review your firm's Form ADV Part 1 and 2A to confirm that each of these trading practices are appropriately disclosed.</li><li> In instances where conflicts of interest result, confirm that they are properly disclosed in Form ADV Part 2A in a way that identifies the conflict, why it is a conflict, and what procedures you have in place to prevent or mitigate these conflicts.</li><li> Maintain books and records that document all client directed brokerage, soft dollar usage, principal trades, agency trades, cross trades, and trade aways. Each must be maintained for at least five years, two of which must be immediately accessible by your firm.</li><li> For trades placed through an affiliated broker-dealer, maintain documentation that demonstrates the rationale for selecting this affiliate over other qualified broker-dealers.</li><li> If you utilize soft dollars, maintain a soft dollar policy that explains the rules related to paying for research with client commissions, the actual amounts paid and the specific services received.</li>[1] Securities and Exchange Commission, News Digest, Issue No. 72-89, May 10, 1972.<p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Americans once defined success mainly by whether they owned a house or were better off than their parents. <strong>  Today, it&rsquo;s a debt-free college education and a comfortable retirement </strong> .</p><p> U.S. adults feel that their top indicator of financial success is having enough money in the bank to retire (28 percent of adults), followed by sending their kids to college without having to borrow to pay for it (23 percent), according to a telephone  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aicpa.org/press/pressreleases/2015/pages/survey-finds-comfortable-retirement-defines-success.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   survey  </a> </u>  sponsored by the American Institute of CPAs. Homeownership and upward mobility each came in at a distant 11 percent of the adults, age 18 and up, randomly surveyed by Harris Poll.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;No longer are homeownership and upward financial mobility the hallmarks of financial achievement,&rdquo; </strong> said Ernie Almonte, chairman of the CPA Institute&rsquo;s Financial Literacy Commission. <strong>  &ldquo;Americans have changed the benchmarks for their financial success.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> More than half of those surveyed also felt that Millennials will enjoy less upward mobility than previous generations.</p><p> The implication of having two of life&rsquo;s largest expenditures &ndash; college and retirement &ndash; pushed on to the individual is sinking in. Social Security and traditional employer pensions are the primary sources of  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IB_14-151.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   income  </a> </u>  for most retirees today. But the shift to our DIY retirement system for future retirees has left more than half of American workers at risk of having a lower standard of living when they retire, up from about  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/briefs/nrri-update-shows-half-still-falling-short/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one-third in 1983  </a> </u> .</p><p> At the same time,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.acenet.edu/the-presidency/columns-and-features/Pages/state-funding-a-race-to-the-bottom.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   cuts  </a> </u>  in public funding for U.S. colleges and soaring tuitions have increasingly required the middle class to either save or borrow for college. This is a stark contrast to the 1960s and 1970s, when baby boomers&rsquo; parents often could pay their offspring&rsquo;s lower tuitions out of their current income. With more Americans than ever attending college, the new goal is being able to afford it.</p><p> Almonte, who is a CPA, said his Millennial-aged clients not only have student debt but also may have been affected by watching their parents&rsquo; home values plummet during the Great Recession &ndash; and he&rsquo;s seen this reflected in a hesitance about taking on a mortgage. Millennials &ldquo;saw that squeeze and became more risk averse,&rdquo; he said.</p><p> Their parents also face a generational  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/kids%E2%80%99-college-trumps-parents%E2%80%99-retirement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   dilemma  </a> </u> . Footing the bill for their children&rsquo;s college education may jeopardize their own retirement. But having their adult children pay could delay major life decisions and expenditures, such as starting their own family or buying a house.</p><p> Almonte&rsquo;s recommendation &ndash; you&rsquo;ve heard it before on this blog &ndash; is to <strong>  &ldquo;save early on and make informed decisions&rdquo; </strong> to meet the growing challenges of achieving the new American Dream.</p>",

    "link": "flexing-your-financial-muscles-five-simple-tips-for-financial-fitness",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> According to a recent <u>  <a href=\"https://mediaroom.tdbank.com/fiscalfitsurvey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TD Bank Fiscal Fit  </a> </u> survey, seven out of 10 Americans feel that sound financial health can have a positive impact on overall health and well-being. For those who have a financial plan in place, the number increases to eight out of 10.</p><p> However, as many continue to focus on their 2015 health and fitness efforts (and probably increasing momentum for the summer!), I&rsquo;ve noticed a number of people delay pursuing their financial goals. Some aren&rsquo;t sure where to begin, while others feel overwhelmed about the perceived time and effort. The sooner you start investing in your financial future, however, the more time you have to build a healthy life and enjoy the fruits of your labor.</p><p> With the strong correlation of well-being and financial health, it only makes sense that we should all be working hard on our financial fitness. Below are my simple tips for building a healthy financial life:</p><h3> Identify Goals &amp; Create a Plan.</h3><p> <br/> Similar to outlining your fitness goals, such as improving flexibility, strength training or lowering body fat, it&rsquo;s important to write down your financial goals. The specifics may change over the years, as you raise a family or embark on a new career, but the overarching goal and your commitment should remain fairly consistent. So, consider the end-game. Are you looking to accumulate wealth? Plan for retirement or a child&rsquo;s college education? Or do you want to set a good example for your children and make sure your dependents are taken care of? Then, create a plan to get there.</p><h3> Start Out Slow.</h3><p> <br/> Most fitness trainers advise against an all-out body-straining routine on Day 1. Instead, a slow ramp up process is recommended to avoid injuries that can further hinder your fitness goals. The same applies to financial planning. For instance, start your savings out slowly&mdash;you don&rsquo;t need to immediately put half of your paycheck into savings. While that&rsquo;s an ambitious goal, you can start with allocating $10-$20 per paycheck and raise the amount as more comfortable.</p><p> Starting out slow can prevent you from jeopardizing your financial future. For instance, just because you&rsquo;re determined to build wealth, doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to immediately purchase a home. In fact, that may seriously damage your financial health and hurt you in the long-run. </p><h3> Commit to Financial Health.</h3><p> <br/> In fitness, mental preparation is key. In addition to creating a plan and getting started, athletes practice mental skills to get to the next level and beyond. In building your financial health, it&rsquo;s also important to be confident, driven and focused.</p><p> Consider the big picture. In addition to putting the gym time in, athletes make better choices with their diets, for example. The same goes for financial health&mdash;having an investment strategy or retirement plan in place is great&mdash;now maximize your financial health by reducing fees and taxes, saving more of your paycheck and optimizing your charitable contributions.</p><h3> Streamline the Journey &amp; Have Fun.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s easy to skip the same boring workout, especially when it&rsquo;s in an inconvenient location, or you are feeling tired or not sure if your efforts are paying off. In San Diego, many have turned to boot camps, CrossFit or stand-up-paddleboarding to break the routine. Others work out with friends or have invested in a personal trainer to keep themselves accountable and have the best experience.</p><p> In building your financial strength, I recommend streamlining the process to ensure your goals are on track. For instance, automate your savings plan. I bet you won&rsquo;t even miss the funds automatically transferred to your account but you&rsquo;ll feel the difference. Also, find a financial planner you trust and enjoy working with. Not only will he or she help with accountability, but you may appreciate the journey and really feel the progress.</p><h3> Run a Progress Report.</h3><p> <br/> Speaking of progress, it&rsquo;s a common fitness practice to check in on your development. Some people record times, repetitions or weights; others do a monthly workout fitness text. When it comes to checking on your finances, the important thing is to check in and make sure you plan is on track, and you&rsquo;re making strides in the right direction. You can do this weekly, monthly or even bi-annually. Having a financial roundtable is especially important when you share financial responsibility with others, such as a spouse. The report is a great time to see your overall financial picture and ensure you are both on the same page.</p><p> Most people focus on fitness to live a longer and healthier life. And the longer we live, the more important finances become&mdash;particularly when it comes to saving and retirement planning. So, as you continue to ramp up our fitness efforts this year, consider making strides on your financial plan. Starting is half the battle so create a plan, start slow and before you know it, you&rsquo;ll build a financially healthy life, which can have a positive effect on your overall health and well-being.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> When you're an adult, having a birthday can suck.</p><p> I have no problem with getting older. In fact, the older I get, the happier I am.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t like them because I can&rsquo;t honestly answer the question, &ldquo;What do you want for your birthday?&rdquo;</p><p> The socially appropriate answer for my age is some version of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anything, but thank you for the sentiment!&rdquo; Had you asked me that when I was a kid, I wouldn&rsquo;t have hesitated to describe the top 3 things I wanted with enough detail to make you regret asking in the first place. So what changed?</p><p> Am I more mature? Yes. <br/> Am I less frivolous? Sure. <br/> Am I less deserving? No!</p><h3> As We Get Older, A Few Things Happen:  <br/>  </h3><li> We&rsquo;re conditioned to believe that wanting is selfish.</li><li> We experience not getting what we want and decide that it&rsquo;s safer not to want things in the first place.</li><li> We focus on giving to others at the expense of receiving. <br/>  </li><p> Put this all together and it&rsquo;s no wonder that we don&rsquo;t even know what we want in the first place. Sure, the socially acceptable dreams of starting a family and having a great career are considered fine. But what about the dreams that don&rsquo;t fit into the norm?  To accommodate them, we made sure whatever dreams we had were small and/or secret. That way, we wouldn&rsquo;t offend anyone. And if they didn&rsquo;t come to pass, we could deny (to ourselves and others) wanting them in the first place.</p><p> But all this is contrary to our purpose. We were designed to dream big, not to play small.</p><h3> So How Do You Figure Out Your Wants and Deeper Desires?</h3><p> <br/> By getting curious:</p><p> Start by jotting down any dream, wish, or passing fancy that comes to mind. Don&rsquo;t over think it. It can be material, about people, or about you. Then ask yourself:</p><li> How hard was it to identify those 5 wants?</li><li> Did you feel embarrassment or any other emotions as you acknowledged them?</li><li> Are there any patterns? (Are they all about relationships? Career?) Describe any patterns in detail.</li><li> For each want, identify the primary reason you have not actualized this dream.</li><li> Is there a pattern to your reasons? Describe in detail. <br/>  </li><p> Get curious about your motivations and the roadblocks that hold you back. From there you&rsquo;ll be equipped with everything you need to identify your dreams and step into your potential.</p><p> So next year, when someone asks me what I want for my birthday, I vow to stop stumbling through the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything&rdquo; response and confidently state, &ldquo;Fancy juicer, please!&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Daily Behaviors</h3><p> <br/> Your ability to inspire and influence, as a leader, is tied directly to your daily behaviors. These behaviors need to be based on your core values and they need to support a strong, shared vision. Your leadership should never be about you; your focus every day should be on creating win-win situations where not only the organization wins, but employees win. If you can successfully create these situations, you also win as an effective leader.</p><p> The performance of any one individual is linked to the health of the culture as a whole, and culture grows out of your leadership behaviors. Your behaviors lead to effective leadership when you appreciate the value in the contribution of each individual and invest in helping your employees grow. Show your employees that you care about them as individuals on a daily basis. Serve as a coach and a cheerleader for your team. If you A.C.E. your daily behaviors you will become a more effective leader.</p><h3> Acknowledge</h3><p> <br/> Tim Ferriss explained, &ldquo;For most people, happiness in life is a massive amount of achievement plus a massive amount of appreciation. And you need both of those things.&rdquo; Your employees need to know that you care. They need to see that you recognize and appreciate that everyone has something of value to offer. Get to know your employees and make them feel valued on an individual level. Express sincere, specific appreciation. Acknowledge progress and potential by providing opportunities to gain further experience and knowledge; seek to promote from within when possible. Share the credit; acknowledge that you accomplish nothing alone.</p><h3> Communicate</h3><p> <br/> Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about communication. It&rsquo;s about honesty. It&rsquo;s about treating people in the organization as deserving to know the facts. You don&rsquo;t try to give them half the story. You don&rsquo;t try to hide the story. You treat them as true equals and you communicate and you communicate and communicate.&rdquo; As a leader, you must invest in relationships and building trust on a daily basis. You need to communicate your passion in a way that will connect others to your vision, mission, and current focus. You need to be transparent and share pertinent information so that employees not only have the information needed to do their jobs but also to feel they are an important part of a long-term vision and goal. Above all else, you must learn to be good at listening. When you listen, it shows your employees that you care. When they know you care, they put their trust in you and will give 100% to their work.</p><h3> Engage</h3><p> <br/> Rupert Murdoch believes, &ldquo;In motivating people you&rsquo;ve got to engage their minds and their hearts. I motivate people, I hope, by example- and perhaps by excitement, by having productive ideas to make others feel involved.&rdquo; You must give your employees a reason to believe they are part of something bigger than themselves. On a daily basis you must show that you are confident in their abilities and interested in their input. Give them the opportunity to manage their own work. Provide an environment where it is safe for them to fail and learn the lessons that their mistakes have to offer. Encourage your employees to solve problems and make decisions; not because they have to, but because they want to. When you ignite passion and excitement for the vision they are contributing to reaching they will be engaged in their work and everyone will reap the benefits.</p><h3> Effective Leadership</h3><p> <br/> Effective leaders acknowledge, communicate with, and engage employees on a daily basis. They know that it&rsquo;s not about them; it&rsquo;s about those who follow them. They value the skills and knowledge that each employee brings to the table. They communicate &lsquo;with&rsquo; not &lsquo;to&rsquo; employees. They awaken excitement in working together towards a shared vision. A.C.E. your daily leadership behaviors; your ability to inspire and influence depends on it.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Writers working on anything from ad copy to executive speeches can get their creative pipes backed up. Project managers creating a robust brief can get backed up, too.</p><p> Luckily, there are many ways to flush out those pipes and get the creativity flowing once again. Here are five ways to do just that:</p><h3> Get some exercise</h3><p> <br/> No, we&rsquo;re not talking about jogging or lifting weights. We&rsquo;re talking about writing exercises.</p><p> These are our three favourites: photo-prompt writing (find an image online, write what you see and then write the story behind the photo); freewriting (write about something and just keep going); and the short-story challenge (write a short story in 100 words).</p><p> By giving yourself less time to write, you may sharpen your focus and stoke the fire you need to get your task done.</p><h3> Move</h3><p> <br/> That empty screen may be the result of your surroundings. If things are getting drab, find another desk to work at. Go to a different area in your department or, better yet, go to a different floor and start working at the first empty workstation you find.</p><h3> Bump up your deadline</h3><p> <br/> This may sound counterintuitive, but a little extra pressure can actually help. By giving yourself less time to write, you may sharpen your focus and stoke the fire you need to get your task done.</p><h3> Embrace your inner contrarian</h3><p> <br/> Write everything down that works against your position in the piece you&rsquo;re working on. It&rsquo;s natural to be uncomfortable with this technique. It is, however, an exceptionally productive exercise because you&rsquo;ll uncover potential objections and questions. But remember: the outcome of this exercise is for your eyes only.</p><h3> Out of ideas? Ask.</h3><p> <br/> Email top clients. Ask your social network. Organize an impromptu meeting with your team (five minutes maximum). Sometimes getting out of your own head for a while will clarify your thoughts. This is also a great way to ensure you&rsquo;ll end up with copy that people want to read.</p><p> We hope that the next time you feel backed up, you can try one of these tips and free that creativity flow.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you are constantly looking for new content ideas and blog topics with which to engage your target audience, you could try digging a little closer to home. What many Advisors don&rsquo;t realize is that they have valuable, ready-to-use content right at their fingertips. After all, we all know that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-content-marketing-and-how-does-it-benefit-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content marketing  </a> </u>  can take a considerable amount of time and it isn&rsquo;t always possible to be pumping out new content on a daily basis. Fortunately, great content can be repurposed into something new and different, and extend your content&rsquo;s longevity while also maximizing the reach of your content&rsquo;s idea.</p><p> Content repurposing involves taking your work and adapting it to a new content angle or format. Incorporating this approach into content marketing can help to expedite production and increase audience reach and effectiveness. In addition to saving some time on content production, repurposing your content into different formats means being able to focus on different aspects of your content.  For example, a blog post may focus on explaining some concepts of a topic, while an Infographic may focus on a different angle of the topic such as stats or data analysis. Some visitors prefer visual over text, while some would choose eBooks over Webinars. Reformatting your content in different formats means appealing to more audiences and extending your reach.</p><p> Content repurposing also gives you a second chance at promoting your content and ensures that visitors who missed your content the first time around have a chance of seeing it in round two, or three.</p><p> In part 1 of this series, we will cover off three of the ways that Advisors can repurpose in order to get the most mileage out of their content marketing.</p><h3> Content Repurposing Types</h3><h3> e-Newsletters</h3><p> <br/> If you are not feeding your content into an e-newsletter, then you&rsquo;re missing out on a way to save yourself a lot of work while also furthering your content investment along the way. Pushing out your content to your client and prospect list is a content must.  E-Newsletters are one of the easiest ways that Advisors can repurpose their content in an effective and easy way in order to engage their audience.</p><p> Advisors can actually send out an e-newsletter full of already existing content. Advisors can provide their content in their e-newsletters in its entirety, or offer a quick summary with a link to the original article on your website. E-Newsletters deliver high quality content right to your clients and prospects inboxes, while also driving traffic to your website.</p><h3> Infographics</h3><p> <br/> Visual content is not only easier and faster for the human brain to process, but it is also a great way to generate more engagement. An Infographic is a great way to present processes, statistics and other content that lends itself to more visual presentation. If you have existing content that explains a topic in a step-by-step way, shows a process, or has some interesting statistics and analysis, think about how you can present this content as a visual story.</p><h3> eBooks</h3><p> <br/> Repurpose your blog content into an eBook. You can create eBooks by compiling all of the blog posts you&rsquo;ve written about a certain topic and add additional components such as a table of contents and images to each article. Ebooks are considered to be high-value pieces since they usually include more detail then blog posts. When offering an eBook, you may be able to collect visitor information in exchange for access. Ebooks are a great way for Advisors to collect information from prospects visiting their website.</p>",

    "content": "<p> For reasons that root back to even before biblical times, <strong>  in large parts of the world women have been held back, treated as second-rate citizens, abused and belittled. </strong> Shockingly and sadly this still happens today.</p><p> The measurement of the imbalance of gender equality varies from country to country but the battle still goes on in all areas, <strong>  including domestic life and business. </strong> It&rsquo;s common knowledge that wages for women are still lower than men and boardrooms are still very male heavy. But businesses are beginning to change, Lloyds Bank for example. But are Lloyds Bank &lsquo;jumping on the trend&rsquo; and doing this as a PR stint or are they sincerely recognizing the problem? One could argue, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p><p> What we do know is that the sheer admittance of the imbalance and well-publicized and transparent efforts to change this is a true reflection of the scale of gender inequality in the workplace. We&rsquo;ve come along way since the suffragettes and powerful women over the centuries proved to a brainwashed world that <strong>  women not only have a voice but also are an intrinsic part of our present and the future of the world. </strong> Tenacious feminist movements and women-friendly companies, generation by generation have taken up the mantle and are gradually steering this huge ship of contention in a positive direction.</p><h3> But now what?</h3><p> <br/> Progress is being made. Slowly admittingly, but things are changing. Change is inevitable. But we need to adapt to change. Businesses are now publicly embracing gender equality and hopefully ergo wages will eventually align. But is it time to fall back and regroup? In any business adjustments are made according to progress. Do we need to consider a possible rebranding of feminism? Do we need to consider it at all?</p><p> There&rsquo;s been lots of discussion about this. Even the word &lsquo;feminism&rsquo; makes a lot of men and women roll their eyes. This is not to say they are misogynistic or anti-women, it&rsquo;s just the very word &lsquo;feminism&rsquo; conjures up some negative visuals for a percentage of people. I think, and have discussed this at length with feminists and women friends (is there a difference?); Is &lsquo;feminism&rsquo; being seen or at risk of being seen, as aggressive or anti-men?</p><p> The subject of emasculation runs parallel to this and has been another subject of discussion. Is &lsquo;feminism&rsquo; emasculating men? Personally, I find this very question both ridiculous and worrying. To feel that ones masculinity is in anyway at threat by women addressing gender equality puts forward the question of the individuals&rsquo; attitude towards or concept of their own masculinity. The question of labels can also be added in at this juncture. I said earlier I had discussed this with feminists and women friends, is there a difference?</p><h3> Do you have to say you&rsquo;re a feminist to agree with gender equality?</h3><p> <br/> Personally I hate labels. Why do we have have to put a name to it? There isn&rsquo;t a male equivalent. There isn&rsquo;t because it isn&rsquo;t needed. I&rsquo;m very aware that without the persistent and deeply admirable actions of feminists across the centuries we wouldn&rsquo;t be where we are today. But that is where we are now. Today. Times are continually evolving. Are feminists PR&rsquo;ing feminism as well as they could? Is feminism aligning itself with changes and progress or is it stubbornly clinging onto old tactics without reconsidering alternative ideas to strengthen itself? I wonder hypothetically if feminism didn&rsquo;t exist would gender balance have sorted it self out naturally? Is it through the constant pushing of feminists or maybe just the world evolving naturally? Probably not. In which case it emphasizes even more the importance of ensuring that gender balance is aligned.</p><h3> The key to changing attitudes is in education.</h3><p> <br/> We have to get to the root of the problem. We have to educate our children in the importance of gender equality. We don&rsquo;t teach them as if it&rsquo;s a new way of looking at things, we don&rsquo;t make comparisons, we <strong>  just merely teach balance and equality as a natural state. </strong> As with the different attitudes in homosexuality that are becoming clear between Generation X and Generation Y the same attitude with gender equality must be embedded. They are the future. Generation Y accept homosexuality as a part of life. We must ensure they also accept gender equality as natural too.</p><p> But the question remains&hellip;Do we need to rebrand Feminism?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Looking from the outside in, social media management can, at first, appear to be very much at the 'falling off a log' end of the B2B marketing spectrum. The informal nature of social media apparently gives businesses license to say and do pretty much as they please. And, once you've learned the basics, isn't all this tweeting, sharing and liking caper actually bit of a doddle?</p><p> Anyone approaching social media marketing with that attitude is in for a rude awakening. Once you realise that no one seems to want to follow, connect or engage with you, it will become clear that there&rsquo;s a lot more to this than meets the eye. And you&rsquo;ll be asking the age-old question: <strong>  \"What are other people doing that I'm not?\" </strong></p><p> In a useful article on the Business2Community website, Carter Hostelley has identified four ways in which he believes B2B firms are getting social media wrong:</p><h3> 1. You've failed to identify your target buyers' social media habits</h3><p> What type of content are your buyers actively engaging with on social media? Without knowing this sort of basic information, you're effectively guessing as to what content will prove a winner when you hit share.</p><p> However, you can quickly gain an insight into your target buyers' social media patterns by investing in a structured social listening programme. Listening is NOT an optional extra. It lies at the heart of any effective social media strategy and if you&rsquo;re not prepared to invest time and effort into getting this element right you may as well give up now.</p><h3> 2. You're taking a hard-sell approach to content</h3><p> Both social media and content marketing require a deft touch. Sure, you'll want readers to come away thinking \"I really like what that company has to offer\", but you have to allow them to make their own minds up.</p><p> Therefore, in the main, keep the promotional messages to a minimum and make posts genuinely interesting, without any obvious agenda.</p><h3> 3. You're ignoring the &lsquo;quality, not quantity&rsquo; mantra</h3><p> Your posts are only as good as the quality of your followers or connections. You can curate the most wonderful industry-specific content in the world, but if your followers have no interest in that subject matter, it will all be in vain.</p><p> It's vital, therefore, that your follower base has a strong core of clients, partners, staff, industry influencers and prospective buyers &ndash; people that are most likely to engage with your social media offerings. Thousands of irrelevant followers and connections might give you a short-term ego boost, but they&rsquo;ll do nothing whatsoever to help deliver meaningful results.</p><h3> 4. Your posts are sporadic and inconsistent</h3><p> Are your social media posts like London buses - you wait hours for one then a whole bunch of them arrive all together? Do you even know what the optimum time is for posting on Twitter or LinkedIn? If not, you're missing a trick; that time should be informing when you post, rather than just when you have a spare half an hour. </p><p> Perhaps time is the issue? If so, consider outsourcing your social media management, as it is crucial that you give social media the level of focus and resources its strategic importance merits nowadays.</p><h3> Be honest with yourself: are you guilty of any of the above?</h3>",

    "content": "<h3> We have known for some time that television watching can disturb sleep.</h3><p> <br/> In fact, several studies have demonstrated that in children, adolescents, and adults, television watching not only inhibits falling asleep, but also staying asleep, even after it is turned off.</p><p> We now have a study published in the March issue of the journal Chest titled Sitting and Television Viewing: Novel Risk Factors for Sleep Disturbance and Apnea Risk? Results from the 2013 National Sleep Foundation Sleep in America Poll. <br/> Over 1000 volunteers in this study were asked questions about how long they sat watching television daily, and questions about the quality and duration of sleep. They also answered a questionnaire that is very sensitive for sleep apnea. <br/> The findings were truly remarkable. As expected, sitting for long periods was associated with poorer sleep quality. However, sitting in front of the television for prolonged periods was associated with a longer time to fall asleep, waking up too early in the morning, and a &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; of sleep apnea.</p><h3> We have known for some time that sedentary behavior can cause sleep problems.</h3><p> <br/> In fact, several studies have shown that people who exercise regularly report better sleep quality and duration. Another study published in the journal Sleep in 2011 titled The Effect of Exercise Training on Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Sleep Quality: A Randomized Controlled Trial, demonstrated that exercise independent of weight loss resulted in an improvement of sleep apnea in individuals performing 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity aerobic exercise.</p><p> This is the first study to demonstrate that sitting while watching television is associated with sleep apnea. Interestingly, this relationship held for both obese and non-obese subjects. It certainly makes sense that those who are more physically active spend less time in front of the television. However, as to why those who sat in front of the TV, as opposed to those who sit but do not watch had a greater propensity to develop sleep apnea is not known at this time. It is theorized that most TV watching occurs close to bedtime, resulting in the blue light exposure effects on sleep. Also, late fluid changes in response to sitting, which may contribute to sleep apnea, are occurring closer to bedtime.</p><p> The take home message is that a sedentary way of life is bad for your health and sleep. However, it would appear that a sedentary life style mixed with excessive television watching is much worse. <strong>  If you want good healthy sleep, get up and turn off the television. </strong></p>",

They&rsquo;re the innovators, the thought leaders, and it pays to keep up with their decisions, behavior and opinions.</p><p> This is especially true in investing.</p><p> The most recent chief executive officer to receive such compensation is American Airline&rsquo;s Doug Parker.</p><p> Anyone can give you tips on how to get ahead in the market. Maybe you&rsquo;ve even dispensed some sage advice to friends and family yourself over the years. No offense to you, your cousin or your neighbor, but before making any trading decisions, it&rsquo;s usually constructive to first figure out where the smart money is headed.</p><p> But where do you go for such data? A good place to start is the bull/bear ratio.</p><p> Since 1987, Investors Intelligence has released such an indicator on a weekly basis that tracks the market sentiment of professional traders. High readings indicate bearishness; low readings, bullishness.</p><p> Currently, the ratio&rsquo;s 52-week moving average stands at a record high of 3.5.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/FT-BUllishness-Among-Market-Professionals-Is-Extremely-High_05062015-lg.gif\"/></p><p> For the past decade and a half, this indicator has been more-or-less accurate at following the peaks and valleys of the S&amp;P 500 Index. When the index plunged dramatically in 2008-2009 with the rest of the market, pro investors, motivated by cheap stocks and the huge potential for growth, became bullish.</p><p> The reverse is also true. The bull run we&rsquo;re now in is six years old&mdash;one of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11099\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   longest in U.S. history  </a> </u> &mdash;and domestic equities are at record highs. What&rsquo;s helped push the market higher this cycle are low interest rates and billions in dividends. For the first time last year, U.S. companies gave back $1 trillion to investors in stock buybacks and dividends, and even more is expected this year.</p><p> As a result, some top traders seem to be anticipating the next shoe to drop.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/Market-Sentiment-among-Professional-Investors-and-the-SP500-Index-05-2015-lg.gif\"/></p><p> So what does this mean? Of course, there&rsquo;s no way to predict what will happen in the future with full certainty.</p><p> Having said that, it might be time to rebalance your portfolio by taking some profits from the best-performing assets and reallocating them into assets that are out of favor right now&mdash;or better yet, into a product that has a time-tested history of no drama. Research has shown that a systematic approach to asset allocation with regular rebalancing might lower your risk and enhance your returns.</p><p> For 20 consecutive years, our Near-Term Tax Free Fund (NEARX), which invests in short-term municipal bonds, has delivered positive total returns in both weak and strong economic climates, no matter if the pros are bearish or bullish.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jan-Jun/Near-Term-Tax-Free-Fund-Annual-Total-Return-since-1995-02062015-lg.gif\"/> <br/> The fund holds four stars overall from Morningstar, among 179 Municipal National Short-Term funds as of 3/31/2015, based on risk-adjusted return.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Many leaders are guilty of making bad promotion decisions. Such decisions are most detrimental in small- to medium-sized companies&ndash;where the &ldquo;ripple-effect&rdquo; is boundless&ndash;versus larger institutions.</p><p> Consider the following:</p><p> A CEO was walking to her office when she heard yelling. One of her newly-promoted managers was scolding a new hire, just three weeks out of college. The reprimand was about details being missed in a recent &ldquo;deliverable&rdquo; to a client. The manager barked, &ldquo;Do you see how you make me look? What the @!#% were you thinking? Are you an idiot? Your job is on the line.&rdquo;</p><p> One has to wonder, was this new manager being reasonable to expect the new hire (with no work experience) to know all the finer points, nuances and intricacies of the business and the client? Was the CEO partially to blame? Was she guilty of the classic faux pas of promoting her best salesperson to sales manager?</p><p> The potential outcomes of the newly-promoted manager&rsquo;s rant:</p><li> New hire quits.</li><li> New hire tells friends/family about the experience, which impacts the company &ldquo;brand.&rdquo; Potential customers and employees avoid the organization.</li><li> Word of the altercation spreads. Other employees avoid the new manager.</li><li> New manager gets frustrated and resigns, joining the competition and taking the business&rsquo; client-base.</li><li> Other employees fear similar attacks, so they become reticent to share creativity and innovation.</li><li> The new manager and new hire both depart, leaving Pat with vacancies that could take six months to fill. Opportunity costs skyrocket and profitability falls short of projections. <br/>  </li><p> In order to establish and sustain growth for their small to medium-sized organizations, leaders often feel immediate action is best in these kinds of situations. The &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in their heads tells them to do the following as quickly as possible:</p><li> Grow the business</li><li> Establish the brand</li><li> Capture market-share</li><li> Increase profitability</li><li> Show upward mobility</li><li> Ensure client retention</li><li> Reward perceived best employees</li><li> Retain perceived best employees <br/>  </li><p> For many, this is a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; tactic and a formula for disaster.</p><p> When the CEO was asked why she promoted her top salesperson to manager, she replied, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to lose him to the competition. He does great work. The clients love him. The only way to pay him more&ndash;based on our pay scale&ndash;was to promote him.&rdquo;</p><p> While great leaders know they need business plans, marketing plans, sales plans, and communication plans to be successful, few understand that promotion plans are just as necessary.</p><li> Did the CEO have support from her executive team or was this a unilateral decision?</li><li> Did she ever consider the maturity of the individual and his capacity to think of the well-being and development of others?</li><li> Did this person want the promotion, and was it ever discussed as part of his professional development?</li><li> Is this person considered a team player or an individual contributor? <br/>  </li><p> As a leader, you want great managers working for you. When looking to promote individuals from a senior position to a managerial position, consider the following:</p><li> Natural Communication Styles: How do these people relate to others and influence others? Do they foster collaborative relationships or are they more &ldquo;command and demand&rdquo; types?</li><li> What are the influences that have shaped these people into who they are?</li><li> What are their motivations? Why do they do what they do? How do they work with others? Do they work through others to achieve their results?</li><li> Do they see others as tools? Do only the outcomes matters?</li><li> Do they see people as compliments/supplements to their own skills, experiences, and natural tendencies? Will they hire individuals to ensure success, or would they hire individuals simply to support their rise to the next level?</li><li> Are they aware of their own developmental needs? Do they constantly judge and compare themselves to others?</li><li> Are they &ldquo;givers&rdquo;? Do they constantly consider what&rsquo;s best for the greater good of the organization? Or, are they &ldquo;takers,&rdquo; always tuned into &ldquo;WIIFM&rdquo; (What&rsquo;s In It For Me)? <br/>  </li><p> When promoting individuals, great leaders find success when they collaborate with their executive teams and prepare their organizations. They know that without support from all those involved they have an equation for failure.</p><p> Making promotion decisions in a vacuum, without structure and guidelines in place, will wreak havoc with the company in ways a leader cannot imagine. One person can have a major impact on the success of the business. Let that person be you, the leader to choose fellow leaders aligned with your strategic outcomes and heart-felt desires.</p><p> The choice is yours!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Ron Lieber&rsquo;s best selling book,  &ldquo;The Opposite of Spoiled: Raising Kids Who Are Grounded, Generous and Smart About Money&rdquo;  kicked open the door for parents to start talking with their kids about money. And not just about money, but why making choices is such an important life skill. Who would argue that giving kids the tools to make smart decisions could be anything but life-shakingly positive?</p><p> In certain ways, it pairs wonderfully with Walter Mischel&rsquo;s book,  &ldquo;The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control.&rdquo;  The book is centered on a test where kids were placed in a room with a marshmallow and told if they don&rsquo;t eat it, they would get two when the adult returns to the room. The results? The kids with self- control were more likely to have higher test scores, better social and cognitive functioning and a greater sense of self-worth. The connection between mastering self-control and introducing money choices is like PB&amp;J. </p><p> Those who have good money habits and values-based behavior have an important lesson to teach their children through discussion and modeling. The problem: too many adults don&rsquo;t have the right skills to teach their children.</p><p> If you grew up watching your parents spend money trying to show the world their success&mdash;you are likely to do the same. Why? Because it is your normal.</p><p> If you watched your parents make careful money decisions, that became your normal and chance are you have mirrored their behavior.</p><p> But both sets of parents probably never sat down and talked about money making, money saving, charity, needs vs. wants and the &ldquo;things&rdquo; families value most.</p><p> Ron Lieber&rsquo;s book is a celebration of great ideas to structure conversations and highlights the creativity and success many families are experiencing by opening the closely guarded gate of personal financial information.</p><p> I have yet to hear a parent disagree with the statement that the first job of a parent is to prepare children to be  <strong>  self-sufficient, independent and resilient humans&mdash;able to make their way in the world. </strong> Yet even so, many parents are appalled at the notion of sharing personal information such as their earnings and the cost of running the household. Lieber&rsquo;s study illustrates that that is in fact, the right way to go, especially if you&rsquo;re trying to build understanding, conversation and a sense that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all in this together&rdquo; as a family unit.</p><h3> Learning has to start somewhere.</h3><p> <br/> If you have knowledge gaps in your understanding about money, there are many great sources to help you.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re comfortable with your understanding, but haven&rsquo;t found a reason or a path to talking with your children about money, grab Ron&rsquo;s book and use it as a guide to opening the dialogue. Talking about choices, self-control, savings, giving, financial security and healthy habits are wonderful conversations.</p><p> If you thought handing your kids a weekly allowance was enough of a money education or that parents should simply provide everything their children need, you are in for an eye-opening ride when you read this book.</p><p> That old money taboo has been banished forever, in favor of helping to create self-reliant, independent, resilient adults of the future.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Who&rsquo;s interested in working with an average business coach? </strong></p><h3> Didn&rsquo;t think so.</h3><p> <br/> So, who is interested in working with Australia&rsquo;s best business coach?</p><p> If you&rsquo;re like most people, your next question is probably along the lines of, &ldquo;What do you mean by best? How do you define that?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Best&rdquo; means different things to different people. For some it&rsquo;s about the most experienced. Others would look for clear, tangible outcomes. A  large number would be keen to find the best option at a certain price point. I&rsquo;d love to hire Anthony Robbins to work with me, but he&rsquo;s too expensive to be the best for me.</p><p> The Best is a personal thing. However, I&rsquo;m pretty confident that all us would agree that we&rsquo;d prefer to work with those who are exceptional, well above average and absolutely top of their game when it comes to their chosen field of expertise.</p><h3> So, what makes you an exceptional adviser?</h3><p> <br/> This is an important question. I had the pleasure last month of reading Seth Godin&rsquo;s book The Dip. It&rsquo;s a great read that can be finished in under two hours, full of motivating insight into the path to success.</p><p> One concept struck a chord, that of aiming for nothing less than being the best.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re serious about building a successful business, and I mean one that makes excellent profits AND creates the best possible outcomes for clients, what&rsquo;s the point aiming for anything less than being exceptional?</p><p> The world rewards those who are exceptional disproportionately to those who are simply excellent, good or ok. It rewards them with the ability to influence the world around them with far greater impact.</p><p> So, what does it mean to be an exceptional adviser?</p><h3> What would it mean to absolutely hit the highest echelons of this industry.</h3><p> <br/> Here are some thoughts:</p><li> It would mean being more educated, qualified and informed that every one of your peers in the areas that matter to your clients.</li><li> It would mean having a business that is absolutely bulletproofed from the impact of the changing world around it and confident that it can fulfil the promise of being there today, tomorrow and twenty years into the future.</li><li> It would mean paying absolute attention to the changing needs of clients and reacting, or predicting, how to meet those needs before they manifest.</li><li> It would mean making changes to your business not in response to legislation, but in expectation of the road well ahead. <br/>  </li><p> I also read a wonderful article a couple of weeks back, documenting an interview with  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk\" target=\"_blank\">   Elon Musk  </a> </u> &lsquo;s first wife, Justine. I&rsquo;d like to share that with you too.</p><p> She was asked online, &ldquo;Will I become a billionaire if I am determined to be one and put in all the necessary work required?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;No&ldquo;, she said simply, &ldquo;Determination isn&rsquo;t enough&rdquo;.</p><p> &ldquo;You have to move your focus away from what you want and get deeply, intensely curious about what the world wants and needs&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;You have to ask yourself what you have the potential to offer that is so unique and compelling and helpful that no computer could replace you, no one could outsource you, no one could steal your product and make it better and then club you into oblivion. Then develop that potential.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;You have to choose one thing and become a master of it. Choose a second thing and become a master of that. When you become a master of two worlds, you can bring them together in a way that will a) introduce hot ideas to each other, so they can have idea sex and make idea babies that no one has seen before and b) create a competitive advantage because you can move between worlds, speak both languages, connect the tribes, mash the elements to spark fresh creative insight until you wake up with the epiphany that changes your life.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;The world doesn&rsquo;t throw a billion dollars at a person because the person wants it or works so hard they feel they deserve it. The world does not care what you want or deserve. The world gives you money in exchange for something it perceives to be of equal or greater value: something that transforms an aspect of the culture, reworks a familiar story or introduces a new one, alters the way people think about the category and make use of it in daily life.&rdquo;</p><h3> Exceptional.</h3>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattcooksales\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Matthew Cook  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://www.saleshub.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SalesHub  </a> </u> It's more important than ever that your website is mobile optimized. More and more people are using mobile devices to browse the internet, whether they're at home, in the office, or on the go.Some business owners make the mistake of assuming people only use mobile devices while they're out to look for restaurants and the like. They make the mistake of thinking that it's not worth the cost of optimizing their site for mobile because their particular business doesn't need to be accessible via mobile.You couldn't be more wrong. People use their smartphones to browse the internet while they watch TV at home, during long commutes, and even while they're on computers. In today's digitally driven society, we want to multitask and use a variety of devices for any number of things simultaneously. Don't alienate your prospects by neglecting mobile optimization. It's well worth the investment. Here are five reasons why mobile optimization is super  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.square2marketing.com/blog/does-your-website-really-need-to-be-mobile-optimized\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   important for your website  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 1. Increase Accessibility</h3>You want to make it as easy as possible for people to find your website. If prospects are trying to access your website on their mobile devices, you want them to be able to find it and access it quickly and easily. Once they find it, it needs to be simple to read and navigate. With the ever-improving functionality of mobile technology, it's no wonder people are searching and browsing more and more on their smartphones. Don't alienate your prospects. Make your company website as accessible as possible.<h3> 2. Offer Convenience</h3>It's frustrating when you're using a mobile device and you get to a website only to discover that it takes forever to load, the font size is impossible to read, and it's tricky to navigate. No one wants to have to pinch, zoom, and scroll around just to read a little paragraph. No one has the patience for this. There's nothing stopping your prospects from leaving your site and heading over to a competitor's mobile optimized site instead. If checking out your website is inconvenient, no one is going to bother with it. A mobile site should load in less than three seconds. If it's taking too long, your prospects will take their business elsewhere.<h3> 3. Improve Search Engine Ranking</h3>Did you know that websites that are <u> <a href=\"https://www.square2marketing.com/test-blog/blog/3-reasons-you-absolutely-need-a-mobile-optimized-website\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  mobile optimized rank better </a></u> than websites that are not? That's right. So even when people are using desktop computers and laptops to browse online, your site will be buried in the search results because your site isn't optimized for mobile. Make the upgrade to increase visibility on all devices.<h3> 4. Reduce Bounce Rate</h3>If your website isn't mobile optimized, you probably have a high <u> <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009409?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">  bounce rate </a></u>. This means that when people do get to your site, they don't stay long. So even if you're managing to drive traffic to your website, if people aren't satisfied with the user experience because your site lacks mobile optimization, they're just going to leave. What's the point of driving traffic to your site if everyone just abandons the site upon arrival. At this rate, you'll never generate any sales leads.<h3> 5. Generate Sales Leads</h3>If your website it difficult to use on mobile devices, you're not going to be able to generate any <u> sales leads</u>. When someone checks out your site using a mobile device, your key selling points or message should be immediately apparent. It should be easy to recognize and activate the calls to action. Without mobile optimization, you're missing potential sales and you're doing a disservice to your company.",

    "content": "<h3> 10 Things to Discuss Before the Big Day</h3><p> <br/> You are excited, in love, and planning the wedding of your dreams. Probably the only money questions on your mind are the down payments for the caterers and the florists!</p><p> Yet &ndash; whether your wedding reflects a minimalist sensibility or is a no-holds-barred extravaganza &ndash; it&rsquo;s better to have a good understanding of each other&rsquo;s finances before the &ldquo;I Do&rsquo;s&rdquo;. This is a time when procrastination could cost you a bundle, even if neither one of you currently have a lot of assets.</p><p> Getting married is more than just substituting the word &ldquo;ours&rdquo; for &ldquo;yours&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s combining your finances, histories, dreams, aspirations, possessions &ndash; even your music &ndash; and making all of that &ldquo;ours&rdquo; too. Since a significant part of those dreams and aspirations involve money, having multiple financial conversations before marriage (or right after, if you&rsquo;re newlyweds!) can help you start married life on a firmer footing, with regard to financial goals.</p><h3> Here are a few conversations that will get your marriage off to a smoother financial start:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Views on money </h3><p> <br/> How we feel about money is often very emotional and very personal. Our family&rsquo;s views on money can have a big impact on the way we see finances. In some families money may not be talked about. In others, one partner may hide money or spending from the other. While we might not consciously have these same behaviors, our upbringing will have an impact on how we feel about money and how we save, spend, and budget.</p><p> The best way to address unconscious &ndash; and sometimes conflicting &ndash; money behaviors is to start by recognizing how you each feel about money. Then you can take a practical approach and implement the best strategies from the past and incorporate them into your new relationship. This will also give you a chance to address any not-so-beneficial attitudes and behaviors and work to consciously change them.</p><h3> 2. Spending/Saving Habits </h3><p> <br/> Chances are the two of you don&rsquo;t spend and save money the same way. The interesting thing about spending and saving habits is that they give insight into priorities, both financial and otherwise because we tend to spend money on things we feel are most important and scoff at spending on things we see as unimportant.  Some people value saving more than anything and could be considered &ldquo;tightwads&rdquo;. Other people have a &ldquo;live for today&rdquo; attitude and spend whatever they have available, saving nothing or little for later. Most of us find ourselves somewhere in the middle.</p><p> Not agreeing on spending priorities can lead to serious conflicts down the line. While there is no right and wrong answer regarding priorities and habits, it&rsquo;s valuable to know and understand each other&rsquo;s habits earlier rather than later.</p><h3> 3. Divvying Up the Bills </h3><p> <br/> This is an important conversation about how you will manage your money together. Will you have separate or joint accounts? Who will be responsible for paying the bills and investing for long term goals? A realistic understanding both of your current incomes and current debts is important so you can create a realistic budget based on your combined income and expenses.</p><h3> 4. Credit History </h3><p> <br/> No one likes to talk about credit ratings because they highlight past mistakes and spending habits. Yet it&rsquo;s essential to know and discuss your credit histories. This can help you talk about past money mistakes, current debt loads, and how to address any issues that are lurking. Having this conversation now will also help if you&rsquo;re planning to borrow money for a large purchase, such as a home or car; credit history will effect how much you&rsquo;ll pay in interest for loans, as well as how much it will cost for things like insurance. Many companies even pull credit for potential job applicants. When it comes to credit, it&rsquo;s best not to have surprises down the road, so have the conversation now.</p><h3> 5. Risk Tolerance and Financial Goals</h3><p> <br/> Couples often have very strong &ndash; and differing &ndash; feelings about risk and money that are deeply rooted in past experiences.  Your family may have gone through periods of unemployment, for instance, or  you may have grown up taking financial security for granted. One of your parents may have owned a business and you saw it go bankrupt,  so you might be very conservative with your money and not want to take unnecessary chances. Or perhaps they invested in a business that was a huge success.</p><p> Everyone brings a different level of comfort when it comes to risk tolerance and it&rsquo;s important to understand your partner&rsquo;s because it has an impact on spending and savings habits &ndash; everything from where you invest to how much money you want to set aside. Money provides a level of security that can be very powerful and risk tolerance is directly linked to that feeling of security.</p><h3> 6. Ongoing Financial Obligations </h3><p> <br/> If this is a second marriage, are there child support or alimony payments that need to be considered in the budget process? If so, how much and how long will the obligations need to be fulfilled. Caring for elderly parents might also be a long term expense you will be facing as a couple.</p><h3> 7. Net Worth</h3><p> <br/> When it&rsquo;s a first marriage, often neither partner has much in the way of assets, but if one partner has more than the other, are you going to want a pre-nuptial agreement? When discussing net worth it is valuable to discuss not only current net worth, but also aspiring net worth. What household income level are you both hoping to achieve. Will reaching those aspirations include additional education? Will it mean switching jobs several times early in your career? Will it mean working 80 hours a week for decades? As a couple, understanding financial expectations and future net worth aspirations will help you plan a life together that will meet both of your needs, financially and emotionally.</p><h3> 8. Family Plans </h3><p> <br/> The family size you hope to have will also have a big impact on your financial needs. Children, as wonderful as they are, are very expensive to raise. Do you both want to have children and, if so, one child or several children? Discussions about how the children will be raised and educated are also valuable from a financial perspective. Will one of you stay home to raise the children? Will you pay for day care? How far apart should the children be? Each of these answers will have a significant financial impact to the family budget.</p><h3> 9. Combining Physical and Financial Assets </h3><p> <br/> Particularly with couples getting married later, both partners will have accumulated possessions that now need to be combined. This can be as simple as which sofa and bedroom set to keep, or more complicated when multiple homes, retirement accounts, and other investments are brought into the mix. Discussing whether property, accounts, and debt should be left in individual names or held jointly is also an important conversation to have.</p><h3> 10. Wills and Trusts</h3><p> <br/> When you&rsquo;re getting married, you don&rsquo;t really want to think about death. Yet wills and trusts need to be updated soon after you say, &ldquo;I Do.&rdquo; This is true especially if you have assets or children. The process of obtaining a will or trust is fairly straightforward; it&rsquo;s the discussions that lead up to it that provide the most value. Both of you should have a good understanding of what you have and what you want to happen, should the unthinkable occur.</p><p> Financial advisors can be a real asset, when it comes to pre-marital financial discussions. They can help you determine when it is best to hold assets jointly or separately. Assistance with budgeting and planning for long term goals will help you create a strong financial plan. Advisors can also guide you in building a strategy for reaching financial milestones.</p><p> So, if you&rsquo;re getting married (or just got married), congratulations! And while these discussions may not be the most romantic ones you&rsquo;re having, they do have the ability to bring you closer together. Planning together and sharing your dreams will give you better insight into the mind and heart of the person you&rsquo;ve fallen in love with and allow you to become stronger partners when it comes to reaching your goals as a couple, emotional as well as financial.</p>",
